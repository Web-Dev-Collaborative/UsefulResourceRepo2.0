 * Find the time and space complexity of the following program

#include <stdlib.h>

// Time: O(n+m)
// Space: O(1)

int main()

	int a = 0, b = 0, N = 10, M = 10;   
	
	// Space complexity is the extra space used by the algorithm
	// In Recursion we create stack so space complexity is O(n)
	// But in for loop space complexity is O(1) as space doesn't depend of input size
