''' Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints,
such that the group sums to the given target, with this additional constraint:
if there are numbers in the array that are adjacent and the identical value,
they must either all be chosen, or none of them chosen. For example, with the
array {1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2}, either all three 2's in the middle must be chosen or
not, all as a group. (one loop can be used to find the extent of the identical
values) '''
