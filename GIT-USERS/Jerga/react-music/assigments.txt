####### ASSIGMENT 2 #######
1. Create a new screen with a name "AlbumDetailScreen"

2. Register this screen as part of Stack navigation of HomeStack

3. Create a navigation to this screen from AlbumsScreen, create navigation on info icon press

4. When you navigating you can send some data in navigation to other screen,
   Send in navigation data of clicked album

   example: this.props.navigation.navigate('AlbumDetail', {album: album})
   or: this.props.navigation.navigate('AlbumDetail', {album})

5. This will not work yet since in our function renderBottomNavigation we dont have album

6. Go to card list component and pass 'item' to 'bottomView'
  example: bottomView(item)

7. In AlbumsScreen in renderBottomNavigation you can specify in argument of function variable 'album'

8. Voila! Now You have your album in bottom navigation and you can navigate and pass data while navigating
   as it showed in example before

10. inside of render function in AlbumDetailScreen you can access data you sent before in navigation
    example: const album = this.props.navigation.getParam('album', {});

11. console.log out or render some information of album

12. Good luck and have fun (:



####### MINI ASSIGMENT 3 #######
1. In actions/index.js create a new function to send a GET request to get tracks of album
  NOTE: You can access your tracks on response like this: "response.data.tracks.data"

2. Get this data back in componentDidMount and setState with these tracks

3. You can console.log them out or iterate them and display in render

3. Good luck and have fun (:
