Thanks for trying out GhostText and opening this issue!

Before opening an issue for a possible bug, please make sure you try GhostText in Chrome and Sublime Text.
This is the most common configuration and will help me understand better where the problem is.

If it works with Sublime Text but not with a third party editor, please open an issue in their repository.
