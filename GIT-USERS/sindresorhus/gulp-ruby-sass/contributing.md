Issues with the output should be reported on the Sass [issue tracker](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues).

Before posting an issue:

- Update to the latest version.
- Check the example tasks and available options in the readme.
- Create a reduced test case with only the gulp-ruby-sass task.
- Try running a similar command with the Sass gem directly. To see the command gulp-ruby-sass is running, add `verbose: true` to your task options.
