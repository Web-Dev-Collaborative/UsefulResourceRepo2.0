# auto-investment

This is a set of scripts I have written to automate discovery of investment opportunities.

## Working
- The script runs for free every midnight using github actions.
- It fetches the last 20 IPOs announced in Nepal, detects and adds any new IPOs to my todo list
- The task is added with a due date set to the deadline of the IPO. This is done to review subscription ratio and decide optimal number of units to apply.
