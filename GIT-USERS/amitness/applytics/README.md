Sentiment Analysis of Your App

We developed this project in a hackathon to perform sentiment analysis on reviews of mobile apps on Google Playstore. The key idea was to identify negative reviews quicker so as to avoid user churn.

### Training Data:
We scraped reviews of 23 popular mobile apps and manually labelled each data as positive or negative to create the dataset.

### Model
The project used Naive Bayes Classifier to perform the sentiment analysis which gave 85% accuracy on our validation set.

### Venue
Developed at [HackClash-Nepal 2016](https://www.facebook.com/events/183044535381401/) hackathon on 2nd & 3rd January, 2016.
