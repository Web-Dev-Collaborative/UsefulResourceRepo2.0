            <p>NepalMap makes data on Nepal more accessible and understandable.</p>
<p>NepalMap is of great use to journalists, students, academics and others who are interested in using data to learn about each district and every Village Development Committee.</p>
<p>This tool is a friendly and reliable resource for journalists who want to use data to tell stories or discover stories that are of public interest.</p>
<p>NepalMap uses data from <a href="http://www.cbs.gov.np/" target="_blank">Central Bureau of Statistics</a>, and other official sources, to create user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues.</p>
<p>You can </span><strong>embed, access or download</strong> the data too. You can also compare any two areas side-by-side. </span></p>
<p>NepalMap is a project of <a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/"><strong>Code for Nepal</strong></a>, a non-profit that works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. Please make a </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/117735" target="_blank"><strong>tax deductible donation</strong></a> to help us maintain the server space for NepalMap, and empower Nepal digitally!</p>
<p>Code for Nepal's co-founder, <a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/staff/ravinepal/" target="_blank">Ravi Kumar</a>, is grateful to all the volunteers who contributed to NepalMap! Code for Nepal is especially grateful to <a href="https://github.com/cliftonmcintosh" target="_blank">Clifton McIntosh</span></a>, for serving as the lead developer for this project. And to Code for Nepal&rsquo;s </span><a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/staff/amit-chaudhary/" target="_blank">Amit Chaudhary</a>.</p>

<p>Yes! NepalMap is based on <a href="https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap" target="_blank">Wazimap</a> which is a fork of <a href="https://censusreporter.org/" target="_blank">Census Reporter</a>. Wazimap is built and maintained by <a href="http://code4sa.org/" target="_blank">Code for South Africa</a>. Other implementations include <a href="https://kenya.wazimap.org/" target="_blank">Wazimap Kenya</a> and <a href="https://wazimap.co.za" target="_blank">Wazimap South Africa</a>, the first Wazimap implementation. All of these tools are completely open source. You can build <a href="https://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">one</a> for your country.
