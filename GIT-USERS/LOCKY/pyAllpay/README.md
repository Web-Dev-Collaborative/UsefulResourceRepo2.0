You can install using pip. [current release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyallpay)

    pip install pyallpay

Or ... clone this project and put the pyallpay folder under root directory of your project.

    git clone https://github.com/lockys/allPay.py.git

Then include pyallpay into your project if you directly cloned the source code.
```python
from pyallpay import AllPay
```
First, you are required to set your own merchant ID, HashIV, HashKey provided by the 歐付寶 in the setting.py

## Set up the /your-app/settings.py in Django
```python
ALLPAY_SANDBOX = False # False or True, The sandbox configuration depend on you.
MERCHANT_ID = 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID' # Default is '2000132'
HASH_KEY = 'YOUR_HASH_KEY' # Default is '5294y06JbISpM5x9'
HASH_IV = 'YOUR_HASH_IV' # Default is 'v77hoKGq4kWxNNIS'
RETURN_URL = 'YOUR_RETURN_URL'

## Initialize an allPay payment

Take Django as instance.([A Django example](https://github.com/lockys/allPay.py/tree/master/demo_django_app)
)
In your Django view.
```python
from pyallpay import AllPay

payment_info = {'TotalAmount': 10, 'ChoosePayment': 'ATM', 'MerchantTradeNo': 'xvd123test', 'ItemName': "test"}
ap = AllPay(payment_info)
# check out, this will return a dictionary containing checkValue...etc.
dict_url = ap.check_out()
# generate the submit form html
form_html = ap.gen_check_out_form(dict_url)
```
#### How to specify `payment_info` dictionary
```python
payment_info = {'TotalAmount': 10, 'ChoosePayment': 'ATM', 'MerchantTradeNo': 'xvd123test', 'ItemName': "test"}
```
- TotalAmount, 交易金額(Number): 10 (NTD)
- ChoosePayment, 付款方式(String): 'ATM', 'WebATM', 'CVS', 'BARCODE', 'Credit'
- MerchantTradeNo, 交易序號(String): 'serial_number' # should be generated by yourself.
- ItemName, 商品名稱(String): 'My Product'  

**Other parameters:**
- TradeDesc, 交易描述(String): 'My Product'
- ItemURL(String)
- Remark(String)
- ChooseSubPayment(String)

You can find what each parameter means at:
[AllPay Doc](https://www.allpay.com.tw/Service/API_Help?Anchor=AnchorDoc)

`form_html` is a form in HTML, pyallpay will automatically send the request to AllPay for you.
if you want to send by yourself, just disable **auto_send**, like the below code.
```python
form_html = ap.gen_check_out_form(dict_url, False)
```
and you have to do submit #allPay-Form in your JavaScript.
```javascript
$('#allPay-Form').submit();
```

## Retrive the POST data from allPay(歐付寶)
```python
from pyallpay import AllPay
returns = AllPay.checkout_feedback(request.POST) #Django for ex.
```
**returns** will be a dict. that contains the information returned from allPay(歐付寶)
For example, **returns['RtnCode']** indicates the current status of a payment.
Check out the [allPay Documentation](https://www.allpay.com.tw/Service/API_Help?Anchor=AnchorDoc) for more details.

Available payment.
==

You could simulate to pay in the administator panel provided by allPay, but you should implement the view by your own in order to catch the feedback data from allPay.

Goal:
==
This final goal for this project is to implement the full functionalities of Allpay SDK in Python language.

Project Current Status:
==
This project is still a baby. Therefore, the bugs may exist. :smiley:  
I'll try hard to implement all th methods of allPay SDK.  
**Feel free to open issues and pull request to help this project better**

Environment
==
It has been tested with Django 1.5 and python 2.7.5, and works okay for now.
