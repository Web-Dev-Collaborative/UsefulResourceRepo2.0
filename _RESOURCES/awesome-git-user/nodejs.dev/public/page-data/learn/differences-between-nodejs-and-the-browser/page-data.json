Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the <code class=\"language-text\">document</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.</p>\n<p>And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.</p>\n<p>Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use, this is very convenient.</p>\n<p>This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript that your Node.js version supports.</p>\n<p>Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow and users a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web, you are stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.</p>\n<p>You can use Babel to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser, but in Node.js, you won't need that.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that for the time being you use <code class=\"language-text\">require()</code> in Node.js and <code class=\"language-text\">import</code> in the browser.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Differences between Node.js and the Browser","description":"How writing JavaScript application in Node.js differs from programming for the
