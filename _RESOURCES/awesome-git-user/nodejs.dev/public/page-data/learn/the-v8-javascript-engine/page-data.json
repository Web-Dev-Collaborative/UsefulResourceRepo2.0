It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.</p>\n<p>V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser.</p>\n<p>The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to it V8 also powers desktop apps, with projects like Electron.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-js-engines\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#other-js-engines\" aria-label=\"other js engines permalink\" class=\"autolink-headers before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Other JS engines</h2>\n<p>Other browsers have their own JavaScript engine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox has <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey\"><strong>SpiderMonkey</strong></a></li>\n<li>Safari has <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore\"><strong>JavaScriptCore</strong></a> (also called Nitro)</li>\n<li>Edge was originally based on <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore\"><strong>Chakra</strong></a> but has more recently been <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium\">rebuilt using Chromium</a> and the V8 engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and many others exist as well.</p>\n<p>All those engines implement the <a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm\">ECMA ES-262 standard</a>, also called ECMAScript, the standard used by JavaScript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-quest-for-performance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-quest-for-performance\" aria-label=\"the quest for performance permalink\" class=\"autolink-headers before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The quest for performance</h2>\n<p>V8 is written in C++, and it's continuously improved.
