Built with Gatsby (Node.js, React, and GraphQL), HTML5, and CSS3

Designed with web developers in mind, this fully JamStack blog template was built with the Gatsby framework and is an official starter featured in the Gatsby Starter Library.

**Concept**  
Having built a web-developer blog for myself using Gatsby, I thought that if I could turn it into a template, others might use it. To set it apart from similar templates, I wanted to include some really eye-catching topic tags that included icons, I wanted to leverage the Gatsby data layer to make internal links, as the Gatsby documentation says, blazingly fast.

**Execution**  
Still being relatively new to the Gatsby framework, I initially didn't take full advantage of Gatsby's use of GraphQL to pass data into the necessary components; in some components I just passed in data as props in the usual React way of doing things. What took longest for this site template, however, was giving it the right level of mobile responsiveness.

**Result**  
Overall, for a beginner project, I'm pretty happy with the way this one turned out. So far it has 60 stars on GitHub and 21 forks. Along the way, three other people have become contributors by filing issues and submitting pull requests to fix them.
