**Past**  
*Origin:* California, USA  
*Education:* Bachelor of Science - Physics 

After university, I taught mathematics at a community college for a few years before moving to Japan to continue my career as an educator; a career which lasted 17 years. Though I studied computer science in support of a physics degree in university, I didn't start learning web development until I was 45.

**Present**  
*Role:* Full Stack Web Developer  
*Location:* Tokyo, Japan  

I work primarily in the JavaScript ecosystem. I build both REST APIs and GraphQL APIs using Node.js, and I use React heavily for building user interfaces and SPAs. 

**Future**  
*Desired role:* Senior Web Developer  
*Location:* Remote

I'm looking for a new role where I can really grow as a developer. In addition to advancing my existing skills, I would love the chance to work on projects using new technologies. I'm also interested in DevOps.
