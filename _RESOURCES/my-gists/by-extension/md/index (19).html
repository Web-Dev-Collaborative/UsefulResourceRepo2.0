<h1 id="procedurally-generated-music">Procedurally Generated Music</h1>
<p>This will infinitely generate a random song based on the <em>seed</em> that you provide it with. Procedural generation ensures that the song will always be the exact same song for the seed data you provide, but will be unique to any other seed.</p>
<p>Type anything into the input below and hit “Load” to generate and hear your song.</p>

<p><span class="small">You can download a MIDI file of whatever you have generated in the browser when you hit “Pause”. To import into Ableton, you may need to rename the extension to “.mid”. The conversion is handled by ABCjs, and the midi accuracy varies with different software.</span></p>
