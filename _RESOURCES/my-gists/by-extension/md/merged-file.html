<h1 id="authoring">Authoring</h1>
<p>This describes important stuff about authoring new articles of the tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="internal-links">Internal links</h2>
<p>All tutorial links should start from the root, not including the domain.</p>
<p>✅ OK:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">We&#39;ll cover that in the chapter <span class="ot">[about functions](/function-basics)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>❌ Not ok:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1">We&#39;ll cover that in the chapter <span class="ot">[about functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Also, to reference a chapter, there’s a special “info:” scheme, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1">We&#39;ll cover that in the chapter &lt;info:function-basics&gt;.</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1">We&#39;ll cover that in the chapter <span class="kw">&lt;a</span><span class="ot"> href=</span><span class="st">&quot;/function-basics&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>Function basics<span class="kw">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The title is auto-inserted from the referenced article. That has the benefit of keeping the right title if the article gets renamed.</p>

<h1 id="interaction-alert-prompt-confirm">Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm</h1>
<p>As we’ll be using the browser as our demo environment, let’s see a couple of functions to interact with the user: <code>alert</code>, <code>prompt</code> and <code>confirm</code>.</p>
<h2 id="alert">alert</h2>
<p>This one we’ve seen already. It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("Hello");</code></p>
<p>The mini-window with the message is called a <em>modal window</em>. The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. In this case – until they press “OK”.</p>
<h2 id="prompt">prompt</h2>
<p>The function <code>prompt</code> accepts two arguments:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify result = prompt(title, [default]);</code></p>
<p>It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>title</code></dt>
<dd>The text to show the visitor.
</dd>
<dt><code>default</code></dt>
<dd>An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>``<code>smart header="The square brackets in syntax</code>[…]<code>" The square brackets around</code>default` in the syntax above denote that the parameter is optional, not required.</p>
<pre><code>
The visitor can type something in the prompt input field and press OK. Then we get that text in the `result`. Or they can cancel the input by pressing Cancel or hitting the `key:Esc` key, then we get `null` as the `result`.

The call to `prompt` returns the text from the input field or `null` if the input was canceled.

For instance:

```js run
let age = prompt(&#39;How old are you?&#39;, 100);

alert(`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old!</code></pre>
<p>```<code>warn header="In IE: always supply a</code>default<code>" The second parameter is optional, but if we don't supply it, Internet Explorer will insert the text</code>“undefined”` into the prompt.</p>
<p>Run this code in Internet Explorer to see:</p>
<p><code>js run let test = prompt("Test");</code></p>
<p>So, for prompts to look good in IE, we recommend always providing the second argument:</p>
<p><code>js run let test = prompt("Test", ""); // &lt;-- for IE</code></p>
<pre><code>
## confirm

The syntax:

```js
result = confirm(question);
```

The function `confirm` shows a modal window with a `question` and two buttons: OK and Cancel.

The result is `true` if OK is pressed and `false` otherwise.

For example:

```js run
let isBoss = confirm(&quot;Are you the boss?&quot;);

alert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed
```

## Summary

We covered 3 browser-specific functions to interact with visitors:

`alert`
: shows a message.

`prompt`
: shows a message asking the user to input text. It returns the text or, if Cancel button or `key:Esc` is clicked, `null`.

`confirm`
: shows a message and waits for the user to press &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;. It returns `true` for OK and `false` for Cancel/`key:Esc`.

All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don&#39;t allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.

There are two limitations shared by all the methods above:

1. The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it&#39;s in the center.
2. The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can&#39;t modify it.

That is the price for simplicity. There are other ways to show nicer windows and richer interaction with the visitor, but if &quot;bells and whistles&quot; do not matter much, these methods work just fine.
# Styles and classes

Before we get into JavaScript&#39;s ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here&#39;s an important rule. Hopefully it&#39;s obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.

There are generally two ways to style an element:

1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `&lt;div class=&quot;...&quot;&gt;`
2. Write properties directly into `style`: `&lt;div style=&quot;...&quot;&gt;`.

JavaScript can modify both classes and `style` properties.

We should always prefer CSS classes to `style`. The latter should only be used if classes &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot;.

For example, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;

elem.style.left = left; // e.g &#39;123px&#39;, calculated at run-time
elem.style.top = top; // e.g &#39;456px&#39;
```

For other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then add the class (JavaScript can do that). That&#39;s more flexible and easier to support.

## className and classList

Changing a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.

In the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `&quot;class&quot;` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `&quot;class&quot;` property, like `elem.class`.

So for classes the similar-looking property `&quot;className&quot;` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `&quot;class&quot;` attribute.

For instance:

```html run
&lt;body class=&quot;main page&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    alert(document.body.className); // main page
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

If we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole string of classes. Sometimes that&#39;s what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.

There&#39;s another property for that: `elem.classList`.

The `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` a single class.

For instance:

```html run
&lt;body class=&quot;main page&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
*!*
    // add a class
    document.body.classList.add(&#39;article&#39;);
*/!*

    alert(document.body.className); // main page article
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

So we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.

Methods of `classList`:

- `elem.classList.add/remove(&quot;class&quot;)` -- adds/removes the class.
- `elem.classList.toggle(&quot;class&quot;)` -- adds the class if it doesn&#39;t exist, otherwise removes it.
- `elem.classList.contains(&quot;class&quot;)` -- checks for the given class, returns `true/false`.

Besides, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes with `for..of`, like this:

```html run
&lt;body class=&quot;main page&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    for (let name of document.body.classList) {
      alert(name); // main, and then page
    }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

## Element style

The property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what&#39;s written in the `&quot;style&quot;` attribute. Setting `elem.style.width=&quot;100px&quot;` works the same as if we had in the attribute `style` a string `width:100px`.

For multi-word property the camelCase is used:

```js no-beautify
background-color  =&gt; elem.style.backgroundColor
z-index           =&gt; elem.style.zIndex
border-left-width =&gt; elem.style.borderLeftWidth
```

For instance:

```js run
document.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt(&#39;background color?&#39;, &#39;green&#39;);
```

````smart header=&quot;Prefixed properties&quot;
Browser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule: a dash means upper case.

For instance:

```js
button.style.MozBorderRadius = &#39;5px&#39;;
button.style.WebkitBorderRadius = &#39;5px&#39;;
```</code></pre>
<h2 id="resetting-the-style-property">Resetting the style property</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to assign a style property, and later remove it.</p>
<p>For instance, to hide an element, we can set <code>elem.style.display = "none"</code>.</p>
<p>Then later we may want to remove the <code>style.display</code> as if it were not set. Instead of <code>delete elem.style.display</code> we should assign an empty string to it: <code>elem.style.display = ""</code>.</p>
```js run // if we run this code, the
<body>
<p>will blink document.body.style.display = “none”; // hide</p>
<p>setTimeout(() =&gt; (document.body.style.display = ""), 1000); // back to normal ```</p>
<p>If we set <code>style.display</code> to an empty string, then the browser applies CSS classes and its built-in styles normally, as if there were no such <code>style.display</code> property at all.</p>
<p>```<code>smart header="Full rewrite with</code>style.cssText<code>" Normally, we use</code>style.*<code>to assign individual style properties. We can't set the full style like</code>div.style=“color: red; width: 100px”<code>, because</code>div.style` is an object, and it’s read-only.</p>
<p>To set the full style as a string, there’s a special property <code>style.cssText</code>:</p>
```html run
<div id="div">
Button
</div>
<script>
  // we can set special style flags like "important" here
  div.style.cssText = `color: red !important;
    background-color: yellow;
    width: 100px;
    text-align: center;
  `;

  alert(div.style.cssText);
</script>
<pre><code>
This property is rarely used, because such assignment removes all existing styles: it does not add, but replaces them. May occasionally delete something needed. But we can safely use it for new elements, when we know we won&#39;t delete an existing style.

The same can be accomplished by setting an attribute: `div.setAttribute(&#39;style&#39;, &#39;color: red...&#39;)`.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mind-the-units">Mind the units</h2>
<p>Don’t forget to add CSS units to values.</p>
<p>For instance, we should not set <code>elem.style.top</code> to <code>10</code>, but rather to <code>10px</code>. Otherwise it wouldn’t work:</p>
```html run height=100
<body>
<script>
  *!*
    // doesn't work!
    document.body.style.margin = 20;
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // '' (empty string, the assignment is ignored)
  */!*

    // now add the CSS unit (px) - and it works
    document.body.style.margin = '20px';
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // 20px

    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // 20px
    alert(document.body.style.marginLeft); // 20px
  </script>
</body>
<p>```</p>
<p>Please note: the browser “unpacks” the property <code>style.margin</code> in the last lines and infers <code>style.marginLeft</code> and <code>style.marginTop</code> from it.</p>
<h2 id="computed-styles-getcomputedstyle">Computed styles: getComputedStyle</h2>
<p>So, modifying a style is easy. But how to <em>read</em> it?</p>
<p>For instance, we want to know the size, margins, the color of an element. How to do it?</p>
<p><strong>The <code>style</code> property operates only on the value of the <code>"style"</code> attribute, without any CSS cascade.</strong></p>
<p>So we can’t read anything that comes from CSS classes using <code>elem.style</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, here <code>style</code> doesn’t see the margin:</p>
```html run height=60 no-beautify
<head>
<style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>
The red text
<script>
*!*
    alert(document.body.style.color); // empty
    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // empty
*/!*
  </script>
</body>
<p>```</p>
<p>…But what if we need, say, to increase the margin by <code>20px</code>? We would want the current value of it.</p>
<p>There’s another method for that: <code>getComputedStyle</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" title="1"><span class="at">getComputedStyle</span>(element<span class="op">,</span> [pseudo])</a></code></pre></div>
<dl>
<dt>element</dt>
<dd>Element to read the value for.
</dd>
<dt>pseudo</dt>
<dd>A pseudo-element if required, for instance <code>::before</code>. An empty string or no argument means the element itself.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The result is an object with styles, like <code>elem.style</code>, but now with respect to all CSS classes.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
```html run height=100
<head>
<style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>
<script>
    let computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.body);

    // now we can read the margin and the color from it

    alert( computedStyle.marginTop ); // 5px
    alert( computedStyle.color ); // rgb(255, 0, 0)
  </script>
</body>
<p>```</p>
<p>```smart header=“Computed and resolved values” There are two concepts in <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#resolved-values">CSS</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <em>computed</em> style value is the value after all CSS rules and CSS inheritance is applied, as the result of the CSS cascade. It can look like <code>height:1em</code> or <code>font-size:125%</code>.</li>
<li>A <em>resolved</em> style value is the one finally applied to the element. Values like <code>1em</code> or <code>125%</code> are relative. The browser takes the computed value and makes all units fixed and absolute, for instance: <code>height:20px</code> or <code>font-size:16px</code>. For geometry properties resolved values may have a floating point, like <code>width:50.5px</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A long time ago <code>getComputedStyle</code> was created to get computed values, but it turned out that resolved values are much more convenient, and the standard changed.</p>
<p>So nowadays <code>getComputedStyle</code> actually returns the resolved value of the property, usually in <code>px</code> for geometry. ```</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="</code>getComputedStyle<code>requires the full property name" We should always ask for the exact property that we want, like</code>paddingLeft<code>or</code>marginTop<code>or</code>borderTopWidth`. Otherwise the correct result is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>For instance, if there are properties <code>paddingLeft/paddingTop</code>, then what should we get for <code>getComputedStyle(elem).padding</code>? Nothing, or maybe a “generated” value from known paddings? There’s no standard rule here.</p>
<p>There are other inconsistencies. As an example, some browsers (Chrome) show <code>10px</code> in the document below, and some of them (Firefox) – do not:</p>
<p><code>html run &lt;style&gt;   body {     margin: 10px;   } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script&gt;   let style = getComputedStyle(document.body);   alert(style.margin); // empty string in Firefox &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<pre><code>
```smart header=&quot;Styles applied to `:visited`links are hidden!&quot; Visited links may be colored using`:visited` CSS pseudoclass.

But `getComputedStyle` does not give access to that color, because otherwise an arbitrary page could find out whether the user visited a link by creating it on the page and checking the styles.

JavaScript may not see the styles applied by `:visited`. And also, there&#39;s a limitation in CSS that forbids applying geometry-changing styles in `:visited`. That&#39;s to guarantee that there&#39;s no side way for an evil page to test if a link was visited and hence to break the privacy.

````

## Summary

To manage classes, there are two DOM properties:

- `className` -- the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.
- `classList` -- the object with methods `add/remove/toggle/contains`, good for individual classes.

To change the styles:

- The `style` property is an object with camelCased styles. Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying individual properties in the `&quot;style&quot;` attribute. To see how to apply `important` and other rare stuff -- there&#39;s a list of methods at [MDN](mdn:api/CSSStyleDeclaration).

- The `style.cssText` property corresponds to the whole `&quot;style&quot;` attribute, the full string of styles.

To read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):

- The `getComputedStyle(elem, [pseudo])` returns the style-like object with them. Read-only.
# Element size and scrolling

There are many JavaScript properties that allow us to read information about element width, height and other geometry features.

We often need them when moving or positioning elements in JavaScript.

## Sample element

As a sample element to demonstrate properties we&#39;ll use the one given below:

```html no-beautify
&lt;div id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
  ...Text...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
  #example {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 25px solid #E8C48F;
    padding: 20px;
    overflow: auto;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
````

It has the border, padding and scrolling. The full set of features. There are no margins, as they are not the part of the element itself, and there are no special properties for them.

The element looks like this:

![](metric-css.svg)

You can [open the document in the sandbox](sandbox:metric).

```smart header=&quot;Mind the scrollbar&quot;
The picture above demonstrates the most complex case when the element has a scrollbar. Some browsers (not all) reserve the space for it by taking it from the content (labeled as &quot;content width&quot; above).

So, without scrollbar the content width would be `300px`, but if the scrollbar is `16px` wide (the width may vary between devices and browsers) then only `300 - 16 = 284px` remains, and we should take it into account. That&#39;s why examples from this chapter assume that there&#39;s a scrollbar. Without it, some calculations are simpler.
```

```smart header=&quot;The `padding-bottom`area may be filled with text&quot; Usually paddings are shown empty on our illustrations, but if there&#39;s a lot of text in the element and it overflows, then browsers show the &quot;overflowing&quot; text at`padding-bottom`, that&#39;s normal.

````

## Geometry

Here&#39;s the overall picture with geometry properties:

![](metric-all.svg)

Values of these properties are technically numbers, but these numbers are &quot;of pixels&quot;, so these are pixel measurements.

Let&#39;s start exploring the properties starting from the outside of the element.

## offsetParent, offsetLeft/Top

These properties are rarely needed, but still they are the &quot;most outer&quot; geometry properties, so we&#39;ll start with them.

The `offsetParent` is the nearest ancestor that the browser uses for calculating coordinates during rendering.

That&#39;s the nearest ancestor that is one of the following:

1. CSS-positioned (`position` is `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed` or `sticky`),  or
2. `&lt;td&gt;`, `&lt;th&gt;`, or `&lt;table&gt;`,  or
3. `&lt;body&gt;`.

Properties `offsetLeft/offsetTop` provide x/y coordinates relative to `offsetParent` upper-left corner.

In the example below the inner `&lt;div&gt;` has `&lt;main&gt;` as `offsetParent` and `offsetLeft/offsetTop` shifts from its upper-left corner (`180`):

```html run height=10
&lt;main style=&quot;position: relative&quot; id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
  &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;example&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 180px; top: 180px&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  alert(example.offsetParent.id); // main
  alert(example.offsetLeft); // 180 (note: a number, not a string &quot;180px&quot;)
  alert(example.offsetTop); // 180
&lt;/script&gt;
````

![](metric-offset-parent.svg)

There are several occasions when `offsetParent` is `null`:

1. For not shown elements (`display:none` or not in the document).
2. For `&lt;body&gt;` and `&lt;html&gt;`.
3. For elements with `position:fixed`.

## offsetWidth/Height

Now let&#39;s move on to the element itself.

These two properties are the simplest ones. They provide the &quot;outer&quot; width/height of the element. Or, in other words, its full size including borders.

![](metric-offset-width-height.svg)

For our sample element:

- `offsetWidth = 390` -- the outer width, can be calculated as inner CSS-width (`300px`) plus paddings (`2 * 20px`) and borders (`2 * 25px`).
- `offsetHeight = 290` -- the outer height.

````smart header=&quot;Geometry properties are zero/null for elements that are not displayed&quot;
Geometry properties are calculated only for displayed elements.

If an element (or any of its ancestors) has `display:none` or is not in the document, then all geometry properties are zero (or `null` for `offsetParent`).

For example, `offsetParent` is `null`, and `offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight` are `0` when we created an element, but haven&#39;t inserted it into the document yet, or it (or it&#39;s ancestor) has `display:none`.

We can use this to check if an element is hidden, like this:

```js
function isHidden(elem) {
  return !elem.offsetWidth &amp;&amp; !elem.offsetHeight;
}
```

Please note that such `isHidden` returns `true` for elements that are on-screen, but have zero sizes (like an empty `&lt;div&gt;`).
````

## clientTop/Left

Inside the element we have the borders.

To measure them, there are properties `clientTop` and `clientLeft`.

In our example:

- `clientLeft = 25` -- left border width
- `clientTop = 25` -- top border width

![](metric-client-left-top.svg)

...But to be precise -- these properties are not border width/height, but rather relative coordinates of the inner side from the outer side.

What&#39;s the difference?

It becomes visible when the document is right-to-left (the operating system is in Arabic or Hebrew languages). The scrollbar is then not on the right, but on the left, and then `clientLeft` also includes the scrollbar width.

In that case, `clientLeft` would be not `25`, but with the scrollbar width `25 + 16 = 41`.

Here&#39;s the example in hebrew:

![](metric-client-left-top-rtl.svg)

## clientWidth/Height

These properties provide the size of the area inside the element borders.

They include the content width together with paddings, but without the scrollbar:

![](metric-client-width-height.svg)

On the picture above let&#39;s first consider `clientHeight`.

There&#39;s no horizontal scrollbar, so it&#39;s exactly the sum of what&#39;s inside the borders: CSS-height `200px` plus top and bottom paddings (`2 * 20px`) total `240px`.

Now `clientWidth` -- here the content width is not `300px`, but `284px`, because `16px` are occupied by the scrollbar. So the sum is `284px` plus left and right paddings, total `324px`.

**If there are no paddings, then `clientWidth/Height` is exactly the content area, inside the borders and the scrollbar (if any).**

![](metric-client-width-nopadding.svg)

So when there&#39;s no padding we can use `clientWidth/clientHeight` to get the content area size.

## scrollWidth/Height

These properties are like `clientWidth/clientHeight`, but they also include the scrolled out (hidden) parts:

![](metric-scroll-width-height.svg)

On the picture above:

- `scrollHeight = 723` -- is the full inner height of the content area including the scrolled out parts.
- `scrollWidth = 324` -- is the full inner width, here we have no horizontal scroll, so it equals `clientWidth`.

We can use these properties to expand the element wide to its full width/height.

Like this:

```js
// expand the element to the full content height
element.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`;
```

```online
Click the button to expand the element:

&lt;div id=&quot;element&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;height:200px; padding: 0;overflow: auto; border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;button style=&quot;padding:0&quot; onclick=&quot;element.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`&quot;&gt;element.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`&lt;/button&gt;
```

## scrollLeft/scrollTop

Properties `scrollLeft/scrollTop` are the width/height of the hidden, scrolled out part of the element.

On the picture below we can see `scrollHeight` and `scrollTop` for a block with a vertical scroll.

![](metric-scroll-top.svg)

In other words, `scrollTop` is &quot;how much is scrolled up&quot;.

````smart header=&quot;`scrollLeft/scrollTop`can be modified&quot; Most of the geometry properties here are read-only, but`scrollLeft/scrollTop` can be changed, and the browser will scroll the element.

```online
If you click the element below, the code `elem.scrollTop += 10` executes. That makes the element content scroll `10px` down.

&lt;div onclick=&quot;this.scrollTop+=10&quot; style=&quot;cursor:pointer;border:1px solid black;width:100px;height:80px;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;Click&lt;br&gt;Me&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;4&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;6&lt;br&gt;7&lt;br&gt;8&lt;br&gt;9&lt;/div&gt;
```

Setting `scrollTop` to `0` or a big value, such as `1e9` will make the element scroll to the very top/bottom respectively.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dont-take-widthheight-from-css">Don’t take width/height from CSS</h2>
<p>We’ve just covered geometry properties of DOM elements, that can be used to get widths, heights and calculate distances.</p>
<p>But as we know from the chapter <a href="info:styles-and-classes" class="uri">info:styles-and-classes</a>, we can read CSS-height and width using <code>getComputedStyle</code>.</p>
<p>So why not to read the width of an element with <code>getComputedStyle</code>, like this?</p>
<p>```js run let elem = document.body;</p>
<p>alert( getComputedStyle(elem).width ); // show CSS width for elem ```</p>
<p>Why should we use geometry properties instead? There are two reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, CSS <code>width/height</code> depend on another property: <code>box-sizing</code> that defines “what is” CSS width and height. A change in <code>box-sizing</code> for CSS purposes may break such JavaScript.</li>
<li><p>Second, CSS <code>width/height</code> may be <code>auto</code>, for instance for an inline element:</p>
<p>```html run <span id="elem">Hello!</span></p>
<script>
 *!*
   alert( getComputedStyle(elem).width ); // auto
 */!*
 </script>
<p>```</p>
<p>From the CSS standpoint, <code>width:auto</code> is perfectly normal, but in JavaScript we need an exact size in <code>px</code> that we can use in calculations. So here CSS width is useless.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And there’s one more reason: a scrollbar. Sometimes the code that works fine without a scrollbar becomes buggy with it, because a scrollbar takes the space from the content in some browsers. So the real width available for the content is <em>less</em> than CSS width. And <code>clientWidth/clientHeight</code> take that into account.</p>
<p>…But with <code>getComputedStyle(elem).width</code> the situation is different. Some browsers (e.g. Chrome) return the real inner width, minus the scrollbar, and some of them (e.g. Firefox) – CSS width (ignore the scrollbar). Such cross-browser differences is the reason not to use <code>getComputedStyle</code>, but rather rely on geometry properties.</p>
<pre class="online"><code>If your browser reserves the space for a scrollbar (most browsers for Windows do), then you can test it below.

[iframe src=&quot;cssWidthScroll&quot; link border=1]

The element with text has CSS `width:300px`.

On a Desktop Windows OS, Firefox, Chrome, Edge all reserve the space for the scrollbar. But  Firefox shows `300px`, while Chrome and Edge show less. That&#39;s because Firefox returns the CSS width and other browsers return the &quot;real&quot; width.</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the described difference is only about reading <code>getComputedStyle(...).width</code> from JavaScript, visually everything is correct.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Elements have the following geometry properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>offsetParent</code> – is the nearest positioned ancestor or <code>td</code>, <code>th</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>body</code>.</li>
<li><code>offsetLeft/offsetTop</code> – coordinates relative to the upper-left edge of <code>offsetParent</code>.</li>
<li><code>offsetWidth/offsetHeight</code> – “outer” width/height of an element including borders.</li>
<li><code>clientLeft/clientTop</code> – the distances from the upper-left outer corner to the upper-left inner (content + padding) corner. For left-to-right OS they are always the widths of left/top borders. For right-to-left OS the vertical scrollbar is on the left so <code>clientLeft</code> includes its width too.</li>
<li><code>clientWidth/clientHeight</code> – the width/height of the content including paddings, but without the scrollbar.</li>
<li><code>scrollWidth/scrollHeight</code> – the width/height of the content, just like <code>clientWidth/clientHeight</code>, but also include scrolled-out, invisible part of the element.</li>
<li><code>scrollLeft/scrollTop</code> – width/height of the scrolled out upper part of the element, starting from its upper-left corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>All properties are read-only except <code>scrollLeft/scrollTop</code> that make the browser scroll the element if changed. # Window sizes and scrolling</p>
<p>How do we find the width and height of the browser window? How do we get the full width and height of the document, including the scrolled out part? How do we scroll the page using JavaScript?</p>
<p>For this type of information, we can use the root document element <code>document.documentElement</code>, that corresponds to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. But there are additional methods and peculiarities to consider.</p>
<h2 id="widthheight-of-the-window">Width/height of the window</h2>
<p>To get window width and height, we can use the <code>clientWidth/clientHeight</code> of <code>document.documentElement</code>:</p>
<p><img src="document-client-width-height.svg" /></p>
<pre class="online"><code>For instance, this button shows the height of your window:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert(document.documentElement.clientHeight)&quot;&gt;alert(document.documentElement.clientHeight)&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>```<code>warn header="Not</code>window.innerWidth/innerHeight<code>" Browsers also support properties like</code>window.innerWidth/innerHeight`. They look like what we want, so why not to use them instead?</p>
<p>If there exists a scrollbar, and it occupies some space, <code>clientWidth/clientHeight</code> provide the width/height without it (subtract it). In other words, they return the width/height of the visible part of the document, available for the content.</p>
<p><code>window.innerWidth/innerHeight</code> includes the scrollbar.</p>
<p>If there’s a scrollbar, and it occupies some space, then these two lines show different values: <code>js run alert( window.innerWidth ); // full window width alert( document.documentElement.clientWidth ); // window width minus the scrollbar</code></p>
<p>In most cases, we need the <em>available</em> window width in order to draw or position something within scrollbars (if there are any), so we should use <code>documentElement.clientHeight/clientWidth</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
```warn header=&quot;`DOCTYPE`is important&quot; Please note: top-level geometry properties may work a little bit differently when there&#39;s no`&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;` in HTML. Odd things are possible.

In modern HTML we should always write `DOCTYPE`.

````

## Width/height of the document

Theoretically, as the root document element is `document.documentElement`, and it encloses all the content, we could measure the document&#39;s full size as `document.documentElement.scrollWidth/scrollHeight`.

But on that element, for the whole page, these properties do not work as intended. In Chrome/Safari/Opera, if there&#39;s no scroll, then `documentElement.scrollHeight` may be even less than `documentElement.clientHeight`! Weird, right?

To reliably obtain the full document height, we should take the maximum of these properties:

```js run
let scrollHeight = Math.max(
  document.body.scrollHeight, document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
  document.body.offsetHeight, document.documentElement.offsetHeight,
  document.body.clientHeight, document.documentElement.clientHeight
);

alert(&#39;Full document height, with scrolled out part: &#39; + scrollHeight);
````

Why so? Better don&#39;t ask. These inconsistencies come from ancient times, not a &quot;smart&quot; logic.

## Get the current scroll [#page-scroll]

DOM elements have their current scroll state in their `scrollLeft/scrollTop` properties.

For document scroll, `document.documentElement.scrollLeft/scrollTop` works in most browsers, except older WebKit-based ones, like Safari (bug [5991](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5991)), where we should use `document.body` instead of `document.documentElement`.

Luckily, we don&#39;t have to remember these peculiarities at all, because the scroll is available in the special properties, `window.pageXOffset/pageYOffset`:

```js run
alert(&quot;Current scroll from the top: &quot; + window.pageYOffset);
alert(&quot;Current scroll from the left: &quot; + window.pageXOffset);
```

These properties are read-only.

```smart header=&quot;Also available as `window`properties`scrollX`and`scrollY`&quot;
For historical reasons, both properties exist, but they are the same:

- `window.pageXOffset` is an alias of `window.scrollX`.
- `window.pageYOffset` is an alias of `window.scrollY`.

## Scrolling: scrollTo, scrollBy, scrollIntoView [#window-scroll]

```warn
To scroll the page with JavaScript, its DOM must be fully built.

For instance, if we try to scroll the page with a script in `&lt;head&gt;`, it won&#39;t work.
````

Regular elements can be scrolled by changing `scrollTop/scrollLeft`.

We can do the same for the page using `document.documentElement.scrollTop/scrollLeft` (except Safari, where `document.body.scrollTop/Left` should be used instead).

Alternatively, there&#39;s a simpler, universal solution: special methods [window.scrollBy(x,y)](mdn:api/Window/scrollBy) and [window.scrollTo(pageX,pageY)](mdn:api/Window/scrollTo).

- The method `scrollBy(x,y)` scrolls the page _relative to its current position_. For instance, `scrollBy(0,10)` scrolls the page `10px` down.

  ```online
  The button below demonstrates this:

  &lt;button onclick=&quot;window.scrollBy(0,10)&quot;&gt;window.scrollBy(0,10)&lt;/button&gt;
  ```

- The method `scrollTo(pageX,pageY)` scrolls the page _to absolute coordinates_, so that the top-left corner of the visible part has coordinates `(pageX, pageY)` relative to the document&#39;s top-left corner. It&#39;s like setting `scrollLeft/scrollTop`.

  To scroll to the very beginning, we can use `scrollTo(0,0)`.

  ```online
  &lt;button onclick=&quot;window.scrollTo(0,0)&quot;&gt;window.scrollTo(0,0)&lt;/button&gt;
  ```

These methods work for all browsers the same way.

## scrollIntoView

For completeness, let&#39;s cover one more method: [elem.scrollIntoView(top)](mdn:api/Element/scrollIntoView).

The call to `elem.scrollIntoView(top)` scrolls the page to make `elem` visible. It has one argument:

- If `top=true` (that&#39;s the default), then the page will be scrolled to make `elem` appear on the top of the window. The upper edge of the element will be aligned with the window top.
- If `top=false`, then the page scrolls to make `elem` appear at the bottom. The bottom edge of the element will be aligned with the window bottom.

```online
The button below scrolls the page to position itself at the window top:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;this.scrollIntoView()&quot;&gt;this.scrollIntoView()&lt;/button&gt;

And this button scrolls the page to position itself at the bottom:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;this.scrollIntoView(false)&quot;&gt;this.scrollIntoView(false)&lt;/button&gt;
```

## Forbid the scrolling

Sometimes we need to make the document &quot;unscrollable&quot;. For instance, when we need to cover the page with a large message requiring immediate attention, and we want the visitor to interact with that message, not with the document.

To make the document unscrollable, it&#39;s enough to set `document.body.style.overflow = &quot;hidden&quot;`. The page will &quot;freeze&quot; at its current scroll position.

```online
Try it:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;document.body.style.overflow = &#39;hidden&#39;&quot;&gt;document.body.style.overflow = &#39;hidden&#39;&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;button onclick=&quot;document.body.style.overflow = &#39;&#39;&quot;&gt;document.body.style.overflow = &#39;&#39;&lt;/button&gt;

The first button freezes the scroll, while the second one releases it.
```

We can use the same technique to freeze the scroll for other elements, not just for `document.body`.

The drawback of the method is that the scrollbar disappears. If it occupied some space, then that space is now free and the content &quot;jumps&quot; to fill it.

That looks a bit odd, but can be worked around if we compare `clientWidth` before and after the freeze. If it increased (the scrollbar disappeared), then add `padding` to `document.body` in place of the scrollbar to keep the content width the same.

## Summary

Geometry:

- Width/height of the visible part of the document (content area width/height): `document.documentElement.clientWidth/clientHeight`
- Width/height of the whole document, with the scrolled out part:

  ```js
  let scrollHeight = Math.max(
    document.body.scrollHeight,
    document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
    document.body.offsetHeight,
    document.documentElement.offsetHeight,
    document.body.clientHeight,
    document.documentElement.clientHeight
  );
  ```

Scrolling:

- Read the current scroll: `window.pageYOffset/pageXOffset`.
- Change the current scroll:

  - `window.scrollTo(pageX,pageY)` -- absolute coordinates,
  - `window.scrollBy(x,y)` -- scroll relative the current place,
  - `elem.scrollIntoView(top)` -- scroll to make `elem` visible (align with the top/bottom of the window).

# Coordinates

To move elements around we should be familiar with coordinates.

Most JavaScript methods deal with one of two coordinate systems:

1. **Relative to the window** - similar to `position:fixed`, calculated from the window top/left edge.
   - we&#39;ll denote these coordinates as `clientX/clientY`, the reasoning for such name will become clear later, when we study event properties.
2. **Relative to the document** - similar to `position:absolute` in the document root, calculated from the document top/left edge.
   - we&#39;ll denote them `pageX/pageY`.

When the page is scrolled to the very beginning, so that the top/left corner of the window is exactly the document top/left corner, these coordinates equal each other. But after the document shifts, window-relative coordinates of elements change, as elements move across the window, while document-relative coordinates remain the same.

On this picture we take a point in the document and demonstrate its coordinates before the scroll (left) and after it (right):

![](document-and-window-coordinates-scrolled.svg)

When the document scrolled:

- `pageY` - document-relative coordinate stayed the same, it&#39;s counted from the document top (now scrolled out).
- `clientY` - window-relative coordinate did change (the arrow became shorter), as the same point became closer to window top.

## Element coordinates: getBoundingClientRect

The method `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` returns window coordinates for a minimal rectangle that encloses `elem` as an object of built-in [DOMRect](https://www.w3.org/TR/geometry-1/#domrect) class.

Main `DOMRect` properties:

- `x/y` -- X/Y-coordinates of the rectangle origin relative to window,
- `width/height` -- width/height of the rectangle (can be negative).

Additionally, there are derived properties:

- `top/bottom` -- Y-coordinate for the top/bottom rectangle edge,
- `left/right` -- X-coordinate for the left/right rectangle edge.

```online
For instance click this button to see its window coordinates:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;brTest&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Get coordinates using button.getBoundingClientRect() for this button&quot; onclick=&#39;showRect(this)&#39;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
function showRect(elem) {
  let r = elem.getBoundingClientRect();
  alert(`x:${r.x}
y:${r.y}
width:${r.width}
height:${r.height}
top:${r.top}
bottom:${r.bottom}
left:${r.left}
right:${r.right}
`);
}
&lt;/script&gt;

If you scroll the page and repeat, you&#39;ll notice that as window-relative button position changes, its window coordinates (`y/top/bottom` if you scroll vertically) change as well.
```

Here&#39;s the picture of `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` output:

![](coordinates.svg)

As you can see, `x/y` and `width/height` fully describe the rectangle. Derived properties can be easily calculated from them:

- `left = x`
- `top = y`
- `right = x + width`
- `bottom = y + height`

Please note:

- Coordinates may be decimal fractions, such as `10.5`. That&#39;s normal, internally browser uses fractions in calculations. We don&#39;t have to round them when setting to `style.left/top`.
- Coordinates may be negative. For instance, if the page is scrolled so that `elem` is now above the window, then `elem.getBoundingClientRect().top` is negative.

```smart header=&quot;Why derived properties are needed? Why does `top/left`exist if there&#39;s`x/y`?&quot; Mathematically, a rectangle is uniquely defined with its starting point `(x,y)`and the direction vector`(width,height)`. So the additional derived properties are for convenience.

Technically it&#39;s possible for `width/height` to be negative, that allows for &quot;directed&quot; rectangle, e.g. to represent mouse selection with properly marked start and end.

Negative `width/height` values mean that the rectangle starts at its bottom-right corner and then &quot;grows&quot; left-upwards.

Here&#39;s a rectangle with negative `width` and `height` (e.g. `width=-200`, `height=-100`):

![](coordinates-negative.svg)

As you can see, `left/top` do not equal `x/y` in such case.

In practice though, `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` always returns positive width/height, here we mention negative `width/height` only for you to understand why these seemingly duplicate properties are not actually duplicates.

````

```warn header=&quot;Internet Explorer: no support for `x/y`&quot;
Internet Explorer doesn&#39;t support `x/y` properties for historical reasons.

So we can either make a polyfill (add getters in `DomRect.prototype`) or just use `top/left`, as they are always the same as `x/y` for positive `width/height`, in particular in the result of `elem.getBoundingClientRect()`.
````

```warn header=&quot;Coordinates right/bottom are different from CSS position properties&quot;
There are obvious similarities between window-relative coordinates and CSS `position:fixed`.

But in CSS positioning, `right` property means the distance from the right edge, and `bottom` property means the distance from the bottom edge.

If we just look at the picture above, we can see that in JavaScript it is not so. All window coordinates are counted from the top-left corner, including these ones.
```

## elementFromPoint(x, y) [#elementFromPoint]

The call to `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` returns the most nested element at window coordinates `(x, y)`.

The syntax is:

```js
let elem = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
```

For instance, the code below highlights and outputs the tag of the element that is now in the middle of the window:

```js run
let centerX = document.documentElement.clientWidth / 2;
let centerY = document.documentElement.clientHeight / 2;

let elem = document.elementFromPoint(centerX, centerY);

elem.style.background = &quot;red&quot;;
alert(elem.tagName);
```

As it uses window coordinates, the element may be different depending on the current scroll position.

````warn header=&quot;For out-of-window coordinates the `elementFromPoint`returns`null`&quot; The method `document.elementFromPoint(x,y)`only works if`(x,y)` are inside the visible area.

If any of the coordinates is negative or exceeds the window width/height, then it returns `null`.

Here&#39;s a typical error that may occur if we don&#39;t check for it:

```js
let elem = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
// if the coordinates happen to be out of the window, then elem = null
*!*
elem.style.background = &#39;&#39;; // Error!
*/!*
```

<p>The reason is obvious: the message element relies on <code>position:fixed</code>, so it remains at the same place of the window while the page scrolls away.</p>

<p>We can use <code>position:absolute</code> and <code>top/left</code> to put something at a certain place of the document, so that it remains there during a page scroll. But we need the right coordinates first.</p>

<p><em>An event</em> is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals (but events are not limited to DOM).</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the most useful DOM events, just to take a look at:</p>
<p><strong>Mouse events:</strong> - <code>click</code> – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap). - <code>contextmenu</code> – when the mouse right-clicks on an element. - <code>mouseover</code> / <code>mouseout</code> – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element. - <code>mousedown</code> / <code>mouseup</code> – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element. - <code>mousemove</code> – when the mouse is moved.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard events:</strong> - <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.</p>
<p><strong>Form element events:</strong> - <code>submit</code> – when the visitor submits a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>. - <code>focus</code> – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Document events:</strong> - <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.</p>
<p><strong>CSS events:</strong> - <code>transitionend</code> – when a CSS-animation finishes.</p>
<p>There are many other events. We’ll get into more details of particular events in next chapters.</p>
<h2 id="event-handlers">Event handlers</h2>
<p>To react on events we can assign a <em>handler</em> – a function that runs in case of an event.</p>
<p>Handlers are a way to run JavaScript code in case of user actions.</p>
<p>There are several ways to assign a handler. Let’s see them, starting from the simplest one.</p>
<h3 id="html-attribute">HTML-attribute</h3>
<p>A handler can be set in HTML with an attribute named <code>on&lt;event&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, to assign a <code>click</code> handler for an <code>input</code>, we can use <code>onclick</code>, like here:</p>
<p><code>html run &lt;input value="Click me" *!*onclick="alert('Click!')"*/!* type="button"&gt;</code></p>
<p>On mouse click, the code inside <code>onclick</code> runs.</p>
<p>Please note that inside <code>onclick</code> we use single quotes, because the attribute itself is in double quotes. If we forget that the code is inside the attribute and use double quotes inside, like this: <code>onclick="alert("Click!")"</code>, then it won’t work right.</p>
<p>An HTML-attribute is not a convenient place to write a lot of code, so we’d better create a JavaScript function and call it there.</p>
<p>Here a click runs the function <code>countRabbits()</code>:</p>
```html autorun height=50
<script>
  function countRabbits() {
    for(let i=1; i<=3; i++) {
      alert("Rabbit number " + i);
    }
  }
</script>
<p>&lt;input type=“button” <em>!</em>onclick=“countRabbits()”<em>/!</em> value=“Count rabbits!”&gt; ```</p>
<p>As we know, HTML attribute names are not case-sensitive, so <code>ONCLICK</code> works as well as <code>onClick</code> and <code>onCLICK</code>… But usually attributes are lowercased: <code>onclick</code>.</p>
<h3 id="dom-property">DOM property</h3>
<p>We can assign a handler using a DOM property <code>on&lt;event&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>elem.onclick</code>:</p>
<p><code>html autorun &lt;input id="elem" type="button" value="Click me"&gt; &lt;script&gt; *!*   elem.onclick = function() {     alert('Thank you');   }; */!* &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>If the handler is assigned using an HTML-attribute then the browser reads it, creates a new function from the attribute content and writes it to the DOM property.</p>
<p>So this way is actually the same as the previous one.</p>
<p>These two code pieces work the same:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Only HTML:</p>

<li><p>HTML + JS:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=50  &lt;input type="button" id="button" value="Button"&gt;  &lt;script&gt;  *!*    button.onclick = function() {      alert('Click!');    };  */!*  &lt;/script&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first example, the HTML attribute is used to initialize the <code>button.onclick</code>, while in the second example – the script, that’s all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>As there’s only one <code>onclick</code> property, we can’t assign more than one event handler.</strong></p>
<p>In the example below adding a handler with JavaScript overwrites the existing handler:</p>
<p><code>html run height=50 autorun &lt;input type="button" id="elem" onclick="alert('Before')" value="Click me"&gt; &lt;script&gt; *!*   elem.onclick = function() { // overwrites the existing handler     alert('After'); // only this will be shown   }; */!* &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>To remove a handler – assign <code>elem.onclick = null</code>.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-the-element-this">Accessing the element: this</h2>
<p>The value of <code>this</code> inside a handler is the element. The one which has the handler on it.</p>
<p>In the code below <code>button</code> shows its contents using <code>this.innerHTML</code>:</p>
<p><code>html height=50 autorun &lt;button onclick="alert(this.innerHTML)"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="possible-mistakes">Possible mistakes</h2>
<p>If you’re starting to work with events – please note some subtleties.</p>
<p>We can set an existing function as a handler:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">sayThanks</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-2" title="2">  <span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Thanks!&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-5" title="5"><span class="va">elem</span>.<span class="at">onclick</span> <span class="op">=</span> sayThanks<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>But be careful: the function should be assigned as <code>sayThanks</code>, not <code>sayThanks()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" title="1"><span class="co">// right</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-2" title="2"><span class="va">button</span>.<span class="at">onclick</span> <span class="op">=</span> sayThanks<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-4" title="4"><span class="co">// wrong</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-5" title="5"><span class="va">button</span>.<span class="at">onclick</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">sayThanks</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we add parentheses, then <code>sayThanks()</code> becomes is a function call. So the last line actually takes the <em>result</em> of the function execution, that is <code>undefined</code> (as the function returns nothing), and assigns it to <code>onclick</code>. That doesn’t work.</p>
<p>…On the other hand, in the markup we do need the parentheses:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;input</span><span class="ot"> type=</span><span class="st">&quot;button&quot;</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;button&quot;</span><span class="ot"> onclick=</span><span class="st">&quot;sayThanks()&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The difference is easy to explain. When the browser reads the attribute, it creates a handler function with body from the attribute content.</p>
<p>So the markup generates this property:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-1" title="1"><span class="va">button</span>.<span class="at">onclick</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-2" title="2"><span class="op">*!*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-3" title="3">  <span class="at">sayThanks</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &lt;-- the attribute content goes here</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-4" title="4"><span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-5" title="5"><span class="ss">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Don’t use <code>setAttribute</code> for handlers.</strong></p>
<p>Such a call won’t work:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify // a click on &lt;body&gt; will generate errors, // because attributes are always strings, function becomes a string document.body.setAttribute('onclick', function() { alert(1) });</code></p>
<p><strong>DOM-property case matters.</strong></p>
<p>Assign a handler to <code>elem.onclick</code>, not <code>elem.ONCLICK</code>, because DOM properties are case-sensitive.</p>
<h2 id="addeventlistener">addEventListener</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem of the aforementioned ways to assign handlers – we can’t assign multiple handlers to one event.</p>
<p>Let’s say, one part of our code wants to highlight a button on click, and another one wants to show a message on the same click.</p>
<p>We’d like to assign two event handlers for that. But a new DOM property will overwrite the existing one:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify input.onclick = function() { alert(1); } // ... input.onclick = function() { alert(2); } // replaces the previous handler</code></p>
<p>Developers of web standards understood that long ago and suggested an alternative way of managing handlers using special methods <code>addEventListener</code> and <code>removeEventListener</code>. They are free of such a problem.</p>
<p>The syntax to add a handler:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" title="1"><span class="va">element</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>(event<span class="op">,</span> handler<span class="op">,</span> [options])<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<dl>
<dt><code>event</code></dt>
<dd>Event name, e.g. <code>"click"</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>handler</code></dt>
<dd>The handler function.
</dd>
<dt><code>options</code></dt>
<dd>An additional optional object with properties: - <code>once</code>: if <code>true</code>, then the listener is automatically removed after it triggers. - <code>capture</code>: the phase where to handle the event, to be covered later in the chapter <a href="info:bubbling-and-capturing" class="uri">info:bubbling-and-capturing</a>. For historical reasons, <code>options</code> can also be <code>false/true</code>, that’s the same as <code>{capture: false/true}</code>. - <code>passive</code>: if <code>true</code>, then the handler will not call <code>preventDefault()</code>, we’ll explain that later in <a href="info:default-browser-action" class="uri">info:default-browser-action</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To remove the handler, use <code>removeEventListener</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-1" title="1"><span class="va">element</span>.<span class="at">removeEventListener</span>(event<span class="op">,</span> handler<span class="op">,</span> [options])<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>````warn header=“Removal requires the same function” To remove a handler we should pass exactly the same function as was assigned.</p>
<p>This doesn’t work:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify elem.addEventListener( "click" , () =&gt; alert('Thanks!')); // .... elem.removeEventListener( "click", () =&gt; alert('Thanks!'));</code></p>
<p>The handler won’t be removed, because <code>removeEventListener</code> gets another function – with the same code, but that doesn’t matter, as it’s a different function object.</p>
<p>Here’s the right way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">handler</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-2" title="2">  <span class="at">alert</span>( <span class="st">&#39;Thanks!&#39;</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-5" title="5"><span class="va">input</span>.<span class="at">addEventListener</span>(<span class="st">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> handler)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-7" title="7"><span class="va">input</span>.<span class="at">removeEventListener</span>(<span class="st">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> handler)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Please note – if we don’t store the function in a variable, then we can’t remove it. There’s no way to “read back” handlers assigned by <code>addEventListener</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
Multiple calls to `addEventListener` allow to add multiple handlers, like this:

```html run no-beautify
&lt;input id=&quot;elem&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Click me&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    function handler1() {
      alert(&#39;Thanks!&#39;);
    };

    function handler2() {
      alert(&#39;Thanks again!&#39;);
    }

  *!*
    elem.onclick = () =&gt; alert(&quot;Hello&quot;);
    elem.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, handler1); // Thanks!
    elem.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, handler2); // Thanks again!
  */!*
&lt;/script&gt;
```

As we can see in the example above, we can set handlers _both_ using a DOM-property and `addEventListener`. But generally we use only one of these ways.

````warn header=&quot;For some events, handlers only work with `addEventListener`&quot; There exist events that can&#39;t be assigned via a DOM-property. Only with `addEventListener`.

For instance, the `DOMContentLoaded` event, that triggers when the document is loaded and DOM is built.

```js
// will never run
document.onDOMContentLoaded = function () {
  alert(&quot;DOM built&quot;);
};
```

```js
// this way it works
document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function () {
  alert(&quot;DOM built&quot;);
});
```

So `addEventListener` is more universal. Although, such events are an exception rather than the rule.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="event-object">Event object</h2>
<p>To properly handle an event we’d want to know more about what’s happened. Not just a “click” or a “keydown”, but what were the pointer coordinates? Which key was pressed? And so on.</p>
<p>When an event happens, the browser creates an <em>event object</em>, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of getting pointer coordinates from the event object:</p>
<p>```html run <input type="button" value="Click me" id="elem"></p>
<script>
  elem.onclick = function(*!*event*/!*) {
    // show event type, element and coordinates of the click
    alert(event.type + " at " + event.currentTarget);
    alert("Coordinates: " + event.clientX + ":" + event.clientY);
  };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Some properties of <code>event</code> object:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>event.type</code></dt>
<dd>Event type, here it’s <code>"click"</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>event.currentTarget</code></dt>
<dd>Element that handled the event. That’s exactly the same as <code>this</code>, unless the handler is an arrow function, or its <code>this</code> is bound to something else, then we can get the element from <code>event.currentTarget</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>event.clientX / event.clientY</code></dt>
<dd>Window-relative coordinates of the cursor, for pointer events.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are more properties. Many of them depend on the event type: keyboard events have one set of properties, pointer events - another one, we’ll study them later when we come to different events in details.</p>
<p>```<code>smart header="The event object is also available in HTML handlers" If we assign a handler in HTML, we can also use the</code>event` object, like this:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=60 &lt;input type="button" onclick="*!*alert(event.type)*/!*" value="Event type"&gt;</code></p>
<p>That’s possible because when the browser reads the attribute, it creates a handler like this: <code>function(event) { alert(event.type) }</code>. That is: its first argument is called <code>"event"</code>, and the body is taken from the attribute.</p>
<pre><code>
## Object handlers: handleEvent

We can assign not just a function, but an object as an event handler using `addEventListener`. When an event occurs, its `handleEvent` method is called.

For instance:

```html run
&lt;button id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let obj = {
    handleEvent(event) {
      alert(event.type + &quot; at &quot; + event.currentTarget);
    },
  };

  elem.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, obj);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

As we can see, when `addEventListener` receives an object as the handler, it calls `obj.handleEvent(event)` in case of an event.

We could also use a class for that:

```html run
&lt;button id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    class Menu {
      handleEvent(event) {
        switch(event.type) {
          case &#39;mousedown&#39;:
            elem.innerHTML = &quot;Mouse button pressed&quot;;
            break;
          case &#39;mouseup&#39;:
            elem.innerHTML += &quot;...and released.&quot;;
            break;
        }
      }
    }

  *!*
    let menu = new Menu();
    elem.addEventListener(&#39;mousedown&#39;, menu);
    elem.addEventListener(&#39;mouseup&#39;, menu);
  */!*
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Here the same object handles both events. Please note that we need to explicitly setup the events to listen using `addEventListener`. The `menu` object only gets `mousedown` and `mouseup` here, not any other types of events.

The method `handleEvent` does not have to do all the job by itself. It can call other event-specific methods instead, like this:

```html run
&lt;button id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  class Menu {
    handleEvent(event) {
      // mousedown -&gt; onMousedown
      let method = &quot;on&quot; + event.type[0].toUpperCase() + event.type.slice(1);
      this[method](event);
    }

    onMousedown() {
      elem.innerHTML = &quot;Mouse button pressed&quot;;
    }

    onMouseup() {
      elem.innerHTML += &quot;...and released.&quot;;
    }
  }

  let menu = new Menu();
  elem.addEventListener(&quot;mousedown&quot;, menu);
  elem.addEventListener(&quot;mouseup&quot;, menu);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Now event handlers are clearly separated, that may be easier to support.

## Summary

There are 3 ways to assign event handlers:

1. HTML attribute: `onclick=&quot;...&quot;`.
2. DOM property: `elem.onclick = function`.
3. Methods: `elem.addEventListener(event, handler[, phase])` to add, `removeEventListener` to remove.

HTML attributes are used sparingly, because JavaScript in the middle of an HTML tag looks a little bit odd and alien. Also can&#39;t write lots of code in there.

DOM properties are ok to use, but we can&#39;t assign more than one handler of the particular event. In many cases that limitation is not pressing.

The last way is the most flexible, but it is also the longest to write. There are few events that only work with it, for instance `transitionend` and `DOMContentLoaded` (to be covered). Also `addEventListener` supports objects as event handlers. In that case the method `handleEvent` is called in case of the event.

No matter how you assign the handler -- it gets an event object as the first argument. That object contains the details about what&#39;s happened.

We&#39;ll learn more about events in general and about different types of events in the next chapters.

# Bubbling and capturing

Let&#39;s start with an example.

This handler is assigned to `&lt;div&gt;`, but also runs if you click any nested tag like `&lt;em&gt;` or `&lt;code&gt;`:

```html autorun height=60
&lt;div onclick=&quot;alert(&#39;The handler!&#39;)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;em
    &gt;If you click on &lt;code&gt;EM&lt;/code&gt;, the handler on &lt;code&gt;DIV&lt;/code&gt; runs.&lt;/em
  &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

Isn&#39;t it a bit strange? Why does the handler on `&lt;div&gt;` run if the actual click was on `&lt;em&gt;`?

## Bubbling

The bubbling principle is simple.

**When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.**

Let&#39;s say we have 3 nested elements `FORM &gt; DIV &gt; P` with a handler on each of them:

```html run autorun
&lt;style&gt;
  body * {
    margin: 10px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;form onclick=&quot;alert(&#39;form&#39;)&quot;&gt;
  FORM
  &lt;div onclick=&quot;alert(&#39;div&#39;)&quot;&gt;
    DIV
    &lt;p onclick=&quot;alert(&#39;p&#39;)&quot;&gt;P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
```

A click on the inner `&lt;p&gt;` first runs `onclick`:

1. On that `&lt;p&gt;`.
2. Then on the outer `&lt;div&gt;`.
3. Then on the outer `&lt;form&gt;`.
4. And so on upwards till the `document` object.

![](event-order-bubbling.svg)

So if we click on `&lt;p&gt;`, then we&#39;ll see 3 alerts: `p` -&gt; `div` -&gt; `form`.

The process is called &quot;bubbling&quot;, because events &quot;bubble&quot; from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.

```warn header=&quot;*Almost* all events bubble.&quot;
The key word in this phrase is &quot;almost&quot;.

For instance, a `focus` event does not bubble. There are other examples too, we&#39;ll meet them. But still it&#39;s an exception, rather than a rule, most events do bubble.
```

## event.target

A handler on a parent element can always get the details about where it actually happened.

**The most deeply nested element that caused the event is called a _target_ element, accessible as `event.target`.**

Note the differences from `this` (=`event.currentTarget`):

- `event.target` -- is the &quot;target&quot; element that initiated the event, it doesn&#39;t change through the bubbling process.
- `this` -- is the &quot;current&quot; element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.

For instance, if we have a single handler `form.onclick`, then it can &quot;catch&quot; all clicks inside the form. No matter where the click happened, it bubbles up to `&lt;form&gt;` and runs the handler.

In `form.onclick` handler:

- `this` (=`event.currentTarget`) is the `&lt;form&gt;` element, because the handler runs on it.
- `event.target` is the actual element inside the form that was clicked.

Check it out:

[codetabs height=220 src=&quot;bubble-target&quot;]

It&#39;s possible that `event.target` could equal `this` -- it happens when the click is made directly on the `&lt;form&gt;` element.

## Stopping bubbling

A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till `&lt;html&gt;`, and then to `document` object, and some events even reach `window`, calling all handlers on the path.

But any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.

The method for it is `event.stopPropagation()`.

For instance, here `body.onclick` doesn&#39;t work if you click on `&lt;button&gt;`:

```html run autorun height=60
&lt;body onclick=&quot;alert(`the bubbling doesn&#39;t reach here`)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button onclick=&quot;event.stopPropagation()&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;event.stopImmediatePropagation()&quot;
If an element has multiple event handlers on a single event, then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.

In other words, `event.stopPropagation()` stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.

To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there&#39;s a method `event.stopImmediatePropagation()`. After it no other handlers execute.
```

```warn header=&quot;Don&#39;t stop bubbling without a need!&quot;
Bubbling is convenient. Don&#39;t stop it without a real need: obvious and architecturally well thought out.

Sometimes `event.stopPropagation()` creates hidden pitfalls that later may become problems.

For instance:

1. We create a nested menu. Each submenu handles clicks on its elements and calls `stopPropagation` so that the outer menu won&#39;t trigger.
2. Later we decide to catch clicks on the whole window, to track users&#39; behavior (where people click). Some analytic systems do that. Usually the code uses `document.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;…)` to catch all clicks.
3. Our analytic won&#39;t work over the area where clicks are stopped by `stopPropagation`. Sadly, we&#39;ve got a &quot;dead zone&quot;.

There&#39;s usually no real need to prevent the bubbling. A task that seemingly requires that may be solved by other means. One of them is to use custom events, we&#39;ll cover them later. Also we can write our data into the `event` object in one handler and read it in another one, so we can pass to handlers on parents information about the processing below.
```

## Capturing

There&#39;s another phase of event processing called &quot;capturing&quot;. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.

The standard [DOM Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/) describes 3 phases of event propagation:

1. Capturing phase -- the event goes down to the element.
2. Target phase -- the event reached the target element.
3. Bubbling phase -- the event bubbles up from the element.

Here&#39;s the picture of a click on `&lt;td&gt;` inside a table, taken from the specification:

![](eventflow.svg)

That is: for a click on `&lt;td&gt;` the event first goes through the ancestors chain down to the element (capturing phase), then it reaches the target and triggers there (target phase), and then it goes up (bubbling phase), calling handlers on its way.

**Before we only talked about bubbling, because the capturing phase is rarely used. Normally it is invisible to us.**

Handlers added using `on&lt;event&gt;`-property or using HTML attributes or using two-argument `addEventListener(event, handler)` don&#39;t know anything about capturing, they only run on the 2nd and 3rd phases.

To catch an event on the capturing phase, we need to set the handler `capture` option to `true`:

```js
elem.addEventListener(..., {capture: true})
// or, just &quot;true&quot; is an alias to {capture: true}
elem.addEventListener(..., true)
```

There are two possible values of the `capture` option:

- If it&#39;s `false` (default), then the handler is set on the bubbling phase.
- If it&#39;s `true`, then the handler is set on the capturing phase.

Note that while formally there are 3 phases, the 2nd phase (&quot;target phase&quot;: the event reached the element) is not handled separately: handlers on both capturing and bubbling phases trigger at that phase.

Let&#39;s see both capturing and bubbling in action:

```html run autorun height=140 edit
&lt;style&gt;
  body * {
    margin: 10px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;form&gt;
  FORM
  &lt;div&gt;
    DIV
    &lt;p&gt;P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  for (let elem of document.querySelectorAll(&quot;*&quot;)) {
    elem.addEventListener(
      &quot;click&quot;,
      (e) =&gt; alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`),
      true
    );
    elem.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) =&gt; alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The code sets click handlers on _every_ element in the document to see which ones are working.

If you click on `&lt;p&gt;`, then the sequence is:

1. `HTML` -&gt; `BODY` -&gt; `FORM` -&gt; `DIV` (capturing phase, the first listener):
2. `P` (target phase, triggers two times, as we&#39;ve set two listeners: capturing and bubbling)
3. `DIV` -&gt; `FORM` -&gt; `BODY` -&gt; `HTML` (bubbling phase, the second listener).

There&#39;s a property `event.eventPhase` that tells us the number of the phase on which the event was caught. But it&#39;s rarely used, because we usually know it in the handler.

```smart header=&quot;To remove the handler, `removeEventListener`needs the same phase&quot; If we`addEventListener(..., true)`, then we should mention the same phase in `removeEventListener(..., true)` to correctly remove the handler.

## Summary

When an event happens -- the most nested element where it happens gets labeled as the &quot;target element&quot; (`event.target`).

- Then the event moves down from the document root to `event.target`, calling handlers assigned with `addEventListener(..., true)` on the way (`true` is a shorthand for `{capture: true}`).
- Then handlers are called on the target element itself.
- Then the event bubbles up from `event.target` to the root, calling handlers assigned using `on&lt;event&gt;`, HTML attributes and `addEventListener` without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument `false/{capture:false}`.

Each handler can access `event` object properties:

- `event.target` -- the deepest element that originated the event.
- `event.currentTarget` (=`this`) -- the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)
- `event.eventPhase` -- the current phase (capturing=1, target=2, bubbling=3).

Any event handler can stop the event by calling `event.stopPropagation()`, but that&#39;s not recommended, because we can&#39;t really be sure we won&#39;t need it above, maybe for completely different things.

The capturing phase is used very rarely, usually we handle events on bubbling. And there&#39;s a logic behind that.

In real world, when an accident happens, local authorities react first. They know best the area where it happened. Then higher-level authorities if needed.

The same for event handlers. The code that set the handler on a particular element knows maximum details about the element and what it does. A handler on a particular `&lt;td&gt;` may be suited for that exactly `&lt;td&gt;`, it knows everything about it, so it should get the chance first. Then its immediate parent also knows about the context, but a little bit less, and so on till the very top element that handles general concepts and runs the last one.

Bubbling and capturing lay the foundation for &quot;event delegation&quot; -- an extremely powerful event handling pattern that we study in the next chapter.

# Event delegation

Capturing and bubbling allow us to implement one of most powerful event handling patterns called *event delegation*.

The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them -- we put a single handler on their common ancestor.

In the handler we get `event.target` to see where the event actually happened and handle it.

Let&#39;s see an example -- the [Ba-Gua diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_gua) reflecting the ancient Chinese philosophy.

Here it is:

[iframe height=350 src=&quot;bagua&quot; edit link]

The HTML is like this:

```html
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bagua&lt;/em&gt; Chart: Direction, Element, Color, Meaning&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;nw&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northwest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metal&lt;br&gt;Silver&lt;br&gt;Elders&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;...2 more lines of this kind...&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;...2 more lines of this kind...&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
```

The table has 9 cells, but there could be 99 or 9999, doesn&#39;t matter.

**Our task is to highlight a cell `&lt;td&gt;` on click.**

Instead of assign an `onclick` handler to each `&lt;td&gt;` (can be many) -- we&#39;ll setup the &quot;catch-all&quot; handler on `&lt;table&gt;` element.

It will use `event.target` to get the clicked element and highlight it.

The code:

```js
let selectedTd;

*!*
table.onclick = function(event) {
  let target = event.target; // where was the click?

  if (target.tagName != &#39;TD&#39;) return; // not on TD? Then we&#39;re not interested

  highlight(target); // highlight it
};
*/!*

function highlight(td) {
  if (selectedTd) { // remove the existing highlight if any
    selectedTd.classList.remove(&#39;highlight&#39;);
  }
  selectedTd = td;
  selectedTd.classList.add(&#39;highlight&#39;); // highlight the new td
}
```

Such a code doesn&#39;t care how many cells there are in the table. We can add/remove `&lt;td&gt;` dynamically at any time and the highlighting will still work.

Still, there&#39;s a drawback.

The click may occur not on the `&lt;td&gt;`, but inside it.

In our case if we take a look inside the HTML, we can see nested tags inside `&lt;td&gt;`, like `&lt;strong&gt;`:

```html
&lt;td&gt;
*!*
  &lt;strong&gt;Northwest&lt;/strong&gt;
*/!*
  ...
&lt;/td&gt;
```

Naturally, if a click happens on that `&lt;strong&gt;` then it becomes the value of `event.target`.

![](bagua-bubble.svg)

In the handler `table.onclick` we should take such `event.target` and find out whether the click was inside `&lt;td&gt;` or not.

Here&#39;s the improved code:

```js
table.onclick = function(event) {
  let td = event.target.closest(&#39;td&#39;); // (1)

  if (!td) return; // (2)

  if (!table.contains(td)) return; // (3)

  highlight(td); // (4)
};
```

Explanations:
1. The method `elem.closest(selector)` returns the nearest ancestor that matches the selector. In our case we look for `&lt;td&gt;` on the way up from the source element.
2. If `event.target` is not inside any `&lt;td&gt;`, then the call returns immediately, as there&#39;s nothing to do.
3. In case of nested tables, `event.target` may be a `&lt;td&gt;`, but lying outside of the current table. So we check if that&#39;s actually *our table&#39;s* `&lt;td&gt;`.
4. And, if it&#39;s so, then highlight it.

As the result, we have a fast, efficient highlighting code, that doesn&#39;t care about the total number of `&lt;td&gt;` in the table.

## Delegation example: actions in markup

There are other uses for event delegation.

Let&#39;s say, we want to make a menu with buttons &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Load&quot;, &quot;Search&quot; and so on. And there&#39;s an object with methods `save`, `load`, `search`... How to match them?

The first idea may be to assign a separate handler to each button. But there&#39;s a more elegant solution. We can add a handler for the whole menu and `data-action` attributes for buttons that has the method to call:

```html
&lt;button *!*data-action=&quot;save&quot;*/!*&gt;Click to Save&lt;/button&gt;
```

The handler reads the attribute and executes the method. Take a look at the working example:

```html autorun height=60 run untrusted
&lt;div id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button data-action=&quot;save&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button data-action=&quot;load&quot;&gt;Load&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button data-action=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  class Menu {
    constructor(elem) {
      this._elem = elem;
      elem.onclick = this.onClick.bind(this); // (*)
    }

    save() {
      alert(&#39;saving&#39;);
    }

    load() {
      alert(&#39;loading&#39;);
    }

    search() {
      alert(&#39;searching&#39;);
    }

    onClick(event) {
*!*
      let action = event.target.dataset.action;
      if (action) {
        this[action]();
      }
*/!*
    };
  }

  new Menu(menu);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Please note that `this.onClick` is bound to `this` in `(*)`. That&#39;s important, because otherwise `this` inside it would reference the DOM element (`elem`), not the `Menu` object, and `this[action]` would not be what we need.

So, what advantages does delegation give us here?

```compare
+ We don&#39;t need to write the code to assign a handler to each button. Just make a method and put it in the markup.
+ The HTML structure is flexible, we can add/remove buttons at any time.
```

We could also use classes `.action-save`, `.action-load`, but an attribute `data-action` is better semantically. And we can use it in CSS rules too.

## The &quot;behavior&quot; pattern

We can also use event delegation to add &quot;behaviors&quot; to elements *declaratively*, with special attributes and classes.

The pattern has two parts:
1. We add a custom attribute to an element that describes its behavior.
2. A document-wide handler tracks events, and if an event happens on an attributed element -- performs the action.

### Behavior: Counter

For instance, here the attribute `data-counter` adds a behavior: &quot;increase value on click&quot; to buttons:

```html run autorun height=60
Counter: &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; data-counter&gt;
One more counter: &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; data-counter&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(event) {

    if (event.target.dataset.counter != undefined) { // if the attribute exists...
      event.target.value++;
    }

  });
&lt;/script&gt;
```

If we click a button -- its value is increased. Not buttons, but the general approach is important here.

There can be as many attributes with `data-counter` as we want. We can add new ones to HTML at any moment. Using the event delegation we &quot;extended&quot; HTML, added an attribute that describes a new behavior.

```warn header=&quot;For document-level handlers -- always `addEventListener`&quot;
When we assign an event handler to the `document` object, we should always use `addEventListener`, not `document.on&lt;event&gt;`, because the latter will cause conflicts: new handlers overwrite old ones.

For real projects it&#39;s normal that there are many handlers on `document` set by different parts of the code.
```

### Behavior: Toggler

One more example of behavior. A click on an element with the attribute `data-toggle-id` will show/hide the element with the given `id`:

```html autorun run height=60
&lt;button *!*data-toggle-id=&quot;subscribe-mail&quot;*/!*&gt;
  Show the subscription form
&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;form id=&quot;subscribe-mail&quot; hidden&gt;
  Your mail: &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
*!*
  document.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(event) {
    let id = event.target.dataset.toggleId;
    if (!id) return;

    let elem = document.getElementById(id);

    elem.hidden = !elem.hidden;
  });
*/!*
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Let&#39;s note once again what we did. Now, to add toggling functionality to an element -- there&#39;s no need to know JavaScript, just use the attribute `data-toggle-id`.

That may become really convenient -- no need to write JavaScript for every such element. Just use the behavior. The document-level handler makes it work for any element of the page.

We can combine multiple behaviors on a single element as well.

The &quot;behavior&quot; pattern can be an alternative to mini-fragments of JavaScript.

## Summary

Event delegation is really cool! It&#39;s one of the most helpful patterns for DOM events.

It&#39;s often used to add the same handling for many similar elements, but not only for that.

The algorithm:

1. Put a single handler on the container.
2. In the handler -- check the source element `event.target`.
3. If the event happened inside an element that interests us, then handle the event.

Benefits:

```compare
+ Simplifies initialization and saves memory: no need to add many handlers.
+ Less code: when adding or removing elements, no need to add/remove handlers.
+ DOM modifications: we can mass add/remove elements with `innerHTML` and the like.
```

The delegation has its limitations of course:

```compare
- First, the event must be bubbling. Some events do not bubble. Also, low-level handlers should not use `event.stopPropagation()`.
- Second, the delegation may add CPU load, because the container-level handler reacts on events in any place of the container, no matter whether they interest us or not. But usually the load is negligible, so we don&#39;t take it into account.
```
# Browser default actions

Many events automatically lead to certain actions performed by the browser.

For instance:

- A click on a link - initiates navigation to its URL.
- A click on a form submit button - initiates its submission to the server.
- Pressing a mouse button over a text and moving it - selects the text.

If we handle an event in JavaScript, we may not want the corresponding browser action to happen, and want to implement another behavior instead.

## Preventing browser actions

There are two ways to tell the browser we don&#39;t want it to act:

- The main way is to use the `event` object. There&#39;s a method `event.preventDefault()`.
- If the handler is assigned using `on&lt;event&gt;` (not by `addEventListener`), then returning `false` also works the same.

In this HTML a click on a link doesn&#39;t lead to navigation, browser doesn&#39;t do anything:

```html autorun height=60 no-beautify
&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot; onclick=&quot;return false&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot; onclick=&quot;event.preventDefault()&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
```

In the next example we&#39;ll use this technique to create a JavaScript-powered menu.

```warn header=&quot;Returning `false` from a handler is an exception&quot;
The value returned by an event handler is usually ignored.

The only exception is `return false` from a handler assigned using `on&lt;event&gt;`.

In all other cases, `return` value is ignored. In particular, there&#39;s no sense in returning `true`.
```

### Example: the menu

Consider a site menu, like this:

```html
&lt;ul id=&quot;menu&quot; class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/html&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/javascript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/css&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

Here&#39;s how it looks with some CSS:

[iframe height=70 src=&quot;menu&quot; link edit]

Menu items are implemented as HTML-links `&lt;a&gt;`, not buttons `&lt;button&gt;`. There are several reasons to do so, for instance:

- Many people like to use &quot;right click&quot; -- &quot;open in a new window&quot;. If we use `&lt;button&gt;` or `&lt;span&gt;`, that doesn&#39;t work.
- Search engines follow `&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;` links while indexing.

So we use `&lt;a&gt;` in the markup. But normally we intend to handle clicks in JavaScript. So we should prevent the default browser action.

Like here:

```js
menu.onclick = function(event) {
  if (event.target.nodeName != &#39;A&#39;) return;

  let href = event.target.getAttribute(&#39;href&#39;);
  alert( href ); // ...can be loading from the server, UI generation etc

*!*
  return false; // prevent browser action (don&#39;t go to the URL)
*/!*
};
```

If we omit `return false`, then after our code executes the browser will do its &quot;default action&quot; -- navigating to the URL in `href`. And we don&#39;t need that here, as we&#39;re handling the click by ourselves.

By the way, using event delegation here makes our menu very flexible. We can add nested lists and style them using CSS to &quot;slide down&quot;.

````smart header=&quot;Follow-up events&quot;
Certain events flow one into another. If we prevent the first event, there will be no second.

For instance, `mousedown` on an `&lt;input&gt;` field leads to focusing in it, and the `focus` event. If we prevent the `mousedown` event, there&#39;s no focus.

Try to click on the first `&lt;input&gt;` below -- the `focus` event happens. But if you click the second one, there&#39;s no focus.

```html run autorun
&lt;input value=&quot;Focus works&quot; onfocus=&quot;this.value=&#39;&#39;&quot;&gt;
&lt;input *!*onmousedown=&quot;return false&quot;*/!* onfocus=&quot;this.value=&#39;&#39;&quot; value=&quot;Click me&quot;&gt;
```

That&#39;s because the browser action is canceled on `mousedown`. The focusing is still possible if we use another way to enter the input. For instance, the `key:Tab` key to switch from the 1st input into the 2nd. But not with the mouse click any more.</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-passive-handler-option">The “passive” handler option</h2>
<p>The optional <code>passive: true</code> option of <code>addEventListener</code> signals the browser that the handler is not going to call <code>preventDefault()</code>.</p>
<p>Why that may be needed?</p>
<p>There are some events like <code>touchmove</code> on mobile devices (when the user moves their finger across the screen), that cause scrolling by default, but that scrolling can be prevented using <code>preventDefault()</code> in the handler.</p>
<p>So when the browser detects such event, it has first to process all handlers, and then if <code>preventDefault</code> is not called anywhere, it can proceed with scrolling. That may cause unnecessary delays and “jitters” in the UI.</p>
<p>The <code>passive: true</code> options tells the browser that the handler is not going to cancel scrolling. Then browser scrolls immediately providing a maximally fluent experience, and the event is handled by the way.</p>
<p>For some browsers (Firefox, Chrome), <code>passive</code> is <code>true</code> by default for <code>touchstart</code> and <code>touchmove</code> events.</p>
<h2 id="event.defaultprevented">event.defaultPrevented</h2>
<p>The property <code>event.defaultPrevented</code> is <code>true</code> if the default action was prevented, and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting use case for it.</p>
<p>You remember in the chapter <a href="info:bubbling-and-capturing" class="uri">info:bubbling-and-capturing</a> we talked about <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> and why stopping bubbling is bad?</p>
<p>Sometimes we can use <code>event.defaultPrevented</code> instead, to signal other event handlers that the event was handled.</p>
<p>Let’s see a practical example.</p>
<p>By default the browser on <code>contextmenu</code> event (right mouse click) shows a context menu with standard options. We can prevent it and show our own, like this:</p>
<p>```html autorun height=50 no-beautify run <button>Right-click shows browser context menu</button></p>
<p>&lt;button <em>!</em>oncontextmenu=“alert(‘Draw our menu’); return false”<em>/!</em>&gt; Right-click shows our context menu </button> ```</p>
<p>Now, in addition to that context menu we’d like to implement document-wide context menu.</p>
<p>Upon right click, the closest context menu should show up.</p>
```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run
<p>
Right-click here for the document context menu
</p>
<button id="elem">
Right-click here for the button context menu
</button>
<script>
  elem.oncontextmenu = function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("Button context menu");
  };

  document.oncontextmenu = function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("Document context menu");
  };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>The problem is that when we click on <code>elem</code>, we get two menus: the button-level and (the event bubbles up) the document-level menu.</p>
<p>How to fix it? One of solutions is to think like: “When we handle right-click in the button handler, let’s stop its bubbling” and use <code>event.stopPropagation()</code>:</p>
```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run
<p>
Right-click for the document menu
</p>
<button id="elem">
Right-click for the button menu (fixed with event.stopPropagation)
</button>
<script>
    elem.oncontextmenu = function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
  *!*
      event.stopPropagation();
  */!*
      alert("Button context menu");
    };

    document.oncontextmenu = function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      alert("Document context menu");
    };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Now the button-level menu works as intended. But the price is high. We forever deny access to information about right-clicks for any outer code, including counters that gather statistics and so on. That’s quite unwise.</p>
<p>An alternative solution would be to check in the <code>document</code> handler if the default action was prevented? If it is so, then the event was handled, and we don’t need to react on it.</p>
```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run
<p>
Right-click for the document menu (added a check for event.defaultPrevented)
</p>
<button id="elem">
Right-click for the button menu
</button>
<script>
    elem.oncontextmenu = function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      alert("Button context menu");
    };

    document.oncontextmenu = function(event) {
  *!*
      if (event.defaultPrevented) return;
  */!*

      event.preventDefault();
      alert("Document context menu");
    };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Now everything also works correctly. If we have nested elements, and each of them has a context menu of its own, that would also work. Just make sure to check for <code>event.defaultPrevented</code> in each <code>contextmenu</code> handler.</p>
<p><code>smart header="event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault()" As we can clearly see, `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.preventDefault()` (also known as `return false`) are two different things. They are not related to each other.</code></p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Nested context menus architecture" There are also alternative ways to implement nested context menus. One of them is to have a single global object with a handler for</code>document.oncontextmenu`, and also methods that allow us to store other handlers in it.</p>
<p>The object will catch any right-click, look through stored handlers and run the appropriate one.</p>
<p>But then each piece of code that wants a context menu should know about that object and use its help instead of the own <code>contextmenu</code> handler. ```</p>
<h2 id="summary-2">Summary</h2>
<p>There are many default browser actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mousedown</code> – starts the selection (move the mouse to select).</li>
<li><code>click</code> on <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> – checks/unchecks the <code>input</code>.</li>
<li><code>submit</code> – clicking an <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> or hitting <code>key:Enter</code> inside a form field causes this event to happen, and the browser submits the form after it.</li>
<li><code>keydown</code> – pressing a key may lead to adding a character into a field, or other actions.</li>
<li><code>contextmenu</code> – the event happens on a right-click, the action is to show the browser context menu.</li>
<li>…there are more…</li>
</ul>
<p>All the default actions can be prevented if we want to handle the event exclusively by JavaScript.</p>
<p>To prevent a default action – use either <code>event.preventDefault()</code> or <code>return false</code>. The second method works only for handlers assigned with <code>on&lt;event&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>passive: true</code> option of <code>addEventListener</code> tells the browser that the action is not going to be prevented. That’s useful for some mobile events, like <code>touchstart</code> and <code>touchmove</code>, to tell the browser that it should not wait for all handlers to finish before scrolling.</p>
<p>If the default action was prevented, the value of <code>event.defaultPrevented</code> becomes <code>true</code>, otherwise it’s <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>``<code>warn header="Stay semantic, don't abuse" Technically, by preventing default actions and adding JavaScript we can customize the behavior of any elements. For instance, we can make a link</code><a><code>work like a button, and a button</code><button>` behave as a link (redirect to another URL or so).</p>
<p>But we should generally keep the semantic meaning of HTML elements. For instance, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> should perform navigation, not a button.</p>
<p>Besides being “just a good thing”, that makes your HTML better in terms of accessibility.</p>
<p>Also if we consider the example with <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, then please note: a browser allows us to open such links in a new window (by right-clicking them and other means). And people like that. But if we make a button behave as a link using JavaScript and even look like a link using CSS, then <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>-specific browser features still won’t work for it. ```</p>
<h1 id="dispatching-custom-events">Dispatching custom events</h1>
<p>We can not only assign handlers, but also generate events from JavaScript.</p>
<p>Custom events can be used to create “graphical components”. For instance, a root element of our own JS-based menu may trigger events telling what happens with the menu: <code>open</code> (menu open), <code>select</code> (an item is selected) and so on. Another code may listen for the events and observe what’s happening with the menu.</p>
<p>We can generate not only completely new events, that we invent for our own purposes, but also built-in ones, such as <code>click</code>, <code>mousedown</code> etc. That may be helpful for automated testing.</p>
<h2 id="event-constructor">Event constructor</h2>
<p>Built-in event classes form a hierarchy, similar to DOM element classes. The root is the built-in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#event">Event</a> class.</p>
<p>We can create <code>Event</code> objects like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> event <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">Event</span>(type[<span class="op">,</span> options])<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>type</em> – event type, a string like <code>"click"</code> or our own like <code>"my-event"</code>.</li>
<li><p><em>options</em> – the object with two optional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bubbles: true/false</code> – if <code>true</code>, then the event bubbles.</li>
<li><code>cancelable: true/false</code> – if <code>true</code>, then the “default action” may be prevented. Later we’ll see what it means for custom events.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default both are false: <code>{bubbles: false, cancelable: false}</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dispatchevent">dispatchEvent</h2>
<p>After an event object is created, we should “run” it on an element using the call <code>elem.dispatchEvent(event)</code>.</p>
<p>Then handlers react on it as if it were a regular browser event. If the event was created with the <code>bubbles</code> flag, then it bubbles.</p>
<p>In the example below the <code>click</code> event is initiated in JavaScript. The handler works same way as if the button was clicked:</p>
<p>```html run no-beautify <button id="elem" onclick="alert('Click!');">Autoclick</button></p>
<script>
  let event = new Event("click");
  elem.dispatchEvent(event);
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>```smart header=“event.isTrusted” There is a way to tell a “real” user event from a script-generated one.</p>
<p>The property <code>event.isTrusted</code> is <code>true</code> for events that come from real user actions and <code>false</code> for script-generated events. ```</p>
<h2 id="bubbling-example">Bubbling example</h2>
<p>We can create a bubbling event with the name <code>"hello"</code> and catch it on <code>document</code>.</p>
<p>All we need is to set <code>bubbles</code> to <code>true</code>:</p>
```html run no-beautify
<h1 id="elem">
Hello from the script!
</h1>
<script>
  // catch on document...
  document.addEventListener("hello", function (event) {
    // (1)
    alert("Hello from " + event.target.tagName); // Hello from H1
  });

  // ...dispatch on elem!
  let event = new Event("hello", { bubbles: true }); // (2)
  elem.dispatchEvent(event);

  // the handler on document will activate and display the message.
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We should use <code>addEventListener</code> for our custom events, because <code>on&lt;event&gt;</code> only exists for built-in events, <code>document.onhello</code> doesn’t work.</li>
<li>Must set <code>bubbles:true</code>, otherwise the event won’t bubble up.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bubbling mechanics is the same for built-in (<code>click</code>) and custom (<code>hello</code>) events. There are also capturing and bubbling stages.</p>
<h2 id="mouseevent-keyboardevent-and-others">MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and others</h2>
<p>Here’s a short list of classes for UI Events from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents">UI Event specification</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UIEvent</code></li>
<li><code>FocusEvent</code></li>
<li><code>MouseEvent</code></li>
<li><code>WheelEvent</code></li>
<li><code>KeyboardEvent</code></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>We should use them instead of <code>new Event</code> if we want to create such events. For instance, <code>new MouseEvent("click")</code>.</p>
<p>The right constructor allows to specify standard properties for that type of event.</p>
<p>Like <code>clientX/clientY</code> for a mouse event:</p>
<p>```js run let event = new MouseEvent(“click”, { bubbles: true, cancelable: true, clientX: 100, clientY: 100 });</p>
<p><em>!</em> alert(event.clientX); // 100 <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Please note: the generic <code>Event</code> constructor does not allow that.</p>
<p>Let’s try:</p>
<p>```js run let event = new Event(“click”, { bubbles: true, // only bubbles and cancelable cancelable: true, // work in the Event constructor clientX: 100, clientY: 100 });</p>
<p><em>!</em> alert(event.clientX); // undefined, the unknown property is ignored! <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Technically, we can work around that by assigning directly <code>event.clientX=100</code> after creation. So that’s a matter of convenience and following the rules. Browser-generated events always have the right type.</p>
<p>The full list of properties for different UI events is in the specification, for instance, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#mouseevent">MouseEvent</a>.</p>
<h2 id="custom-events">Custom events</h2>
<p>For our own, completely new events types like <code>"hello"</code> we should use <code>new CustomEvent</code>. Technically <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#customevent">CustomEvent</a> is the same as <code>Event</code>, with one exception.</p>
<p>In the second argument (object) we can add an additional property <code>detail</code> for any custom information that we want to pass with the event.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
```html run refresh
<h1 id="elem">
Hello for John!
</h1>
<script>
    // additional details come with the event to the handler
    elem.addEventListener("hello", function(event) {
      alert(*!*event.detail.name*/!*);
    });

    elem.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("hello", {
  *!*
      detail: { name: "John" }
  */!*
    }));
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>The <code>detail</code> property can have any data. Technically we could live without, because we can assign any properties into a regular <code>new Event</code> object after its creation. But <code>CustomEvent</code> provides the special <code>detail</code> field for it to evade conflicts with other event properties.</p>
<p>Besides, the event class describes “what kind of event” it is, and if the event is custom, then we should use <code>CustomEvent</code> just to be clear about what it is.</p>
<h2 id="event.preventdefault">event.preventDefault()</h2>
<p>Many browser events have a “default action”, such as navigating to a link, starting a selection, and so on.</p>
<p>For new, custom events, there are definitely no default browser actions, but a code that dispatches such event may have its own plans what to do after triggering the event.</p>
<p>By calling <code>event.preventDefault()</code>, an event handler may send a signal that those actions should be canceled.</p>
<p>In that case the call to <code>elem.dispatchEvent(event)</code> returns <code>false</code>. And the code that dispatched it knows that it shouldn’t continue.</p>
<p>Let’s see a practical example - a hiding rabbit (could be a closing menu or something else).</p>
<p>Below you can see a <code>#rabbit</code> and <code>hide()</code> function that dispatches <code>"hide"</code> event on it, to let all interested parties know that the rabbit is going to hide.</p>
<p>Any handler can listen for that event with <code>rabbit.addEventListener('hide',...)</code> and, if needed, cancel the action using <code>event.preventDefault()</code>. Then the rabbit won’t disappear:</p>
```html run refresh autorun
<pre id="rabbit">
  |\   /|
   \|_|/
   /. .\
  =\_Y_/=
   {>o<}
</pre>
<button onclick="hide()">
Hide()
</button>
<script>
  function hide() {
    let event = new CustomEvent("hide", {
      cancelable: true, // without that flag preventDefault doesn't work
    });
    if (!rabbit.dispatchEvent(event)) {
      alert("The action was prevented by a handler");
    } else {
      rabbit.hidden = true;
    }
  }

  rabbit.addEventListener("hide", function (event) {
    if (confirm("Call preventDefault?")) {
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  });
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Please note: the event must have the flag <code>cancelable: true</code>, otherwise the call <code>event.preventDefault()</code> is ignored.</p>
<h2 id="events-in-events-are-synchronous">Events-in-events are synchronous</h2>
<p>Usually events are processed in a queue. That is: if the browser is processing <code>onclick</code> and a new event occurs, e.g. mouse moved, then it’s handling is queued up, corresponding <code>mousemove</code> handlers will be called after <code>onclick</code> processing is finished.</p>
<p>The notable exception is when one event is initiated from within another one, e.g. using <code>dispatchEvent</code>. Such events are processed immediately: the new event handlers are called, and then the current event handling is resumed.</p>
<p>For instance, in the code below the <code>menu-open</code> event is triggered during the <code>onclick</code>.</p>
<p>It’s processed immediately, without waiting for <code>onclick</code> handler to end:</p>
<p>```html run autorun <button id="menu">Menu (click me)</button></p>
<script>
  menu.onclick = function () {
    alert(1);

    menu.dispatchEvent(
      new CustomEvent("menu-open", {
        bubbles: true,
      })
    );

    alert(2);
  };

  // triggers between 1 and 2
  document.addEventListener("menu-open", () => alert("nested"));
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>The output order is: 1 -&gt; nested -&gt; 2.</p>
<p>Please note that the nested event <code>menu-open</code> is caught on the <code>document</code>. The propagation and handling of the nested event is finished before the processing gets back to the outer code (<code>onclick</code>).</p>
<p>That’s not only about <code>dispatchEvent</code>, there are other cases. If an event handler calls methods that trigger other events – they are processed synchronously too, in a nested fashion.</p>
<p>Let’s say we don’t like it. We’d want <code>onclick</code> to be fully processed first, independently from <code>menu-open</code> or any other nested events.</p>
<p>Then we can either put the <code>dispatchEvent</code> (or another event-triggering call) at the end of <code>onclick</code> or, maybe better, wrap it in the zero-delay <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
<p>```html run <button id="menu">Menu (click me)</button></p>
<script>
  menu.onclick = function () {
    alert(1);

    setTimeout(() =>
      menu.dispatchEvent(
        new CustomEvent("menu-open", {
          bubbles: true,
        })
      )
    );

    alert(2);
  };

  document.addEventListener("menu-open", () => alert("nested"));
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Now <code>dispatchEvent</code> runs asynchronously after the current code execution is finished, including <code>menu.onclick</code>, so event handlers are totally separate.</p>
<p>The output order becomes: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; nested.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2>
<p>To generate an event from code, we first need to create an event object.</p>
<p>The generic <code>Event(name, options)</code> constructor accepts an arbitrary event name and the <code>options</code> object with two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bubbles: true</code> if the event should bubble.</li>
<li><code>cancelable: true</code> if the <code>event.preventDefault()</code> should work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other constructors of native events like <code>MouseEvent</code>, <code>KeyboardEvent</code> and so on accept properties specific to that event type. For instance, <code>clientX</code> for mouse events.</p>
<p>For custom events we should use <code>CustomEvent</code> constructor. It has an additional option named <code>detail</code>, we should assign the event-specific data to it. Then all handlers can access it as <code>event.detail</code>.</p>
<p>Despite the technical possibility of generating browser events like <code>click</code> or <code>keydown</code>, we should use them with great care.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t generate browser events as it’s a hacky way to run handlers. That’s bad architecture most of the time.</p>
<p>Native events might be generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a dirty hack to make 3rd-party libraries work the needed way, if they don’t provide other means of interaction.</li>
<li>For automated testing, to “click the button” in the script and see if the interface reacts correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom events with our own names are often generated for architectural purposes, to signal what happens inside our menus, sliders, carousels etc.</p>
<h1 id="mouse-events">Mouse events</h1>
<p>In this chapter we’ll get into more details about mouse events and their properties.</p>
<p>Please note: such events may come not only from “mouse devices”, but are also from other devices, such as phones and tablets, where they are emulated for compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="mouse-event-types">Mouse event types</h2>
<p>We’ve already seen some of these events:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>mousedown/mouseup</code></dt>
<dd>Mouse button is clicked/released over an element.
</dd>
<dt><code>mouseover/mouseout</code></dt>
<dd>Mouse pointer comes over/out from an element.
</dd>
<dt><code>mousemove</code></dt>
<dd>Every mouse move over an element triggers that event.
</dd>
<dt><code>click</code></dt>
<dd>Triggers after <code>mousedown</code> and then <code>mouseup</code> over the same element if the left mouse button was used.
</dd>
<dt><code>dblclick</code></dt>
<dd>Triggers after two clicks on the same element within a short timeframe. Rarely used nowadays.
</dd>
<dt><code>contextmenu</code></dt>
<dd>Triggers when the right mouse button is pressed. There are other ways to open a context menu, e.g. using a special keyboard key, it triggers in that case also, so it’s not exactly the mouse event.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>…There are several other events too, we’ll cover them later.</p>
<h2 id="events-order">Events order</h2>
<p>As you can see from the list above, a user action may trigger multiple events.</p>
<p>For instance, a left-button click first triggers <code>mousedown</code>, when the button is pressed, then <code>mouseup</code> and <code>click</code> when it’s released.</p>
<p>In cases when a single action initiates multiple events, their order is fixed. That is, the handlers are called in the order <code>mousedown</code> -&gt; <code>mouseup</code> -&gt; <code>click</code>.</p>
<pre class="online"><code>Click the button below and you&#39;ll see the events. Try double-click too.

On the teststand below all mouse events are logged, and if there is more than a 1 second delay between them they are separated by a horizontal ruler.

Also we can see the `button` property that allows to detect the mouse button, it&#39;s explained below.

&lt;input onmousedown=&quot;return logMouse(event)&quot; onmouseup=&quot;return logMouse(event)&quot; onclick=&quot;return logMouse(event)&quot; oncontextmenu=&quot;return logMouse(event)&quot; ondblclick=&quot;return logMouse(event)&quot; value=&quot;Click me with the right or the left mouse button&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; &lt;input onclick=&quot;logClear(&#39;test&#39;)&quot; value=&quot;Clear&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; &lt;form id=&quot;testform&quot; name=&quot;testform&quot;&gt; &lt;textarea style=&quot;font-size:12px;height:150px;width:360px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="mouse-button">Mouse button</h2>
<p>Click-related events always have the <code>button</code> property, which allows to get the exact mouse button.</p>
<p>We usually don’t use it for <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> events, because the former happens only on left-click, and the latter – only on right-click.</p>
<p>From the other hand, <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> handlers may need <code>event.button</code>, because these events trigger on any button, so <code>button</code> allows to distinguish between “right-mousedown” and “left-mousedown”.</p>
<p>The possible values of <code>event.button</code> are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Button state</th>
<th><code>event.button</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Left button (primary)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Middle button (auxiliary)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Right button (secondary)</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>X1 button (back)</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>X2 button (forward)</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Most mouse devices only have the left and right buttons, so possible values are <code>0</code> or <code>2</code>. Touch devices also generate similar events when one taps on them.</p>
<p>Also there’s <code>event.buttons</code> property that has all currently pressed buttons as an integer, one bit per button. In practice this property is very rarely used, you can find details at <a href="mdn:/api/MouseEvent/buttons">MDN</a> if you ever need it.</p>
<p>``<code>warn header="The outdated</code>event.which<code>" Old code may use</code>event.which` property that’s an old non-standard way of getting a button, with possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>event.which == 1</code> – left button,</li>
<li><code>event.which == 2</code> – middle button,</li>
<li><code>event.which == 3</code> – right button.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now, <code>event.which</code> is deprecated, we shouldn’t use it.</p>
<pre><code>
## Modifiers: shift, alt, ctrl and meta

All mouse events include the information about pressed modifier keys.

Event properties:

- `shiftKey`: `key:Shift`
- `altKey`: `key:Alt` (or `key:Opt` for Mac)
- `ctrlKey`: `key:Ctrl`
- `metaKey`: `key:Cmd` for Mac

They are `true` if the corresponding key was pressed during the event.

For instance, the button below only works on `key:Alt+Shift`+click:

```html autorun height=60
&lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Alt+Shift+Click on me!&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  button.onclick = function(event) {
*!*
    if (event.altKey &amp;&amp; event.shiftKey) {
*/!*
      alert(&#39;Hooray!&#39;);
    }
  };
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>``<code>warn header="Attention: on Mac it's usually</code>Cmd<code>instead of</code>Ctrl<code>" On Windows and Linux there are modifier keys</code>key:Alt<code>,</code>key:Shift<code>and</code>key:Ctrl<code>. On Mac there's one more:</code>key:Cmd<code>, corresponding to the property</code>metaKey`.</p>
<p>In most applications, when Windows/Linux uses <code>key:Ctrl</code>, on Mac <code>key:Cmd</code> is used.</p>
<p>That is: where a Windows user presses <code>key:Ctrl+Enter</code> or <code>key:Ctrl+A</code>, a Mac user would press <code>key:Cmd+Enter</code> or <code>key:Cmd+A</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>So if we want to support combinations like <code>key:Ctrl</code>+click, then for Mac it makes sense to use <code>key:Cmd</code>+click. That’s more comfortable for Mac users.</p>
<p>Even if we’d like to force Mac users to <code>key:Ctrl</code>+click – that’s kind of difficult. The problem is: a left-click with <code>key:Ctrl</code> is interpreted as a <em>right-click</em> on MacOS, and it generates the <code>contextmenu</code> event, not <code>click</code> like Windows/Linux.</p>
<p>So if we want users of all operating systems to feel comfortable, then together with <code>ctrlKey</code> we should check <code>metaKey</code>.</p>
<p>For JS-code it means that we should check <code>if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
```warn header=&quot;There are also mobile devices&quot;
Keyboard combinations are good as an addition to the workflow. So that if the visitor uses a keyboard -- they work.

But if their device doesn&#39;t have it -- then there should be a way to live without modifier keys.</code></pre>
<h2 id="coordinates-clientxy-pagexy">Coordinates: clientX/Y, pageX/Y</h2>
<p>All mouse events provide coordinates in two flavours:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Window-relative: <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code>.</li>
<li>Document-relative: <code>pageX</code> and <code>pageY</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We already covered the difference between them in the chapter <a href="info:coordinates" class="uri">info:coordinates</a>.</p>
<p>In short, document-relative coordinates <code>pageX/Y</code> are counted from the left-upper corner of the document, and do not change when the page is scrolled, while <code>clientX/Y</code> are counted from the current window left-upper corner. When the page is scrolled, they change.</p>
<p>For instance, if we have a window of the size 500x500, and the mouse is in the left-upper corner, then <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> are <code>0</code>, no matter how the page is scrolled.</p>
<p>And if the mouse is in the center, then <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> are <code>250</code>, no matter what place in the document it is. They are similar to <code>position:fixed</code> in that aspect.</p>
<pre class="online"><code>Move the mouse over the input field to see `clientX/clientY` (the example is in the `iframe`, so coordinates are relative to that `iframe`):

```html autorun height=50
&lt;input onmousemove=&quot;this.value=event.clientX+&#39;:&#39;+event.clientY&quot; value=&quot;Mouse over me&quot;&gt;
```</code></pre>
<h2 id="preventing-selection-on-mousedown">Preventing selection on mousedown</h2>
<p>Double mouse click has a side-effect that may be disturbing in some interfaces: it selects text.</p>
<p>For instance, double-clicking on the text below selects it in addition to our handler:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=50 &lt;span ondblclick="alert('dblclick')"&gt;Double-click me&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
<p>If one presses the left mouse button and, without releasing it, moves the mouse, that also makes the selection, often unwanted.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to prevent the selection, that you can read in the chapter <a href="info:selection-range" class="uri">info:selection-range</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular case the most reasonable way is to prevent the browser action on <code>mousedown</code>. It prevents both these selections:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=50 Before... &lt;b ondblclick="alert('Click!')" *!*onmousedown="return false"*/!*&gt;   Double-click me &lt;/b&gt; ...After</code></p>
<p>Now the bold element is not selected on double clicks, and pressing the left button on it won’t start the selection.</p>
<p>Please note: the text inside it is still selectable. However, the selection should start not on the text itself, but before or after it. Usually that’s fine for users.</p>
<p>```<code>smart header="Preventing copying" If we want to disable selection to protect our page content from copy-pasting, then we can use another event:</code>oncopy`.</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=80 no-beautify &lt;div *!*oncopy="alert('Copying forbidden!');return false"*/!*&gt;   Dear user,   The copying is forbidden for you.   If you know JS or HTML, then you can get everything from the page source though. &lt;/div&gt;</code> If you try to copy a piece of text in the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, that won’t work, because the default action <code>oncopy</code> is prevented.</p>
<p>Surely the user has access to HTML-source of the page, and can take the content from there, but not everyone knows how to do it. ````</p>
<h2 id="summary-4">Summary</h2>
<p>Mouse events have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button: <code>button</code>.</li>
<li><p>Modifier keys (<code>true</code> if pressed): <code>altKey</code>, <code>ctrlKey</code>, <code>shiftKey</code> and <code>metaKey</code> (Mac).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to handle <code>key:Ctrl</code>, then don’t forget Mac users, they usually use <code>key:Cmd</code>, so it’s better to check <code>if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Window-relative coordinates: <code>clientX/clientY</code>.</li>
<li><p>Document-relative coordinates: <code>pageX/pageY</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The default browser action of <code>mousedown</code> is text selection, if it’s not good for the interface, then it should be prevented.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we’ll see more details about events that follow pointer movement and how to track element changes under it.</p>
<h1 id="type-conversions">Type Conversions</h1>
<p>Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.</p>
<p>For example, <code>alert</code> automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.</p>
<p>There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.</p>
<p>```smart header=“Not talking about objects yet” In this chapter, we won’t cover objects. For now we’ll just be talking about primitives.</p>
<p>Later, after we learn about objects, in the chapter <a href="info:object-toprimitive" class="uri">info:object-toprimitive</a> we’ll see how objects fit in. ```</p>
<h2 id="string-conversion">String Conversion</h2>
<p>String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.</p>
<p>For example, <code>alert(value)</code> does it to show the value.</p>
<p>We can also call the <code>String(value)</code> function to convert a value to a string:</p>
<p>```js run let value = true; alert(typeof value); // boolean</p>
<p><em>!</em> value = String(value); // now value is a string “true” alert(typeof value); // string <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>String conversion is mostly obvious. A <code>false</code> becomes <code>"false"</code>, <code>null</code> becomes <code>"null"</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="numeric-conversion">Numeric Conversion</h2>
<p>Numeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.</p>
<p>For example, when division <code>/</code> is applied to non-numbers:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("6" / "2"); // 3, strings are converted to numbers</code></p>
<p>We can use the <code>Number(value)</code> function to explicitly convert a <code>value</code> to a number:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “123”; alert(typeof str); // string</p>
<p>let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123</p>
<p>alert(typeof num); // number ```</p>
<p>Explicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but expect a number to be entered.</p>
<p>If the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is <code>NaN</code>. For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let age = Number(“an arbitrary string instead of a number”);</p>
<p>alert(age); // NaN, conversion failed ```</p>
<p>Numeric conversion rules:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%" />
<col style="width: 82%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Becomes…</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>undefined</code></td>
<td><code>NaN</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>null</code></td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>true and false</code></td>
<td><code>1</code> and <code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>string</code></td>
<td>Whitespaces from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is <code>0</code>. Otherwise, the number is “read” from the string. An error gives <code>NaN</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(Number("   123   ")); // 123 alert(Number("123z")); // NaN (error reading a number at "z") alert(Number(true)); // 1 alert(Number(false)); // 0</code></p>
<p>Please note that <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> behave differently here: <code>null</code> becomes zero while <code>undefined</code> becomes <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<p>Most mathematical operators also perform such conversion, we’ll see that in the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="boolean-conversion">Boolean Conversion</h2>
<p>Boolean conversion is the simplest one.</p>
<p>It happens in logical operations (later we’ll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to <code>Boolean(value)</code>.</p>
<p>The conversion rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values that are intuitively “empty”, like <code>0</code>, an empty string, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and <code>NaN</code>, become <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Other values become <code>true</code>.</li>

## Summary

The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

**`String Conversion`** -- Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`. The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

**`Numeric Conversion`** -- Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`.

The conversion follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`undefined`|`NaN`|
|`null`|`0`|
|&lt;code&gt;true&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;false&lt;/code&gt; | `1 / 0` |
| `string` | The string is read &quot;as is&quot;, whitespaces from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes `0`. An error gives `NaN`. |

**`Boolean Conversion`** -- Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.

Follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `&quot;&quot;` |`false`|
|any other value| `true` |


Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

- `undefined` is `NaN` as a number, not `0`.
- `&quot;0&quot;` and space-only strings like `&quot;   &quot;` are true as a boolean.

Objects aren&#39;t covered here. We&#39;ll return to them later in the chapter &lt;info:object-toprimitive&gt; that is devoted exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript.
# Moving the mouse: mouseover/out, mouseenter/leave

Let&#39;s dive into more details about events that happen when the mouse moves between elements.

## Events mouseover/mouseout, relatedTarget

The `mouseover` event occurs when a mouse pointer comes over an element, and `mouseout` -- when it leaves.

![](mouseover-mouseout.svg)

These events are special, because they have property `relatedTarget`. This property complements `target`. When a mouse leaves one element for another, one of them becomes `target`, and the other one - `relatedTarget`.

For `mouseover`:

- `event.target` -- is the element where the mouse came over.
- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the element from which the mouse came (`relatedTarget` -&gt; `target`).

For `mouseout` the reverse:

- `event.target` -- is the element that the mouse left.
- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the new under-the-pointer element, that mouse left for (`target` -&gt; `relatedTarget`).

```online
In the example below each face and its features are separate elements. When you move the mouse, you can see mouse events in the text area.

Each event has the information about both `target` and `relatedTarget`:

[codetabs src=&quot;mouseoverout&quot; height=280]
```

```warn header=&quot;`relatedTarget` can be `null`&quot;
The `relatedTarget` property can be `null`.

That&#39;s normal and just means that the mouse came not from another element, but from out of the window. Or that it left the window.

We should keep that possibility in mind when using `event.relatedTarget` in our code. If we access `event.relatedTarget.tagName`, then there will be an error.
```

## Skipping elements

The `mousemove` event triggers when the mouse moves. But that doesn&#39;t mean that every pixel leads to an event.

The browser checks the mouse position from time to time. And if it notices changes then triggers the events.

That means that if the visitor is moving the mouse very fast then some DOM-elements may be skipped:

![](mouseover-mouseout-over-elems.svg)

If the mouse moves very fast from `#FROM` to `#TO` elements as painted above, then intermediate `&lt;div&gt;` elements (or some of them) may be skipped. The `mouseout` event may trigger on `#FROM` and then immediately `mouseover` on `#TO`.

That&#39;s good for performance, because there may be many intermediate elements. We don&#39;t really want to process in and out of each one.

On the other hand, we should keep in mind that the mouse pointer doesn&#39;t &quot;visit&quot; all elements along the way. It can &quot;jump&quot;.

In particular, it&#39;s possible that the pointer jumps right inside the middle of the page from out of the window. In that case `relatedTarget` is `null`, because it came from &quot;nowhere&quot;:

![](mouseover-mouseout-from-outside.svg)

```online
You can check it out &quot;live&quot; on a teststand below.

Its HTML has two nested elements: the `&lt;div id=&quot;child&quot;&gt;` is inside the `&lt;div id=&quot;parent&quot;&gt;`. If you move the mouse fast over them, then maybe only the child div triggers events, or maybe the parent one, or maybe there will be no events at all.

Also move the pointer into the child `div`, and then move it out quickly down through the parent one. If the movement is fast enough, then the parent element is ignored. The mouse will cross the parent element without noticing it.

[codetabs height=360 src=&quot;mouseoverout-fast&quot;]
```

```smart header=&quot;If `mouseover` triggered, there must be `mouseout`&quot;
In case of fast mouse movements, intermediate elements may be ignored, but one thing we know for sure: if the pointer &quot;officially&quot; entered an element (`mouseover` event generated), then upon leaving it we always get `mouseout`.
```

## Mouseout when leaving for a child

An important feature of `mouseout` -- it triggers, when the pointer moves from an element to its descendant, e.g. from `#parent` to `#child` in this HTML:

```html
&lt;div id=&quot;parent&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;child&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

If we&#39;re on `#parent` and then move the pointer deeper into `#child`, we get `mouseout` on `#parent`!

![](mouseover-to-child.svg)

That may seem strange, but can be easily explained.

**According to the browser logic, the mouse cursor may be only over a *single* element at any time -- the most nested one and top by z-index.**

So if it goes to another element (even a descendant), then it leaves the previous one.

Please note another important detail of event processing.

The `mouseover` event on a descendant bubbles up. So, if `#parent` has `mouseover` handler, it triggers:

![](mouseover-bubble-nested.svg)

```online
You can see that very well in the example below: `&lt;div id=&quot;child&quot;&gt;` is inside the `&lt;div id=&quot;parent&quot;&gt;`. There are `mouseover/out` handlers on `#parent` element that output event details.

If you move the mouse from `#parent` to `#child`, you see two events on `#parent`:
1. `mouseout [target: parent]` (left the parent), then
2. `mouseover [target: child]` (came to the child, bubbled).

[codetabs height=360 src=&quot;mouseoverout-child&quot;]
```

As shown, when the pointer moves from `#parent` element to `#child`, two handlers trigger on the parent element: `mouseout` and `mouseover`:

```js
parent.onmouseout = function(event) {
  /* event.target: parent element */
};
parent.onmouseover = function(event) {
  /* event.target: child element (bubbled) */
};
```

**If we don&#39;t examine `event.target` inside the handlers, then it may seem that the mouse pointer left `#parent` element, and then immediately came back over it.**

But that&#39;s not the case! The pointer is still over the parent, it just moved deeper into the child element.

If there are some actions upon leaving the parent element, e.g. an animation runs in `parent.onmouseout`, we usually don&#39;t want it when the pointer just goes deeper into `#parent`.

To avoid it, we can check `relatedTarget` in the handler and, if the mouse is still inside the element, then ignore such event.

Alternatively we can use other events: `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`, that we&#39;ll be covering now, as they don&#39;t have such problems.

## Events mouseenter and mouseleave

Events `mouseenter/mouseleave` are like `mouseover/mouseout`. They trigger when the mouse pointer enters/leaves the element.

But there are two important differences:

1. Transitions inside the element, to/from descendants, are not counted.
2. Events `mouseenter/mouseleave` do not bubble.

These events are extremely simple.

When the pointer enters an element -- `mouseenter` triggers. The exact location of the pointer inside the element or its descendants doesn&#39;t matter.

When the pointer leaves an element -- `mouseleave` triggers.

```online
This example is similar to the one above, but now the top element has `mouseenter/mouseleave` instead of `mouseover/mouseout`.

As you can see, the only generated events are the ones related to moving the pointer in and out of the top element. Nothing happens when the pointer goes to the child and back. Transitions between descendants are ignored

[codetabs height=340 src=&quot;mouseleave&quot;]
```

## Event delegation

Events `mouseenter/leave` are very simple and easy to use. But they do not bubble. So we can&#39;t use event delegation with them.

Imagine we want to handle mouse enter/leave for table cells. And there are hundreds of cells.

The natural solution would be -- to set the handler on `&lt;table&gt;` and process events there. But `mouseenter/leave` don&#39;t bubble. So if such event happens on `&lt;td&gt;`, then only a handler on that `&lt;td&gt;` is able to catch it.

Handlers for `mouseenter/leave` on `&lt;table&gt;` only trigger when the pointer enters/leaves the table as a whole. It&#39;s impossible to get any information about transitions inside it.

So, let&#39;s use `mouseover/mouseout`.

Let&#39;s start with simple handlers that highlight the element under mouse:

```js
// let&#39;s highlight an element under the pointer
table.onmouseover = function(event) {
  let target = event.target;
  target.style.background = &#39;pink&#39;;
};

table.onmouseout = function(event) {
  let target = event.target;
  target.style.background = &#39;&#39;;
};
```

```online
Here they are in action. As the mouse travels across the elements of this table, the current one is highlighted:

[codetabs height=480 src=&quot;mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation&quot;]
```

In our case we&#39;d like to handle transitions between table cells `&lt;td&gt;`: entering a cell and leaving it. Other transitions, such as inside the cell or outside of any cells, don&#39;t interest us. Let&#39;s filter them out.

Here&#39;s what we can do:

- Remember the currently highlighted `&lt;td&gt;` in a variable, let&#39;s call it `currentElem`.
- On `mouseover` -- ignore the event if we&#39;re still inside the current `&lt;td&gt;`.
- On `mouseout` -- ignore if we didn&#39;t leave the current `&lt;td&gt;`.

Here&#39;s an example of code that accounts for all possible situations:

[js src=&quot;mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation-2/script.js&quot;]

Once again, the important features are:
1. It uses event delegation to handle entering/leaving of any `&lt;td&gt;` inside the table. So it relies on `mouseover/out` instead of `mouseenter/leave` that don&#39;t bubble and hence allow no delegation.
2. Extra events, such as moving between descendants of `&lt;td&gt;` are filtered out, so that `onEnter/Leave` runs only if the pointer leaves or enters `&lt;td&gt;` as a whole.

```online
Here&#39;s the full example with all details:

[codetabs height=460 src=&quot;mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation-2&quot;]

Try to move the cursor in and out of table cells and inside them. Fast or slow -- doesn&#39;t matter. Only `&lt;td&gt;` as a whole is highlighted, unlike the example before.
```

## Summary

We covered events `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousemove`, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`.

These things are good to note:

- A fast mouse move may skip intermediate elements.
- Events `mouseover/out` and `mouseenter/leave` have an additional property: `relatedTarget`. That&#39;s the element that we are coming from/to, complementary to `target`.

Events `mouseover/out` trigger even when we go from the parent element to a child element. The browser assumes that the mouse can be only over one element at one time -- the deepest one.

Events `mouseenter/leave` are different in that aspect: they only trigger when the mouse comes in and out the element as a whole. Also they do not bubble.
# Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop with mouse events

Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop is a great interface solution. Taking something and dragging and dropping it is a clear and simple way to do many things, from copying and moving documents (as in file managers) to ordering (dropping items into a cart).

In the modern HTML standard there&#39;s a [section about Drag and Drop](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dnd) with special events such as `dragstart`, `dragend`, and so on.

These events allow us to support special kinds of drag&#39;n&#39;drop, such as handling dragging a file from OS file-manager and dropping it into the browser window. Then JavaScript can access the contents of such files.

But native Drag Events also have limitations. For instance, we can&#39;t prevent dragging from a certain area. Also we can&#39;t make the dragging &quot;horizontal&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot; only. And there are many other drag&#39;n&#39;drop tasks that can&#39;t be done using them. Also, mobile device support for such events is very weak.

So here we&#39;ll see how to implement Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop using mouse events.

## Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop algorithm

The basic Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop algorithm looks like this:

1. On `mousedown` - prepare the element for moving, if needed (maybe create a clone of it, add a class to it or whatever).
2. Then on `mousemove` move it by changing `left/top` with `position:absolute`.
3. On `mouseup` - perform all actions related to finishing the drag&#39;n&#39;drop.

These are the basics. Later we&#39;ll see how to other features, such as highlighting current underlying elements while we drag over them.

Here&#39;s the implementation of dragging a ball:

```js
ball.onmousedown = function(event) {
  // (1) prepare to moving: make absolute and on top by z-index
  ball.style.position = &#39;absolute&#39;;
  ball.style.zIndex = 1000;

  // move it out of any current parents directly into body
  // to make it positioned relative to the body
  document.body.append(ball);

  // centers the ball at (pageX, pageY) coordinates
  function moveAt(pageX, pageY) {
    ball.style.left = pageX - ball.offsetWidth / 2 + &#39;px&#39;;
    ball.style.top = pageY - ball.offsetHeight / 2 + &#39;px&#39;;
  }

  // move our absolutely positioned ball under the pointer
  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);

  function onMouseMove(event) {
    moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);
  }

  // (2) move the ball on mousemove
  document.addEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, onMouseMove);

  // (3) drop the ball, remove unneeded handlers
  ball.onmouseup = function() {
    document.removeEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, onMouseMove);
    ball.onmouseup = null;
  };

};
```

If we run the code, we can notice something strange. On the beginning of the drag&#39;n&#39;drop, the ball &quot;forks&quot;: we start dragging its &quot;clone&quot;.

```online
Here&#39;s an example in action:

[iframe src=&quot;ball&quot; height=230]

Try to drag&#39;n&#39;drop with the mouse and you&#39;ll see such behavior.
```

That&#39;s because the browser has its own drag&#39;n&#39;drop support for images and some other elements. It runs automatically and conflicts with ours.

To disable it:

```js
ball.ondragstart = function() {
  return false;
};
```

Now everything will be all right.

```online
In action:

[iframe src=&quot;ball2&quot; height=230]
```

Another important aspect -- we track `mousemove` on `document`, not on `ball`. From the first sight it may seem that the mouse is always over the ball, and we can put `mousemove` on it.

But as we remember, `mousemove` triggers often, but not for every pixel. So after swift move the pointer can jump from the ball somewhere in the middle of document (or even outside of the window).

So we should listen on `document` to catch it.

## Correct positioning

In the examples above the ball is always moved so, that it&#39;s center is under the pointer:

```js
ball.style.left = pageX - ball.offsetWidth / 2 + &#39;px&#39;;
ball.style.top = pageY - ball.offsetHeight / 2 + &#39;px&#39;;
```

Not bad, but there&#39;s a side-effect. To initiate the drag&#39;n&#39;drop, we can `mousedown` anywhere on the ball. But if &quot;take&quot; it from its edge, then the ball suddenly &quot;jumps&quot; to become centered under the mouse pointer.

It would be better if we keep the initial shift of the element relative to the pointer.

For instance, if we start dragging by the edge of the ball, then the pointer should remain over the edge while dragging.

![](ball_shift.svg)

Let&#39;s update our algorithm:

1. When a visitor presses the button (`mousedown`) - remember the distance from the pointer to the left-upper corner of the ball in variables `shiftX/shiftY`. We&#39;ll keep that distance while dragging.

    To get these shifts we can substract the coordinates:

    ```js
    // onmousedown
    let shiftX = event.clientX - ball.getBoundingClientRect().left;
    let shiftY = event.clientY - ball.getBoundingClientRect().top;
    ```

2. Then while dragging we position the ball on the same shift relative to the pointer, like this:

    ```js
    // onmousemove
    // ball has position:absolute
    ball.style.left = event.pageX - *!*shiftX*/!* + &#39;px&#39;;
    ball.style.top = event.pageY - *!*shiftY*/!* + &#39;px&#39;;
    ```

The final code with better positioning:

```js
ball.onmousedown = function(event) {

*!*
  let shiftX = event.clientX - ball.getBoundingClientRect().left;
  let shiftY = event.clientY - ball.getBoundingClientRect().top;
*/!*

  ball.style.position = &#39;absolute&#39;;
  ball.style.zIndex = 1000;
  document.body.append(ball);

  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);

  // moves the ball at (pageX, pageY) coordinates
  // taking initial shifts into account
  function moveAt(pageX, pageY) {
    ball.style.left = pageX - *!*shiftX*/!* + &#39;px&#39;;
    ball.style.top = pageY - *!*shiftY*/!* + &#39;px&#39;;
  }

  function onMouseMove(event) {
    moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);
  }

  // move the ball on mousemove
  document.addEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, onMouseMove);

  // drop the ball, remove unneeded handlers
  ball.onmouseup = function() {
    document.removeEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, onMouseMove);
    ball.onmouseup = null;
  };

};

ball.ondragstart = function() {
  return false;
};
```

```online
In action (inside `&lt;iframe&gt;`):

[iframe src=&quot;ball3&quot; height=230]
```

The difference is especially noticeable if we drag the ball by its right-bottom corner. In the previous example the ball &quot;jumps&quot; under the pointer. Now it fluently follows the pointer from the current position.

## Potential drop targets (droppables)

In previous examples the ball could be dropped just &quot;anywhere&quot; to stay. In real-life we usually take one element and drop it onto another. For instance, a &quot;file&quot; into a &quot;folder&quot; or something else.

Speaking abstract, we take a &quot;draggable&quot; element and drop it onto &quot;droppable&quot; element.

We need to know:
- where the element was dropped at the end of Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop -- to do the corresponding action,
- and, preferably, know the droppable we&#39;re dragging over, to highlight it.

The solution is kind-of interesting and just a little bit tricky, so let&#39;s cover it here.

What may be the first idea? Probably to set `mouseover/mouseup` handlers on potential droppables?

But that doesn&#39;t work.

The problem is that, while we&#39;re dragging, the draggable element is always above other elements. And mouse events only happen on the top element, not on those below it.

For instance, below are two `&lt;div&gt;` elements, red one on top of the blue one (fully covers). There&#39;s no way to catch an event on the blue one, because the red is on top:

```html run autorun height=60
&lt;style&gt;
  div {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:blue&quot; onmouseover=&quot;alert(&#39;never works&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:red&quot; onmouseover=&quot;alert(&#39;over red!&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

The same with a draggable element. The ball is always on top over other elements, so events happen on it. Whatever handlers we set on lower elements, they won&#39;t work.

That&#39;s why the initial idea to put handlers on potential droppables doesn&#39;t work in practice. They won&#39;t run.

So, what to do?

There&#39;s a method called `document.elementFromPoint(clientX, clientY)`. It returns the most nested element on given window-relative coordinates (or `null` if given coordinates are out of the window).

We can use it in any of our mouse event handlers to detect the potential droppable under the pointer, like this:

```js
// in a mouse event handler
ball.hidden = true; // (*) hide the element that we drag

let elemBelow = document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX, event.clientY);
// elemBelow is the element below the ball, may be droppable

ball.hidden = false;
```

Please note: we need to hide the ball before the call `(*)`. Otherwise we&#39;ll usually have a ball on these coordinates, as it&#39;s the top element under the pointer: `elemBelow=ball`. So we hide it and immediately show again.

We can use that code to check what element we&#39;re &quot;flying over&quot; at any time. And handle the drop when it happens.

An extended code of `onMouseMove` to find &quot;droppable&quot; elements:

```js
// potential droppable that we&#39;re flying over right now
let currentDroppable = null;

function onMouseMove(event) {
  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);

  ball.hidden = true;
  let elemBelow = document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX, event.clientY);
  ball.hidden = false;

  // mousemove events may trigger out of the window (when the ball is dragged off-screen)
  // if clientX/clientY are out of the window, then elementFromPoint returns null
  if (!elemBelow) return;

  // potential droppables are labeled with the class &quot;droppable&quot; (can be other logic)
  let droppableBelow = elemBelow.closest(&#39;.droppable&#39;);

  if (currentDroppable != droppableBelow) {
    // we&#39;re flying in or out...
    // note: both values can be null
    //   currentDroppable=null if we were not over a droppable before this event (e.g over an empty space)
    //   droppableBelow=null if we&#39;re not over a droppable now, during this event

    if (currentDroppable) {
      // the logic to process &quot;flying out&quot; of the droppable (remove highlight)
      leaveDroppable(currentDroppable);
    }
    currentDroppable = droppableBelow;
    if (currentDroppable) {
      // the logic to process &quot;flying in&quot; of the droppable
      enterDroppable(currentDroppable);
    }
  }
}
```

In the example below when the ball is dragged over the soccer goal, the goal is highlighted.

[codetabs height=250 src=&quot;ball4&quot;]

Now we have the current &quot;drop target&quot;, that we&#39;re flying over, in the variable `currentDroppable` during the whole process and can use it to highlight or any other stuff.

## Summary

We considered a basic Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop algorithm.

The key components:

1. Events flow: `ball.mousedown` -&gt; `document.mousemove` -&gt; `ball.mouseup` (don&#39;t forget to cancel native `ondragstart`).
2. At the drag start -- remember the initial shift of the pointer relative to the element: `shiftX/shiftY` and keep it during the dragging.
3. Detect droppable elements under the pointer using `document.elementFromPoint`.

We can lay a lot on this foundation.

- On `mouseup` we can intellectually finalize the drop: change data, move elements around.
- We can highlight the elements we&#39;re flying over.
- We can limit dragging by a certain area or direction.
- We can use event delegation for `mousedown/up`. A large-area event handler that checks  `event.target` can manage Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop for hundreds of elements.
- And so on.

There are frameworks that build architecture over it: `DragZone`, `Droppable`, `Draggable` and other classes. Most of them do the similar stuff to what&#39;s described above, so it should be easy to understand them now. Or roll your own, as you can see that that&#39;s easy enough to do, sometimes easier than adapting a third-party solution.
# Pointer events

Pointer events are a modern way to handle input from a variety of pointing devices, such as a mouse, a pen/stylus, a touchscreen, and so on.

## The brief history

Let&#39;s make a small overview, so that you understand the general picture and the place of Pointer Events among other event types.

- Long ago, in the past, there were only mouse events.

    Then touch devices became widespread, phones and tablets in particular. For the existing scripts to work, they generated (and still generate) mouse events. For instance, tapping a touchscreen generates `mousedown`. So touch devices worked well with web pages.

    But touch devices have more capabilities than a mouse. For example, it&#39;s possible to touch multiple points at once (&quot;multi-touch&quot;). Although, mouse events don&#39;t have necessary properties to handle such multi-touches.

- So touch events were introduced, such as `touchstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove`, that have touch-specific properties (we don&#39;t cover them in detail here, because pointer events are even better).

    Still, it wasn&#39;t enough, as there are many other devices, such as pens, that have their own features. Also, writing code that listens for both touch and mouse events was cumbersome.

- To solve these issues, the new standard Pointer Events was introduced. It provides a single set of events for all kinds of pointing devices.

As of now, [Pointer Events Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/) specification is supported in all major browsers, while the newer [Pointer Events Level 3](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/) is in the works and is mostly compartible with Pointer Events level 2.

Unless you develop for old browsers, such as Internet Explorer 10, or for Safari 12 or below, there&#39;s no point in using mouse or touch events any more -- we can switch to pointer events.

Then your code will work well with both touch and mouse devices.

That said, there are some important peculiarities that one should know in order to use Pointer Events correctly and avoid surprises. We&#39;ll make note of them in this article.

## Pointer event types

Pointer events are named similarly to mouse events:

| Pointer event | Similar mouse event |
|---------------|-------------|
| `pointerdown` | `mousedown` |
| `pointerup` | `mouseup` |
| `pointermove` | `mousemove` |
| `pointerover` | `mouseover` |
| `pointerout` | `mouseout` |
| `pointerenter` | `mouseenter` |
| `pointerleave` | `mouseleave` |
| `pointercancel` | - |
| `gotpointercapture` | - |
| `lostpointercapture` | - |

As we can see, for every `mouse&lt;event&gt;`, there&#39;s a `pointer&lt;event&gt;` that plays a similar role. Also there are 3 additional pointer events that don&#39;t have a corresponding `mouse...` counterpart, we&#39;ll explain them soon.

```smart header=&quot;Replacing `mouse&lt;event&gt;` with `pointer&lt;event&gt;` in our code&quot;
We can replace `mouse&lt;event&gt;` events with `pointer&lt;event&gt;` in our code and expect things to continue working fine with mouse.

The support for touch devices will also &quot;magically&quot; improve. Although, we may need to add `touch-action: none` in some places in CSS. We&#39;ll cover it below in the section about `pointercancel`.
```

## Pointer event properties

Pointer events have the same properties as mouse events, such as `clientX/Y`, `target`, etc., plus some others:

- `pointerId` - the unique identifier of the pointer causing the event.

    Browser-generated. Allows us to handle multiple pointers, such as a touchscreen with stylus and multi-touch (examples will follow).
- `pointerType` - the pointing device type. Must be a string, one of: &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;pen&quot; or &quot;touch&quot;.

    We can use this property to react differently on various pointer types.
- `isPrimary` - is `true` for the primary pointer (the first finger in multi-touch).

Some pointer devices measure contact area and pressure, e.g. for a finger on the touchscreen, there are additional properties for that:

- `width` - the width of the area where the pointer (e.g. a finger) touches the device. Where unsupported, e.g. for a mouse, it&#39;s always `1`.
- `height` - the height of the area where the pointer touches the device. Where unsupported, it&#39;s always `1`.
- `pressure` - the pressure of the pointer tip, in range from 0 to 1. For devices that don&#39;t support pressure must be either `0.5` (pressed) or `0`.
- `tangentialPressure` - the normalized tangential pressure.
- `tiltX`, `tiltY`, `twist` - pen-specific properties that describe how the pen is positioned relative the surface.

These properties aren&#39;t supported by most devices, so they are rarely used. You can find the details about them in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointerevent-interface) if needed.

## Multi-touch

One of the things that mouse events totally don&#39;t support is multi-touch: a user can touch in several places at once on their phone or tablet, or perform special gestures.

Pointer Events allow handling multi-touch with the help of the `pointerId` and `isPrimary` properties.

Here&#39;s what happens when a user touches a touchscreen in one place, then puts another finger somewhere else on it:

1. At the first finger touch:
    - `pointerdown` with `isPrimary=true` and some `pointerId`.
2. For the second finger and more fingers (assuming the first one is still touching):
    - `pointerdown` with `isPrimary=false` and a different `pointerId` for every finger.

Please note: the `pointerId` is assigned not to the whole device, but for each touching finger. If we use 5 fingers to simultaneously touch the screen, we have 5 `pointerdown` events, each with their respective coordinates and a different `pointerId`.

The events associated with the first finger always have `isPrimary=true`.

We can track multiple touching fingers using their `pointerId`. When the user moves and then removes a finger, we get `pointermove` and `pointerup` events with the same `pointerId` as we had in `pointerdown`.

```online
Here&#39;s the demo that logs `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events:

[iframe src=&quot;multitouch&quot; edit height=200]

Please note: you must be using a touchscreen device, such as a phone or a tablet, to actually see the difference in `pointerId/isPrimary`. For single-touch devices, such as a mouse, there&#39;ll be always same `pointerId` with `isPrimary=true`, for all pointer events.
```

## Event: pointercancel

The `pointercancel` event fires when there&#39;s an ongoing pointer interaction, and then something happens that causes it to be aborted, so that no more pointer events are generated.

Such causes are:
- The pointer device hardware was physically disabled.
- The device orientation changed (tablet rotated).
- The browser decided to handle the interaction on its own, considering it a mouse gesture or zoom-and-pan action or something else.

We&#39;ll demonstrate `pointercancel` on a practical example to see how it affects us.

Let&#39;s say we&#39;re impelementing drag&#39;n&#39;drop for a ball, just as in the beginning of the article &lt;info:mouse-drag-and-drop&gt;.

Here is the flow of user actions and the corresponding events:

1) The user presses on an image, to start dragging
    - `pointerdown` event fires
2) Then they start moving the pointer (thus dragging the image)
    - `pointermove` fires, maybe several times
3) And then the surprise happens! The browser has native drag&#39;n&#39;drop support for images, that kicks in and takes over the drag&#39;n&#39;drop process, thus generating `pointercancel` event.
    - The browser now handles drag&#39;n&#39;drop of the image on its own. The user may even drag the ball image out of the browser, into their Mail program or a File Manager.
    - No more `pointermove` events for us.

So the issue is that the browser &quot;hijacks&quot; the interaction: `pointercancel` fires in the beginning of the &quot;drag-and-drop&quot; process, and no more `pointermove` events are generated.

```online
Here&#39;s the drag&#39;n&#39;drop demo with loggin of pointer events (only `up/down`, `move` and `cancel`) in the `textarea`:

[iframe src=&quot;ball&quot; height=240 edit]
```

We&#39;d like to implement the drag&#39;n&#39;drop on our own, so let&#39;s tell the browser not to take it over.

**Prevent the default browser action to avoid `pointercancel`.**

We need to do two things:

1. Prevent native drag&#39;n&#39;drop from happening:
    - We can do this by setting `ball.ondragstart = () =&gt; false`, just as described in the article &lt;info:mouse-drag-and-drop&gt;.
    - That works well for mouse events.
2. For touch devices, there are other touch-related browser actions (besides drag&#39;n&#39;drop). To avoid problems with them too:
    - Prevent them by setting `#ball { touch-action: none }` in CSS.
    - Then our code will start working on touch devices.

After we do that, the events will work as intended, the browser won&#39;t hijack the process and doesn&#39;t emit `pointercancel`.

```online
This demo adds these lines:

[iframe src=&quot;ball-2&quot; height=240 edit]

As you can see, there&#39;s no `pointercancel` any more.
```

Now we can add the code to actually move the ball, and our drag&#39;n&#39;drop will work for mouse devices and touch devices.

## Pointer capturing

Pointer capturing is a special feature of pointer events.

The idea is very simple, but may seem quite odd at first, as nothing like that exists for any other event type.

The main method is:
- `elem.setPointerCapture(pointerId)` - binds events with the given `pointerId` to `elem`. After the call all pointer events with the same `pointerId` will have `elem` as the target (as if happened on `elem`), no matter where in document they really happened.

In other words, `elem.setPointerCapture(pointerId)` retargets all subsequent events with the given `pointerId` to `elem`.

The binding is removed:
- automatically when `pointerup` or `pointercancel` events occur,
- automatically when `elem` is removed from the document,
- when `elem.releasePointerCapture(pointerId)` is called.

**Pointer capturing can be used to simplify drag&#39;n&#39;drop kind of interactions.**

As an example, let&#39;s recall how one can implement a custom slider, described in the &lt;info:mouse-drag-and-drop&gt;.

We make a slider element with the strip and the &quot;runner&quot; (`thumb`) inside it.

Then it works like this:

1. The user presses on the slider `thumb` - `pointerdown` triggers.
2. Then they move the pointer - `pointermove` triggers, and we move the `thumb` along.
    - ...As the pointer moves, it may leave the slider `thumb`: go above or below it. The `thumb` should move strictly horizontally, remaining aligned with the pointer.

So, to track all pointer movements, including when it goes above/below the `thumb`, we had to assign `pointermove` event handler on the whole `document`.

That solution looks a bit &quot;dirty&quot;. One of the problems is that pointer movements around the document may cause side effects, trigger other event handlers, totally not related to the slider.

Pointer capturing provides a means to bind `pointermove` to `thumb` and avoid any such problems:

- We can call `thumb.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId)` in `pointerdown` handler,
- Then future pointer events until `pointerup/cancel` will be retargeted to `thumb`.
- When `pointerup` happens (dragging complete), the binding is removed automatically, we don&#39;t need to care about it.

So, even if the user moves the pointer around the whole document, events handlers will be called on `thumb`. Besides, coordinate properties of the event objects, such as `clientX/clientY` will still be correct - the capturing only affects `target/currentTarget`.

Here&#39;s the essential code:

```js
thumb.onpointerdown = function(event) {
  // retarget all pointer events (until pointerup) to thumb
  thumb.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId);
};

thumb.onpointermove = function(event) {
  // moving the slider: listen on the thumb, as all pointer events are retargeted to it
  let newLeft = event.clientX - slider.getBoundingClientRect().left;
  thumb.style.left = newLeft + &#39;px&#39;;
};

// note: no need to call thumb.releasePointerCapture,
// it happens on pointerup automatically
```

```online
The full demo:

[iframe src=&quot;slider&quot; height=100 edit]
```

At the end, pointer capturing gives us two benefits:
1. The code becomes cleaner as we don&#39;t need to add/remove handlers on the whole `document` any more. The binding is released automatically.
2. If there are any `pointermove` handlers in the document, they won&#39;t be accidentally triggered by the pointer while the user is dragging the slider.

### Pointer capturing events

There are two associated pointer events:

- `gotpointercapture` fires when an element uses `setPointerCapture` to enable capturing.
- `lostpointercapture` fires when the capture is released: either explicitly with `releasePointerCapture` call, or automatically on `pointerup`/`pointercancel`.

## Summary

Pointer events allow handling mouse, touch and pen events simultaneously, with a single piece of code.

Pointer events extend mouse events. We can replace `mouse` with `pointer` in event names and expect our code to continue working for mouse, with better support for other device types.

For drag&#39;n&#39;drops and complex touch interactions that the browser may decide to hijack and handle on its own - remember to cancel the default action on events and set `touch-events: none` in CSS for elements that we engage.

Additional abilities of pointer events are:

- Multi-touch support using `pointerId` and `isPrimary`.
- Device-specific properties, such as `pressure`, `width/height`, and others.
- Pointer capturing: we can retarget all pointer events to a specific element until `pointerup`/`pointercancel`.

As of now, pointer events are supported in all major browsers, so we can safely switch to them, especially if IE10- and Safari 12- are not needed. And even with those browsers, there are polyfills that enable the support of pointer events.
# Keyboard: keydown and keyup

Before we get to keyboard, please note that on modern devices there are other ways to &quot;input something&quot;. For instance, people use speech recognition (especially on mobile devices) or copy/paste with the mouse.

So if we want to track any input into an `&lt;input&gt;` field, then keyboard events are not enough. There&#39;s another event named `input` to track changes of an `&lt;input&gt;` field, by any means. And it may be a better choice for such task. We&#39;ll cover it later in the chapter &lt;info:events-change-input&gt;.

Keyboard events should be used when we want to handle keyboard actions (virtual keyboard also counts). For instance, to react on arrow keys `key:Up` and `key:Down` or hotkeys (including combinations of keys).


## Teststand [#keyboard-test-stand]

```

```online
To better understand keyboard events, you can use the teststand below.

Try different key combinations in the text field.

[codetabs src=&quot;keyboard-dump&quot; height=480]
```


## Keydown and keyup

The `keydown` events happens when a key is pressed down, and then `keyup` -- when it&#39;s released.

### event.code and event.key

The `key` property of the event object allows to get the character, while the `code` property of the event object allows to get the &quot;physical key code&quot;.

For instance, the same key `key:Z` can be pressed with or without `key:Shift`. That gives us two different characters: lowercase `z` and uppercase `Z`.

The `event.key` is exactly the character, and it will be different. But `event.code` is the same:

| Key          | `event.key` | `event.code` |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `key:Z`      |`z` (lowercase)         |`KeyZ`        |
| `key:Shift+Z`|`Z` (uppercase)          |`KeyZ`        |


If a user works with different languages, then switching to another language would make a totally different character instead of `&quot;Z&quot;`. That will become the value of `event.key`, while `event.code` is always the same: `&quot;KeyZ&quot;`.

```smart header=&quot;\&quot;KeyZ\&quot; and other key codes&quot;
Every key has the code that depends on its location on the keyboard. Key codes described in the [UI Events code specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).

For instance:
- Letter keys have codes `&quot;Key&lt;letter&gt;&quot;`: `&quot;KeyA&quot;`, `&quot;KeyB&quot;` etc.
- Digit keys have codes: `&quot;Digit&lt;number&gt;&quot;`: `&quot;Digit0&quot;`, `&quot;Digit1&quot;` etc.
- Special keys are coded by their names: `&quot;Enter&quot;`, `&quot;Backspace&quot;`, `&quot;Tab&quot;` etc.

There are several widespread keyboard layouts, and the specification gives key codes for each of them.

Read the [alphanumeric section of the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#key-alphanumeric-section) for more codes, or just press a key in the [teststand](#keyboard-test-stand) above.
```

```warn header=&quot;Case matters: `\&quot;KeyZ\&quot;`, not `\&quot;keyZ\&quot;`&quot;
Seems obvious, but people still make mistakes.

Please evade mistypes: it&#39;s `KeyZ`, not `keyZ`. The check like `event.code==&quot;keyZ&quot;` won&#39;t work: the first letter of `&quot;Key&quot;` must be uppercase.
```

What if a key does not give any character? For instance, `key:Shift` or `key:F1` or others. For those keys, `event.key` is approximately the same as `event.code`:

| Key          | `event.key` | `event.code` |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `key:F1`      |`F1`          |`F1`        |
| `key:Backspace`      |`Backspace`          |`Backspace`        |
| `key:Shift`|`Shift`          |`ShiftRight` or `ShiftLeft`        |

Please note that `event.code` specifies exactly which key is pressed. For instance, most keyboards have two `key:Shift` keys: on the left and on the right side. The `event.code` tells us exactly which one was pressed, and `event.key` is responsible for the &quot;meaning&quot; of the key: what it is (a &quot;Shift&quot;).

Let&#39;s say, we want to handle a hotkey: `key:Ctrl+Z` (or `key:Cmd+Z` for Mac). Most text editors hook the &quot;Undo&quot; action on it. We can set a listener on `keydown` and check which key is pressed.

There&#39;s a dilemma here: in such a listener, should we check the value of `event.key` or `event.code`?

On one hand, the value of `event.key` is a character, it changes depending on the language. If the visitor has several languages in OS and switches between them, the same key gives different characters. So it makes sense to check `event.code`, it&#39;s always the same.

Like this:

```js run
document.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;, function(event) {
  if (event.code == &#39;KeyZ&#39; &amp;&amp; (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey)) {
    alert(&#39;Undo!&#39;)
  }
});
```

On the other hand, there&#39;s a problem with `event.code`. For different keyboard layouts, the same key may have different characters.

For example, here are US layout (&quot;QWERTY&quot;) and German layout (&quot;QWERTZ&quot;) under it (from Wikipedia):

![](us-layout.svg)

![](german-layout.svg)

For the same key, US layout has &quot;Z&quot;, while German layout has &quot;Y&quot; (letters are swapped).

Literally, `event.code` will equal `KeyZ` for people with German layout when they press `key:Y`.

If we check `event.code == &#39;KeyZ&#39;` in our code, then for people with German layout such test will pass when they press `key:Y`.

That sounds really odd, but so it is. The [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#table-key-code-alphanumeric-writing-system) explicitly mentions such behavior.

So, `event.code` may match a wrong character for unexpected layout. Same letters in different layouts may map to different physical keys, leading to different codes. Luckily, that happens only with several codes, e.g. `keyA`, `keyQ`, `keyZ` (as we&#39;ve seen), and doesn&#39;t happen with special keys such as `Shift`. You can find the list in the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#table-key-code-alphanumeric-writing-system).

To reliably track layout-dependent characters, `event.key` may be a better way.

On the other hand, `event.code` has the benefit of staying always the same, bound to the physical key location, even if the visitor changes languages. So hotkeys that rely on it work well even in case of a language switch.

Do we want to handle layout-dependant keys? Then `event.key` is the way to go.

Or we want a hotkey to work even after a language switch? Then `event.code` may be better.

## Auto-repeat

If a key is being pressed for a long enough time, it starts to &quot;auto-repeat&quot;: the `keydown` triggers again and again, and then when it&#39;s released we finally get `keyup`. So it&#39;s kind of normal to have many `keydown` and a single `keyup`.

For events triggered by auto-repeat, the event object has `event.repeat` property set to `true`.


## Default actions

Default actions vary, as there are many possible things that may be initiated by the keyboard.

For instance:

- A character appears on the screen (the most obvious outcome).
- A character is deleted (`key:Delete` key).
- The page is scrolled (`key:PageDown` key).
- The browser opens the &quot;Save Page&quot; dialog (`key:Ctrl+S`)
-  ...and so on.

Preventing the default action on `keydown` can cancel most of them, with the exception of OS-based special keys. For instance, on Windows `key:Alt+F4` closes the current browser window. And there&#39;s no way to stop it by preventing the default action in JavaScript.

For instance, the `&lt;input&gt;` below expects a phone number, so it does not accept keys except digits, `+`, `()` or `-`:

```html autorun height=60 run
&lt;script&gt;
function checkPhoneKey(key) {
  return (key &gt;= &#39;0&#39; &amp;&amp; key &lt;= &#39;9&#39;) || key == &#39;+&#39; || key == &#39;(&#39; || key == &#39;)&#39; || key == &#39;-&#39;;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input *!*onkeydown=&quot;return checkPhoneKey(event.key)&quot;*/!* placeholder=&quot;Phone, please&quot; type=&quot;tel&quot;&gt;
```

Please note that special keys, such as `key:Backspace`, `key:Left`, `key:Right`, `key:Ctrl+V`, do not work in the input. That&#39;s a side-effect of the strict filter `checkPhoneKey`.

Let&#39;s relax it a little bit:


```html autorun height=60 run
&lt;script&gt;
function checkPhoneKey(key) {
  return (key &gt;= &#39;0&#39; &amp;&amp; key &lt;= &#39;9&#39;) || key == &#39;+&#39; || key == &#39;(&#39; || key == &#39;)&#39; || key == &#39;-&#39; ||
    key == &#39;ArrowLeft&#39; || key == &#39;ArrowRight&#39; || key == &#39;Delete&#39; || key == &#39;Backspace&#39;;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input onkeydown=&quot;return checkPhoneKey(event.key)&quot; placeholder=&quot;Phone, please&quot; type=&quot;tel&quot;&gt;
```

Now arrows and deletion works well.

...But we still can enter anything by using a mouse and right-click + Paste. So the filter is not 100% reliable. We can just let it be like that, because most of time it works. Or an alternative approach would be to track the `input` event -- it triggers after any modification. There we can check the new value and highlight/modify it when it&#39;s invalid.

## Legacy

In the past, there was a `keypress` event, and also `keyCode`, `charCode`, `which` properties of the event object.

There were so many browser incompatibilities while working with them, that developers of the specification had no way, other than deprecating all of them and creating new, modern events (described above in this chapter). The old code still works, as browsers keep supporting them, but there&#39;s totally no need to use those any more.

## Mobile Keyboards

When using virtual/mobile keyboards, formally known as IME (Input-Method Editor), the W3C standard states that a KeyboardEvent&#39;s [`e.keyCode` should be `229`](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#determine-keydown-keyup-keyCode) and [`e.key` should be `&quot;Unidentified&quot;`](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-attr-values).

While some of these keyboards might still use the right values for `e.key`, `e.code`, `e.keyCode`... when pressing certain keys such as arrows or backspace, there&#39;s no guarantee, so your keyboard logic might not always work on mobile devices.

## Summary

Pressing a key always generates a keyboard event, be it symbol keys or special keys like `key:Shift` or `key:Ctrl` and so on. The only exception is `key:Fn` key that sometimes presents on a laptop keyboard. There&#39;s no keyboard event for it, because it&#39;s often implemented on lower level than OS.

Keyboard events:

- `keydown` -- on pressing the key (auto-repeats if the key is pressed for long),
- `keyup` -- on releasing the key.

Main keyboard event properties:

- `code` -- the &quot;key code&quot; (`&quot;KeyA&quot;`, `&quot;ArrowLeft&quot;` and so on), specific to the physical location of the key on keyboard.
- `key` -- the character (`&quot;A&quot;`, `&quot;a&quot;` and so on), for non-character keys, such as `key:Esc`, usually has the same value  as `code`.

In the past, keyboard events were sometimes used to track user input in form fields. That&#39;s not reliable, because the input can come from various sources. We have `input` and `change` events to handle any input (covered later in the chapter &lt;info:events-change-input&gt;). They trigger after any kind of input, including copy-pasting or speech recognition.

We should use keyboard events when we really want keyboard. For example, to react on hotkeys or special keys.
# Scrolling

The `scroll` event allows reacting to a page or element scrolling. There are quite a few good things we can do here.

For instance:
- Show/hide additional controls or information depending on where in the document the user is.
- Load more data when the user scrolls down till the end of the page.

Here&#39;s a small function to show the current scroll:

```js autorun
window.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, function() {
  document.getElementById(&#39;showScroll&#39;).innerHTML = window.pageYOffset + &#39;px&#39;;
});
```

```online
In action:

Current scroll = &lt;b id=&quot;showScroll&quot;&gt;scroll the window&lt;/b&gt;
```

The `scroll` event works both on the `window` and on scrollable elements.

## Prevent scrolling

How do we make something unscrollable?

We can&#39;t prevent scrolling by using `event.preventDefault()` in `onscroll` listener, because it triggers *after* the scroll has already happened.

But we can prevent scrolling by `event.preventDefault()` on an event that causes the scroll, for instance `keydown` event for `key:pageUp` and `key:pageDown`.

If we add an event handler to these events and `event.preventDefault()` in it, then the scroll won&#39;t start.

There are many ways to initiate a scroll, so it&#39;s more reliable to use CSS, `overflow` property.

Here are few tasks that you can solve or look through to see applications of `onscroll`.
# Form properties and methods

Forms and control elements, such as `&lt;input&gt;` have a lot of special properties and events.

Working with forms will be much more convenient when we learn them.

## Navigation: form and elements

Document forms are members of the special collection `document.forms`.

That&#39;s a so-called *&quot;named collection&quot;*: it&#39;s both named and ordered. We can use both the name or the number in the document to get the form.

```js no-beautify
document.forms.my; // the form with name=&quot;my&quot;
document.forms[0]; // the first form in the document
```

When we have a form, then any element is available in the named collection `form.elements`.

For instance:

```html run height=40
&lt;form name=&quot;my&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;one&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;two&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  // get the form
  let form = document.forms.my; // &lt;form name=&quot;my&quot;&gt; element

  // get the element
  let elem = form.elements.one; // &lt;input name=&quot;one&quot;&gt; element

  alert(elem.value); // 1
&lt;/script&gt;
```

There may be multiple elements with the same name. This is typical with radio buttons and checkboxes.

In that case, `form.elements[name]` is a *collection*. For instance:

```html run height=40
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; *!*name=&quot;age&quot;*/!* value=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; *!*name=&quot;age&quot;*/!* value=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
let form = document.forms[0];

let ageElems = form.elements.age;

*!*
alert(ageElems[0]); // [object HTMLInputElement]
*/!*
&lt;/script&gt;
```

These navigation properties do not depend on the tag structure. All control elements, no matter how deep they are in the form, are available in `form.elements`.


````smart header=&quot;Fieldsets as \&quot;subforms\&quot;&quot;
A form may have one or many `&lt;fieldset&gt;` elements inside it. They also have `elements` property that lists form controls inside them.

For instance:

```html run height=80
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;form id=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fieldset name=&quot;userFields&quot;&gt;
      &lt;legend&gt;info&lt;/legend&gt;
      &lt;input name=&quot;login&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;
    alert(form.elements.login); // &lt;input name=&quot;login&quot;&gt;

*!*
    let fieldset = form.elements.userFields;
    alert(fieldset); // HTMLFieldSetElement

    // we can get the input by name both from the form and from the fieldset
    alert(fieldset.elements.login == form.elements.login); // true
*/!*
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

<p>```<code>warn header="Shorter notation:</code>form.name<code>" There's a shorter notation: we can access the element as</code>form[index/name]`.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of <code>form.elements.login</code> we can write <code>form.login</code>.</p>
<p>That also works, but there’s a minor issue: if we access an element, and then change its <code>name</code>, then it is still available under the old name (as well as under the new one).</p>
<p>That’s easy to see in an example:</p>
```html run height=40
<form id="form">
<input name="login" />
</form>
<script>
    alert(form.elements.login == form.login); // true, the same <input>

    form.login.name = "username"; // change the name of the input

    // form.elements updated the name:
    alert(form.elements.login); // undefined
    alert(form.elements.username); // input

  *!*
    // form allows both names: the new one and the old one
    alert(form.username == form.login); // true

That&#39;s usually not a problem, however, because we rarely change names of form elements.

<h2 id="backreference-element.form">Backreference: element.form</h2>
<p>For any element, the form is available as <code>element.form</code>. So a form references all elements, and elements reference the form.</p>

<p><img src="form-navigation.svg" /></p>
<p>For instance:</p>
```html run height=40
<form id="form">

<h2 id="form-elements">Form elements</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about form controls.</p>
<h3 id="input-and-textarea">input and textarea</h3>
<p>We can access their value as <code>input.value</code> (string) or <code>input.checked</code> (boolean) for checkboxes.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-1" title="1"><span class="va">input</span>.<span class="at">value</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;New value&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-2" title="2"><span class="va">textarea</span>.<span class="at">value</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;New text&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-4" title="4"><span class="va">input</span>.<span class="at">checked</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">true</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// for a checkbox or radio button</span></a></code></pre></div>
``<code>warn header="Use</code>textarea.value<code>, not</code>textarea.innerHTML<code>" Please note that even though</code>
<textarea>
…
</textarea>
<p><code>holds its value as nested HTML, we should never use</code>textarea.innerHTML` to access it.</p>
<p>It stores only the HTML that was initially on the page, not the current value. ```</p>
<h3 id="select-and-option">select and option</h3>
<p>A <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element has 3 important properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>select.options</code> – the collection of <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> subelements,</li>
<li><code>select.value</code> – the <em>value</em> of the currently selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>,</li>
<li><code>select.selectedIndex</code> – the <em>number</em> of the currently selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>They provide three different ways of setting a value for a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the corresponding <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element (e.g. among <code>select.options</code>) and set its <code>option.selected</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>If we know a new value: set <code>select.value</code> to the new value.</li>
<li>If we know the new option number: set <code>select.selectedIndex</code> to that number.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of all three methods:</p>
<p>```html run <select id="select"> <option value="apple">Apple</option> <option value="pear">Pear</option> <option value="banana">Banana</option> </select></p>
<script>
  // all three lines do the same thing
  select.options[2].selected = true;
  select.selectedIndex = 2;
  select.value = 'banana';
  // please note: options start from zero, so index 2 means the 3rd option.
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Unlike most other controls, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> allows to select multiple options at once if it has <code>multiple</code> attribute. This attribute is rarely used, though.</p>
<p>For multiple selected values, use the first way of setting values: add/remove the <code>selected</code> property from <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> subelements.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to get selected values from a multi-select:</p>
<p>```html run &lt;select id=“select” <em>!</em>multiple<em>/!</em>&gt; <option value="blues" selected>Blues</option> <option value="rock" selected>Rock</option> <option value="classic">Classic</option> </select></p>
<script>
  // get all selected values from multi-select
  let selected = Array.from(select.options)
    .filter(option => option.selected)
    .map(option => option.value);

  alert(selected); // blues,rock
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>The full specification of the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element is available in the specification <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-select-element" class="uri">https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-select-element</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-option">new Option</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-option-element">specification</a> there’s a nice short syntax to create an <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb36-1" title="1">option <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">Option</span>(text<span class="op">,</span> value<span class="op">,</span> defaultSelected<span class="op">,</span> selected)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This syntax is optional. We can use <code>document.createElement('option')</code> and set attributes manually. Still, it may be shorter, so here are the parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>text</code> – the text inside the option,</li>
<li><code>value</code> – the option value,</li>
<li><code>defaultSelected</code> – if <code>true</code>, then <code>selected</code> HTML-attribute is created,</li>
<li><code>selected</code> – if <code>true</code>, then the option is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between <code>defaultSelected</code> and <code>selected</code> is that <code>defaultSelected</code> sets the HTML-attribute (that we can get using <code>option.getAttribute('selected')</code>, while <code>selected</code> sets whether the option is selected or not.</p>
<p>In practice, one should usually set <em>both</em> values to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. (Or, simply omit them; both default to <code>false</code>.)</p>
<p>For instance, here’s a new “unselected” option:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> option <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">Option</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Text&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-2" title="2"><span class="co">// creates &lt;option value=&quot;value&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/option&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The same option, but selected:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb38-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> option <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">Option</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Text&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">true</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">true</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Option elements have properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>option.selected</code></dt>
<dd>Is the option selected.
</dd>
<dt><code>option.index</code></dt>
<dd>The number of the option among the others in its <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>option.text</code></dt>
<dd>Text content of the option (seen by the visitor).

<p>For <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, one can also get the value by the index <code>select.selectedIndex</code> or through the options collection <code>select.options</code>.</p>
<p>These are the basics to start working with forms. We’ll meet many examples further in the tutorial.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we’ll cover <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events that may occur on any element, but are mostly handled on forms. # Focusing: focus/blur</p>
<p>An element receives the focus when the user either clicks on it or uses the <code>key:Tab</code> key on the keyboard. There’s also an <code>autofocus</code> HTML attribute that puts the focus onto an element by default when a page loads and other means of getting the focus.</p>
<p>Focusing on an element generally means: “prepare to accept the data here”, so that’s the moment when we can run the code to initialize the required functionality.</p>
<p>The moment of losing the focus (“blur”) can be even more important. That’s when a user clicks somewhere else or presses <code>key:Tab</code> to go to the next form field, or there are other means as well.</p>
<p>Losing the focus generally means: “the data has been entered”, so we can run the code to check it or even to save it to the server and so on.</p>
<p>There are important peculiarities when working with focus events. We’ll do the best to cover them further on.</p>
<h2 id="events-focusblur">Events focus/blur</h2>
<p>The <code>focus</code> event is called on focusing, and <code>blur</code> – when the element loses the focus.</p>
<p>Let’s use them for validation of an input field.</p>
<p>In the example below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>blur</code> handler checks if the field has an email entered, and if not – shows an error.</li>
<li>The <code>focus</code> handler hides the error message (on <code>blur</code> it will be checked again):</li>
</ul>
```html run autorun height=60
<style>
  .invalid { border-color: red; }
  #error { color: red }
</style>
<p>Your email please: <input type="email" id="input"></p>
<div id="error">

</div>
<script>
*!*input.onblur*/!* = function() {
  if (!input.value.includes('@')) { // not email
    input.classList.add('invalid');
    error.innerHTML = 'Please enter a correct email.'
  }
};

*!*input.onfocus*/!* = function() {
  if (this.classList.contains('invalid')) {
    // remove the "error" indication, because the user wants to re-enter something
    this.classList.remove('invalid');
    error.innerHTML = "";
  }
};
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Modern HTML allows us to do many validations using input attributes: <code>required</code>, <code>pattern</code> and so on. And sometimes they are just what we need. JavaScript can be used when we want more flexibility. Also we could automatically send the changed value to the server if it’s correct.</p>
<h2 id="methods-focusblur">Methods focus/blur</h2>
<p>Methods <code>elem.focus()</code> and <code>elem.blur()</code> set/unset the focus on the element.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s make the visitor unable to leave the input if the value is invalid:</p>
```html run autorun height=80
<style>
  .error {
    background: red;
  }
</style>
<p>Your email please: <input type="email" id="input"> <input type="text" style="width:220px" placeholder="make email invalid and try to focus here"></p>
<script>
  input.onblur = function() {
    if (!this.value.includes('@')) { // not email
      // show the error
      this.classList.add("error");
*!*
      // ...and put the focus back
      input.focus();
*/!*
    } else {
      this.classList.remove("error");
    }
  };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>It works in all browsers except Firefox (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53579">bug</a>).</p>
<p>If we enter something into the input and then try to use <code>key:Tab</code> or click away from the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, then <code>onblur</code> returns the focus back.</p>
<p>Please note that we can’t “prevent losing focus” by calling <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in <code>onblur</code>, because <code>onblur</code> works <em>after</em> the element lost the focus.</p>
<p>```warn header=“JavaScript-initiated focus loss” A focus loss can occur for many reasons.</p>
<p>One of them is when the visitor clicks somewhere else. But also JavaScript itself may cause it, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>alert</code> moves focus to itself, so it causes the focus loss at the element (<code>blur</code> event), and when the <code>alert</code> is dismissed, the focus comes back (<code>focus</code> event).</li>
<li>If an element is removed from DOM, then it also causes the focus loss. If it is reinserted later, then the focus doesn’t return.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features sometimes cause <code>focus/blur</code> handlers to misbehave – to trigger when they are not needed.</p>
<p>The best recipe is to be careful when using these events. If we want to track user-initiated focus-loss, then we should avoid causing it ourselves. ``` ## Allow focusing on any element: tabindex</p>
<p>By default many elements do not support focusing.</p>
<p>The list varies a bit between browsers, but one thing is always correct: <code>focus/blur</code> support is guaranteed for elements that a visitor can interact with: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, elements that exist to format something, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> – are unfocusable by default. The method <code>elem.focus()</code> doesn’t work on them, and <code>focus/blur</code> events are never triggered.</p>
<p>This can be changed using HTML-attribute <code>tabindex</code>.</p>
<p>Any element becomes focusable if it has <code>tabindex</code>. The value of the attribute is the order number of the element when <code>key:Tab</code> (or something like that) is used to switch between them.</p>
<p>That is: if we have two elements, the first has <code>tabindex="1"</code>, and the second has <code>tabindex="2"</code>, then pressing <code>key:Tab</code> while in the first element – moves the focus into the second one.</p>
<p>The switch order is: elements with <code>tabindex</code> from <code>1</code> and above go first (in the <code>tabindex</code> order), and then elements without <code>tabindex</code> (e.g. a regular <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Elements with matching <code>tabindex</code> are switched in the document source order (the default order).</p>
<p>There are two special values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tabindex="0"</code> puts an element among those without <code>tabindex</code>. That is, when we switch elements, elements with <code>tabindex=0</code> go after elements with <code>tabindex ≥ 1</code>.</p>
<p>Usually it’s used to make an element focusable, but keep the default switching order. To make an element a part of the form on par with <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tabindex="-1"</code> allows only programmatic focusing on an element. The <code>key:Tab</code> key ignores such elements, but method <code>elem.focus()</code> works.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, here’s a list. Click the first item and press <code>key:Tab</code>:</p>
```html autorun no-beautify Click the first item and press Tab. Keep track of the order. Please note that many subsequent Tabs can move the focus out of the iframe in the example.
<ul>
<li tabindex="1">
One
</li>
<li tabindex="0">
Zero
</li>
<li tabindex="2">
Two
</li>
<li tabindex="-1">
Minus one
</li>
</ul>
<style>
  li { cursor: pointer; }
  :focus { outline: 1px dashed green; }
</style>
<p>```</p>
<p>The order is like this: <code>1 - 2 - 0</code>. Normally, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> does not support focusing, but <code>tabindex</code> full enables it, along with events and styling with <code>:focus</code>.</p>
<p><code>smart header="The property `elem.tabIndex` works too" We can add `tabindex` from JavaScript by using the `elem.tabIndex` property. That has the same effect.</code></p>
<h2 id="delegation-focusinfocusout">Delegation: focusin/focusout</h2>
<p>Events <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> do not bubble.</p>
<p>For instance, we can’t put <code>onfocus</code> on the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> to highlight it, like this:</p>
```html autorun height=80 <!-- on focusing in the form -- add the class --> &lt;form <em>!</em>onfocus=“this.className=‘focused’”<em>/!</em>&gt; <input type="text" name="name" value="Name"> <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>
<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>
<p>```</p>
<p>The example above doesn’t work, because when user focuses on an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, the <code>focus</code> event triggers on that input only. It doesn’t bubble up. So <code>form.onfocus</code> never triggers.</p>
<p>There are two solutions.</p>
<p>First, there’s a funny historical feature: <code>focus/blur</code> do not bubble up, but propagate down on the capturing phase.</p>
<p>This will work:</p>
```html autorun height=80
<form id="form">
<input type="text" name="name" value="Name"> <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>
<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>
<script>
*!*
  // put the handler on capturing phase (last argument true)
  form.addEventListener("focus", () => form.classList.add('focused'), true);
  form.addEventListener("blur", () => form.classList.remove('focused'), true);
*/!*
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Second, there are <code>focusin</code> and <code>focusout</code> events – exactly the same as <code>focus/blur</code>, but they bubble.</p>
<p>Note that they must be assigned using <code>elem.addEventListener</code>, not <code>on&lt;event&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>So here’s another working variant:</p>
```html autorun height=80
<form id="form">
<input type="text" name="name" value="Name"> <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>
<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>
<script>
*!*
  form.addEventListener("focusin", () => form.classList.add('focused'));
  form.addEventListener("focusout", () => form.classList.remove('focused'));
*/!*
</script>
<p>```</p>
<h2 id="summary-6">Summary</h2>
<p>Events <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> trigger on an element focusing/losing focus.</p>
<p>Their specials are: - They do not bubble. Can use capturing state instead or <code>focusin/focusout</code>. - Most elements do not support focus by default. Use <code>tabindex</code> to make anything focusable.</p>
<p>The current focused element is available as <code>document.activeElement</code>. # Events: change, input, cut, copy, paste</p>
<p>Let’s cover various events that accompany data updates.</p>
<h2 id="event-change">Event: change</h2>
<p>The <code>change</code> event triggers when the element has finished changing.</p>
<p>For text inputs that means that the event occurs when it loses focus.</p>
<p>For instance, while we are typing in the text field below – there’s no event. But when we move the focus somewhere else, for instance, click on a button – there will be a <code>change</code> event:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=40 run &lt;input type="text" onchange="alert(this.value)"&gt; &lt;input type="button" value="Button"&gt;</code></p>
<p>For other elements: <code>select</code>, <code>input type=checkbox/radio</code> it triggers right after the selection changes:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=40 run &lt;select onchange="alert(this.value)"&gt;   &lt;option value=""&gt;Select something&lt;/option&gt;   &lt;option value="1"&gt;Option 1&lt;/option&gt;   &lt;option value="2"&gt;Option 2&lt;/option&gt;   &lt;option value="3"&gt;Option 3&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="event-input">Event: input</h2>
<p>The <code>input</code> event triggers every time after a value is modified by the user.</p>
<p>Unlike keyboard events, it triggers on any value change, even those that does not involve keyboard actions: pasting with a mouse or using speech recognition to dictate the text.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=40 run &lt;input type="text" id="input"&gt; oninput: &lt;span id="result"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;script&gt;   input.oninput = function() {     result.innerHTML = input.value;   }; &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>If we want to handle every modification of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> then this event is the best choice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>input</code> event doesn’t trigger on keyboard input and other actions that do not involve value change, e.g. pressing arrow keys <code>key:⇦</code> <code>key:⇨</code> while in the input.</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Can't prevent anything in</code>oninput<code>" The</code>input` event occurs after the value is modified.</p>
<p>So we can’t use <code>event.preventDefault()</code> there – it’s just too late, there would be no effect. ```</p>
<h2 id="events-cut-copy-paste">Events: cut, copy, paste</h2>
<p>These events occur on cutting/copying/pasting a value.</p>
<p>They belong to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-event-interfaces">ClipboardEvent</a> class and provide access to the data that is copied/pasted.</p>
<p>We also can use <code>event.preventDefault()</code> to abort the action, then nothing gets copied/pasted.</p>
<p>For instance, the code below prevents all such events and shows what we are trying to cut/copy/paste:</p>
<p><code>html autorun height=40 run &lt;input type="text" id="input"&gt; &lt;script&gt;   input.oncut = input.oncopy = input.onpaste = function(event) {     alert(event.type + ' - ' + event.clipboardData.getData('text/plain'));     return false;   }; &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please note, that it’s possible to copy/paste not just text, but everything. For instance, we can copy a file in the OS file manager, and paste it.</p>
<p>That’s because <code>clipboardData</code> implements <code>DataTransfer</code> interface, commonly used for drag’n’drop and copy/pasting. It’s bit beyound our scope now, but you can find its methods <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#the-datatransfer-interface">in the specification</a>.</p>
<p>``<code>warn header="ClipboardAPI: user safety restrictions" The clipboard is a "global" OS-level thing. So most browsers allow read/write access to the clipboard only in the scope of certain user actions for the safety, e.g. in</code>onclick` event handlers.</p>
<p>Also it’s forbidden to generate “custom” clipboard events with <code>dispatchEvent</code> in all browsers except Firefox. ```</p>

<h1 id="forms-event-and-method-submit">Forms: event and method submit</h1>
<p>The <code>submit</code> event triggers when the form is submitted, it is usually used to validate the form before sending it to the server or to abort the submission and process it in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The method <code>form.submit()</code> allows to initiate form sending from JavaScript. We can use it to dynamically create and send our own forms to server.</p>
<p>Let’s see more details of them.</p>
<h2 id="event-submit">Event: submit</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to submit a form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first – to click <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The second – press <code>key:Enter</code> on an input field.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both actions lead to <code>submit</code> event on the form. The handler can check the data, and if there are errors, show them and call <code>event.preventDefault()</code>, then the form won’t be sent to the server.</p>

## Method: submit

To submit a form to the server manually, we can call `form.submit()`.

Then the `submit` event is not generated. It is assumed that if the programmer calls `form.submit()`, then the script already did all related processing.

Sometimes that&#39;s used to manually create and send a form, like this:

```js run
let form = document.createElement(&quot;form&quot;);
form.action = &quot;https://google.com/search&quot;;
form.method = &quot;GET&quot;;

form.innerHTML = &#39;&lt;input name=&quot;q&quot; value=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&#39;;

// the form must be in the document to submit it
document.body.append(form);

form.submit();
```

# Page: DOMContentLoaded, load, beforeunload, unload

The lifecycle of an HTML page has three important events:

- `DOMContentLoaded` -- the browser fully loaded HTML, and the DOM tree is built, but external resources like pictures `&lt;img&gt;` and stylesheets may not yet have loaded.
- `load` -- not only HTML is loaded, but also all the external resources: images, styles etc.
- `beforeunload/unload` -- the user is leaving the page.

Each event may be useful:

- `DOMContentLoaded` event -- DOM is ready, so the handler can lookup DOM nodes, initialize the interface.
- `load` event -- external resources are loaded, so styles are applied, image sizes are known etc.
- `beforeunload` event -- the user is leaving: we can check if the user saved the changes and ask them whether they really want to leave.
- `unload` -- the user almost left, but we still can initiate some operations, such as sending out statistics.

Let&#39;s explore the details of these events.

## DOMContentLoaded

The `DOMContentLoaded` event happens on the `document` object.

We must use `addEventListener` to catch it:

```js
document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, ready);
// not &quot;document.onDOMContentLoaded = ...&quot;
```

For instance:

```html run height=200 refresh
&lt;script&gt;
    function ready() {
      alert(&#39;DOM is ready&#39;);

      // image is not yet loaded (unless it was cached), so the size is 0x0
      alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
    }

  *!*
    document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, ready);
  */!*
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;img id=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&amp;cache=0&quot; /&gt;
```

In the example the `DOMContentLoaded` handler runs when the document is loaded, so it can see all the elements, including `&lt;img&gt;` below.

But it doesn&#39;t wait for the image to load. So `alert` shows zero sizes.

At first sight, the `DOMContentLoaded` event is very simple. The DOM tree is ready -- here&#39;s the event. There are few peculiarities though.

### DOMContentLoaded and scripts

When the browser processes an HTML-document and comes across a `&lt;script&gt;` tag, it needs to execute before continuing building the DOM. That&#39;s a precaution, as scripts may want to modify DOM, and even `document.write` into it, so `DOMContentLoaded` has to wait.

So DOMContentLoaded definitely happens after such scripts:

```html run
&lt;script&gt;
  document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, () =&gt; {
    alert(&quot;DOM ready!&quot;);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  alert(&quot;Library loaded, inline script executed&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

In the example above, we first see &quot;Library loaded...&quot;, and then &quot;DOM ready!&quot; (all scripts are executed).

```warn header=&quot;Scripts that don&#39;t block DOMContentLoaded&quot;
There are two exceptions from this rule:
1. Scripts with the `async` attribute, that we&#39;ll cover [a bit later](info:script-async-defer), don&#39;t block `DOMContentLoaded`.
2. Scripts that are generated dynamically with `document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;)` and then added to the webpage also don&#39;t block this event.
```

### DOMContentLoaded and styles

External style sheets don&#39;t affect DOM, so `DOMContentLoaded` does not wait for them.

But there&#39;s a pitfall. If we have a script after the style, then that script must wait until the stylesheet loads:

```html run
&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  // the script doesn&#39;t not execute until the stylesheet is loaded
  alert(getComputedStyle(document.body).marginTop);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The reason for this is that the script may want to get coordinates and other style-dependent properties of elements, like in the example above. Naturally, it has to wait for styles to load.

As `DOMContentLoaded` waits for scripts, it now waits for styles before them as well.

### Built-in browser autofill

Firefox, Chrome and Opera autofill forms on `DOMContentLoaded`.

For instance, if the page has a form with login and password, and the browser remembered the values, then on `DOMContentLoaded` it may try to autofill them (if approved by the user).

So if `DOMContentLoaded` is postponed by long-loading scripts, then autofill also awaits. You probably saw that on some sites (if you use browser autofill) -- the login/password fields don&#39;t get autofilled immediately, but there&#39;s a delay till the page fully loads. That&#39;s actually the delay until the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

## window.onload [#window-onload]

The `load` event on the `window` object triggers when the whole page is loaded including styles, images and other resources. This event is available via the `onload` property.

The example below correctly shows image sizes, because `window.onload` waits for all images:

```html run height=200 refresh
&lt;script&gt;
  window.onload = function () {
    // same as window.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;, (event) =&gt; {
    alert(&quot;Page loaded&quot;);

    // image is loaded at this time
    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;img id=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&amp;cache=0&quot; /&gt;
```

## window.onunload

When a visitor leaves the page, the `unload` event triggers on `window`. We can do something there that doesn&#39;t involve a delay, like closing related popup windows.

The notable exception is sending analytics.

Let&#39;s say we gather data about how the page is used: mouse clicks, scrolls, viewed page areas, and so on.

Naturally, `unload` event is when the user leaves us, and we&#39;d like to save the data on our server.

There exists a special `navigator.sendBeacon(url, data)` method for such needs, described in the specification &lt;https://w3c.github.io/beacon/&gt;.

It sends the data in background. The transition to another page is not delayed: the browser leaves the page, but still performs `sendBeacon`.

Here&#39;s how to use it:

```js
let analyticsData = {
  /* object with gathered data */
};

window.addEventListener(&quot;unload&quot;, function () {
  navigator.sendBeacon(&quot;/analytics&quot;, JSON.stringify(analyticsData));
});
```

- The request is sent as POST.
- We can send not only a string, but also forms and other formats, as described in the chapter &lt;info:fetch&gt;, but usually it&#39;s a stringified object.
- The data is limited by 64kb.

When the `sendBeacon` request is finished, the browser probably has already left the document, so there&#39;s no way to get server response (which is usually empty for analytics).

There&#39;s also a `keepalive` flag for doing such &quot;after-page-left&quot; requests in [fetch](info:fetch) method for generic network requests. You can find more information in the chapter &lt;info:fetch-api&gt;.

If we want to cancel the transition to another page, we can&#39;t do it here. But we can use another event -- `onbeforeunload`.

## window.onbeforeunload [#window.onbeforeunload]

If a visitor initiated navigation away from the page or tries to close the window, the `beforeunload` handler asks for additional confirmation.

If we cancel the event, the browser may ask the visitor if they are sure.

You can try it by running this code and then reloading the page:

```js run
window.onbeforeunload = function () {
  return false;
};
```

For historical reasons, returning a non-empty string also counts as canceling the event. Some time ago browsers used to show it as a message, but as the [modern specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#unloading-documents) says, they shouldn&#39;t.

Here&#39;s an example:

```js run
window.onbeforeunload = function () {
  return &quot;There are unsaved changes. Leave now?&quot;;
};
```

The behavior was changed, because some webmasters abused this event handler by showing misleading and annoying messages. So right now old browsers still may show it as a message, but aside of that -- there&#39;s no way to customize the message shown to the user.

## readyState

What happens if we set the `DOMContentLoaded` handler after the document is loaded?

Naturally, it never runs.

There are cases when we are not sure whether the document is ready or not. We&#39;d like our function to execute when the DOM is loaded, be it now or later.

The `document.readyState` property tells us about the current loading state.

There are 3 possible values:

- `&quot;loading&quot;` -- the document is loading.
- `&quot;interactive&quot;` -- the document was fully read.
- `&quot;complete&quot;` -- the document was fully read and all resources (like images) are loaded too.

So we can check `document.readyState` and setup a handler or execute the code immediately if it&#39;s ready.

Like this:

```js
function work() {
  /*...*/
}

if (document.readyState == &quot;loading&quot;) {
  // still loading, wait for the event
  document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, work);
} else {
  // DOM is ready!
  work();
}
```

There&#39;s also the `readystatechange` event that triggers when the state changes, so we can print all these states like this:

```js run
// current state
console.log(document.readyState);

// print state changes
document.addEventListener(&quot;readystatechange&quot;, () =&gt;
  console.log(document.readyState)
);
```

The `readystatechange` event is an alternative mechanics of tracking the document loading state, it appeared long ago. Nowadays, it is rarely used.

Let&#39;s see the full events flow for the completeness.

Here&#39;s a document with `&lt;iframe&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;` and handlers that log events:

```html
&lt;script&gt;
  log(&quot;initial readyState:&quot; + document.readyState);

  document.addEventListener(&quot;readystatechange&quot;, () =&gt;
    log(&quot;readyState:&quot; + document.readyState)
  );
  document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, () =&gt; log(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;));

  window.onload = () =&gt; log(&quot;window onload&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;iframe.html&quot; onload=&quot;log(&#39;iframe onload&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif&quot; id=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  img.onload = () =&gt; log(&quot;img onload&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The working example is [in the sandbox](sandbox:readystate).

The typical output:

1. [1] initial readyState:loading
2. [2] readyState:interactive
3. [2] DOMContentLoaded
4. [3] iframe onload
5. [4] img onload
6. [4] readyState:complete
7. [4] window onload

The numbers in square brackets denote the approximate time of when it happens. Events labeled with the same digit happen approximately at the same time (+- a few ms).

- `document.readyState` becomes `interactive` right before `DOMContentLoaded`. These two things actually mean the same.
- `document.readyState` becomes `complete` when all resources (`iframe` and `img`) are loaded. Here we can see that it happens in about the same time as `img.onload` (`img` is the last resource) and `window.onload`. Switching to `complete` state means the same as `window.onload`. The difference is that `window.onload` always works after all other `load` handlers.

## Summary

Page load events:

- The `DOMContentLoaded` event triggers on `document` when the DOM is ready. We can apply JavaScript to elements at this stage.
  - Script such as `&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;` or `&lt;script src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;` block DOMContentLoaded, the browser waits for them to execute.
  - Images and other resources may also still continue loading.
- The `load` event on `window` triggers when the page and all resources are loaded. We rarely use it, because there&#39;s usually no need to wait for so long.
- The `beforeunload` event on `window` triggers when the user wants to leave the page. If we cancel the event, browser asks whether the user really wants to leave (e.g we have unsaved changes).
- The `unload` event on `window` triggers when the user is finally leaving, in the handler we can only do simple things that do not involve delays or asking a user. Because of that limitation, it&#39;s rarely used. We can send out a network request with `navigator.sendBeacon`.
- `document.readyState` is the current state of the document, changes can be tracked in the `readystatechange` event:
  - `loading` -- the document is loading.
  - `interactive` -- the document is parsed, happens at about the same time as `DOMContentLoaded`, but before it.
  - `complete` -- the document and resources are loaded, happens at about the same time as `window.onload`, but before it.

# Basic operators, maths

We know many operators from school. They are things like addition `+`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`, and so on.

In this chapter, we’ll start with simple operators, then concentrate on JavaScript-specific aspects, not covered by school arithmetic.

## Terms: &quot;unary&quot;, &quot;binary&quot;, &quot;operand&quot;

Before we move on, let&#39;s grasp some common terminology.

- _An operand_ -- is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of `5 * 2` there are two operands: the left operand is `5` and the right operand is `2`. Sometimes, people call these &quot;arguments&quot; instead of &quot;operands&quot;.
- An operator is _unary_ if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation `-` reverses the sign of a number:

  ```js run
  let x = 1;

  *!*
  x = -x;
  */!*
  alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied
  ```

- An operator is _binary_ if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:

  ```js run no-beautify
  let x = 1,
    y = 3;
  alert(y - x); // 2, binary minus subtracts values
  ```

  Formally, in the examples above we have two different operators that share the same symbol: the negation operator, a unary operator that reverses the sign, and the subtraction operator, a binary operator that subtracts one number from another.

## Maths

The following math operations are supported:

- Addition `+`,
- Subtraction `-`,
- Multiplication `*`,
- Division `/`,
- Remainder `%`,
- Exponentiation `**`.

The first four are straightforward, while `%` and `**` need a few words about them.

### Remainder %

The remainder operator `%`, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

The result of `a % b` is the [remainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder) of the integer division of `a` by `b`.

For instance:

```js run
alert(5 % 2); // 1, a remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert(8 % 3); // 2, a remainder of 8 divided by 3
```

### Exponentiation \*\*

The exponentiation operator `a ** b` raises `a` to the power of `b`.

In school maths, we write that as a&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;.

For instance:

```js run
alert(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4
alert(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8
alert(2 ** 4); // 2⁴ = 16
```

Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:

```js run
alert(4 ** (1 / 2)); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
alert(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
```

## String concatenation with binary +

Let&#39;s meet features of JavaScript operators that are beyond school arithmetics.

Usually, the plus operator `+` sums numbers.

But, if the binary `+` is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:

```js
let s = &quot;my&quot; + &quot;string&quot;;
alert(s); // mystring
```

Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.

For example:

```js run
alert(&quot;1&quot; + 2); // &quot;12&quot;
alert(2 + &quot;1&quot;); // &quot;21&quot;
```

See, it doesn&#39;t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.

Here&#39;s a more complex example:

```js run
alert(2 + 2 + &quot;1&quot;); // &quot;41&quot; and not &quot;221&quot;
```

Here, operators work one after another. The first `+` sums two numbers, so it returns `4`, then the next `+` adds the string `1` to it, so it&#39;s like `4 + &#39;1&#39; = &#39;41&#39;`.

```js run
alert(&quot;1&quot; + 2 + 2); // &quot;122&quot; and not &quot;14&quot;
```

Here, the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as strings too. The `2` gets concatenated to `&#39;1&#39;`, so it&#39;s like `&#39;1&#39; + 2 = &quot;12&quot;` and `&quot;12&quot; + 2 = &quot;122&quot;`.

The binary `+` is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

Here&#39;s the demo for subtraction and division:

```js run
alert(6 - &quot;2&quot;); // 4, converts &#39;2&#39; to a number
alert(&quot;6&quot; / &quot;2&quot;); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
```

## Numeric conversion, unary +

The plus `+` exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator `+` applied to a single value, doesn&#39;t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

For example:

```js run
// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert( +x ); // 1

let y = -2;
alert( +y ); // -2

*!*
// Converts non-numbers
alert( +true ); // 1
alert( +&quot;&quot; );   // 0
*/!*
```

It actually does the same thing as `Number(...)`, but is shorter.

The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?

The binary plus would add them as strings:

```js run
let apples = &quot;2&quot;;
let oranges = &quot;3&quot;;

alert(apples + oranges); // &quot;23&quot;, the binary plus concatenates strings
```

If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:

```js run
let apples = &quot;2&quot;;
let oranges = &quot;3&quot;;

*!*
// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5
*/!*

// the longer variant
// alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5
```

From a mathematician&#39;s standpoint, the abundance of pluses may seem strange. But from a programmer&#39;s standpoint, there&#39;s nothing special: unary pluses are applied first, they convert strings to numbers, and then the binary plus sums them up.

Why are unary pluses applied to values before the binary ones? As we&#39;re going to see, that&#39;s because of their _higher precedence_.

## Operator precedence

If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their _precedence_, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.

From school, we all know that the multiplication in the expression `1 + 2 * 2` should be calculated before the addition. That&#39;s exactly the precedence thing. The multiplication is said to have _a higher precedence_ than the addition.

Parentheses override any precedence, so if we&#39;re not satisfied with the default order, we can use them to change it. For example, write `(1 + 2) * 2`.

There are many operators in JavaScript. Every operator has a corresponding precedence number. The one with the larger number executes first. If the precedence is the same, the execution order is from left to right.

Here&#39;s an extract from the [precedence table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) (you don&#39;t need to remember this, but note that unary operators are higher than corresponding binary ones):

| Precedence | Name           | Sign |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---- |
| ...        | ...            | ...  |
| 17         | unary plus     | `+`  |
| 17         | unary negation | `-`  |
| 16         | exponentiation | `**` |
| 15         | multiplication | `*`  |
| 15         | division       | `/`  |
| 13         | addition       | `+`  |
| 13         | subtraction    | `-`  |
| ...        | ...            | ...  |
| 3          | assignment     | `=`  |
| ...        | ...            | ...  |

As we can see, the &quot;unary plus&quot; has a priority of `17` which is higher than the `13` of &quot;addition&quot; (binary plus). That&#39;s why, in the expression `&quot;+apples + +oranges&quot;`, unary pluses work before the addition.

## Assignment

Let&#39;s note that an assignment `=` is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low priority of `3`.

That&#39;s why, when we assign a variable, like `x = 2 * 2 + 1`, the calculations are done first and then the `=` is evaluated, storing the result in `x`.

```js
let x = 2 * 2 + 1;

alert(x); // 5
```

### Assignment = returns a value

The fact of `=` being an operator, not a &quot;magical&quot; language construct has an interesting implication.

All operators in JavaScript return a value. That&#39;s obvious for `+` and `-`, but also true for `=`.

The call `x = value` writes the `value` into `x` _and then returns it_.

Here&#39;s a demo that uses an assignment as part of a more complex expression:

```js run
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

*!*
let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);
*/!*

alert( a ); // 3
alert( c ); // 0
```

In the example above, the result of expression `(a = b + 1)` is the value which was assigned to `a` (that is `3`). It is then used for further evaluations.

Funny code, isn&#39;t it? We should understand how it works, because sometimes we see it in JavaScript libraries.

Although, please don&#39;t write the code like that. Such tricks definitely don&#39;t make code clearer or readable.

### Chaining assignments

Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:

```js run
let a, b, c;

*!*
a = b = c = 2 + 2;
*/!*

alert( a ); // 4
alert( b ); // 4
alert( c ); // 4
```

Chained assignments evaluate from right to left. First, the rightmost expression `2 + 2` is evaluated and then assigned to the variables on the left: `c`, `b` and `a`. At the end, all the variables share a single value.

Once again, for the purposes of readability it&#39;s better to split such code into few lines:

```js
c = 2 + 2;
b = c;
a = c;
```

That&#39;s easier to read, especially when eye-scanning the code fast.

## Modify-in-place

We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.

For example:

```js
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;
```

This notation can be shortened using the operators `+=` and `*=`:

```js run
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

alert(n); // 14
```

Short &quot;modify-and-assign&quot; operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: `/=`, `-=`, etc.

Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations:

```js run
let n = 2;

n *= 3 + 5;

alert(n); // 16  (right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8)
```

## Increment/decrement

&lt;!-- Can&#39;t use -- in title, because the built-in parser turns it into a &#39;long dash&#39; – --&gt;

Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.

So, there are special operators for it:

- **Increment** `++` increases a variable by 1:

  ```js run no-beautify
  let counter = 2;
  counter++; // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
  alert(counter); // 3
  ```

- **Decrement** `--` decreases a variable by 1:

  ```js run no-beautify
  let counter = 2;
  counter--; // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
  alert(counter); // 1
  ```

```warn
Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like `5++` will give an error.
```

The operators `++` and `--` can be placed either before or after a variable.

- When the operator goes after the variable, it is in &quot;postfix form&quot;: `counter++`.
- The &quot;prefix form&quot; is when the operator goes before the variable: `++counter`.

Both of these statements do the same thing: increase `counter` by `1`.

Is there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of `++/--`.

Let&#39;s clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).

To see the difference, here&#39;s an example:

```js run
let counter = 1;
let a = ++counter; // (*)

alert(a); // *!*2*/!*
```

In the line `(*)`, the _prefix_ form `++counter` increments `counter` and returns the new value, `2`. So, the `alert` shows `2`.

Now, let&#39;s use the postfix form:

```js run
let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++

alert(a); // *!*1*/!*
```

In the line `(*)`, the _postfix_ form `counter++` also increments `counter` but returns the _old_ value (prior to increment). So, the `alert` shows `1`.

To summarize:

- If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in which form to use:

  ```js run
  let counter = 0;
  counter++;
  ++counter;
  alert(counter); // 2, the lines above did the same
  ```

- If we&#39;d like to increase a value _and_ immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form:

  ```js run
  let counter = 0;
  alert(++counter); // 1
  ```

- If we&#39;d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:

  ```js run
  let counter = 0;
  alert(counter++); // 0
  ```

````smart header=&quot;Increment/decrement among other operators&quot;
The operators `++/--` can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations.

For instance:

```js run
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4
```

Compare with:

```js run
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2, because counter++ returns the &quot;old&quot; value
```

Though technically okay, such notation usually makes code less readable. One line does multiple things -- not good.

While reading code, a fast &quot;vertical&quot; eye-scan can easily miss something like `counter++` and it won&#39;t be obvious that the variable increased.

We advise a style of &quot;one line -- one action&quot;:

```js run
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter );
counter++;
```
````

## Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.

The list of operators:

- AND ( `&amp;` )
- OR ( `|` )
- XOR ( `^` )
- NOT ( `~` )
- LEFT SHIFT ( `&lt;&lt;` )
- RIGHT SHIFT ( `&gt;&gt;` )
- ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `&gt;&gt;&gt;` )

These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. We won&#39;t need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful. You can read the [Bitwise Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Bitwise) chapter on MDN when a need arises.

## Comma

The comma operator `,` is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it&#39;s used to write shorter code, so we need to know it in order to understand what&#39;s going on.

The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma `,`. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.

For example:

```js run
*!*
let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
*/!*

alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
```

Here, the first expression `1 + 2` is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, `3 + 4` is evaluated and returned as the result.

```smart header=&quot;Comma has a very low precedence&quot;
Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than `=`, so parentheses are important in the example above.

Without them: `a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4` evaluates `+` first, summing the numbers into `a = 3, 7`, then the assignment operator `=` assigns `a = 3`, and the rest is ignored. It&#39;s like `(a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4`.
```

Why do we need an operator that throws away everything except the last expression?

Sometimes, people use it in more complex constructs to put several actions in one line.

For example:

```js
// three operations in one line
for (*!*a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b*/!*; a &lt; 10; a++) {
 ...
}
```

Such tricks are used in many JavaScript frameworks. That&#39;s why we&#39;re mentioning them. But usually they don&#39;t improve code readability so we should think well before using them.

# Scripts: async, defer

In modern websites, scripts are often &quot;heavier&quot; than HTML: their download size is larger, and processing time is also longer.

When the browser loads HTML and comes across a `&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;` tag, it can&#39;t continue building the DOM. It must execute the script right now. The same happens for external scripts `&lt;script src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`: the browser must wait for the script to download, execute the downloaded script, and only then can it process the rest of the page.

That leads to two important issues:

1. Scripts can&#39;t see DOM elements below them, so they can&#39;t add handlers etc.
2. If there&#39;s a bulky script at the top of the page, it &quot;blocks the page&quot;. Users can&#39;t see the page content till it downloads and runs:

```html run height=100
&lt;p&gt;...content before script...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- This isn&#39;t visible until the script loads --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...content after script...&lt;/p&gt;
```

There are some workarounds to that. For instance, we can put a script at the bottom of the page. Then it can see elements above it, and it doesn&#39;t block the page content from showing:

```html
&lt;body&gt;
  ...all content is above the script...

  &lt;script src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

But this solution is far from perfect. For example, the browser notices the script (and can start downloading it) only after it downloaded the full HTML document. For long HTML documents, that may be a noticeable delay.

Such things are invisible for people using very fast connections, but many people in the world still have slow internet speeds and use a far-from-perfect mobile internet connection.

Luckily, there are two `&lt;script&gt;` attributes that solve the problem for us: `defer` and `async`.

## defer

The `defer` attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads &quot;in the background&quot;, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.

Here&#39;s the same example as above, but with `defer`:

```html run height=100
&lt;p&gt;...content before script...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script
  defer
  src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1&quot;
&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- visible immediately --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...content after script...&lt;/p&gt;
```

In other words:

- Scripts with `defer` never block the page.
- Scripts with `defer` always execute when the DOM is ready (but before `DOMContentLoaded` event).

The following example demonstrates the second part:

```html run height=100
&lt;p&gt;...content before scripts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, () =&gt;
    alert(&quot;DOM ready after defer!&quot;)
  );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script
  defer
  src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1&quot;
&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...content after scripts...&lt;/p&gt;
```

1. The page content shows up immediately.
2. `DOMContentLoaded` event handler waits for the deferred script. It only triggers when the script is downloaded and executed.

**Deferred scripts keep their relative order, just like regular scripts.**

Let&#39;s say, we have two deferred scripts: the `long.js` and then `small.js`:

```html
&lt;script
  defer
  src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js&quot;
&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script
  defer
  src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js&quot;
&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Browsers scan the page for scripts and download them in parallel, to improve performance. So in the example above both scripts download in parallel. The `small.js` probably finishes first.

...But the `defer` attribute, besides telling the browser &quot;not to block&quot;, ensures that the relative order is kept. So even though `small.js` loads first, it still waits and runs after `long.js` executes.

That may be important for cases when we need to load a JavaScript library and then a script that depends on it.

```smart header=&quot;The `defer`attribute is only for external scripts&quot; The`defer`attribute is ignored if the`&lt;script&gt;`tag has no`src`.

````

## async

The `async` attribute is somewhat like `defer`. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.

The `async` attribute means that a script is completely independent:

- The browser doesn&#39;t block on `async` scripts (like `defer`).
- Other scripts don&#39;t wait for `async` scripts, and `async` scripts don&#39;t wait for them.
- `DOMContentLoaded` and async scripts don&#39;t wait for each other:
    - `DOMContentLoaded` may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)
    - ...or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)

In other words, `async` scripts load in the background and run when ready. The DOM and other scripts don&#39;t wait for them, and they don&#39;t wait for anything. A fully independent script that runs when loaded. As simple, as it can get, right?

Here&#39;s an example similar to what we&#39;ve seen with `defer`: two scripts `long.js` and `small.js`, but now with `async` instead of `defer`.

They don&#39;t wait for each other. Whatever loads first (probably `small.js`) -- runs first:

```html run height=100
&lt;p&gt;...content before scripts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, () =&gt; alert(&quot;DOM ready!&quot;));
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...content after scripts...&lt;/p&gt;
````

- The page content shows up immediately: `async` doesn&#39;t block it.
- `DOMContentLoaded` may happen both before and after `async`, no guarantees here.
- A smaller script `small.js` goes second, but probably loads before `long.js`, so `small.js` runs first. Although, it might be that `long.js` loads first, if cached, then it runs first. In other words, async scripts run in the &quot;load-first&quot; order.

Async scripts are great when we integrate an independent third-party script into the page: counters, ads and so on, as they don&#39;t depend on our scripts, and our scripts shouldn&#39;t wait for them:

```html
&lt;!-- Google Analytics is usually added like this --&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;https://google-analytics.com/analytics.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Dynamic scripts

There&#39;s one more important way of adding a script to the page.

We can create a script and append it to the document dynamically using JavaScript:

```js run
let script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
script.src = &quot;/article/script-async-defer/long.js&quot;;
document.body.append(script); // (*)
```

The script starts loading as soon as it&#39;s appended to the document `(*)`.

**Dynamic scripts behave as &quot;async&quot; by default.**

That is:

- They don&#39;t wait for anything, nothing waits for them.
- The script that loads first -- runs first (&quot;load-first&quot; order).

This can be changed if we explicitly set `script.async=false`. Then scripts will be executed in the document order, just like `defer`.

In this example, `loadScript(src)` function adds a script and also sets `async` to `false`.

So `long.js` always runs first (as it&#39;s added first):

```js run
function loadScript(src) {
  let script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
  script.src = src;
  script.async = false;
  document.body.append(script);
}

// long.js runs first because of async=false
loadScript(&quot;/article/script-async-defer/long.js&quot;);
loadScript(&quot;/article/script-async-defer/small.js&quot;);
```

Without `script.async=false`, scripts would execute in default, load-first order (the `small.js` probably first).

Again, as with the `defer`, the order matters if we&#39;d like to load a library and then another script that depends on it.

## Summary

Both `async` and `defer` have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesn&#39;t block page rendering. So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.

But there are also essential differences between them:

|         | Order                                                                                   | `DOMContentLoaded`                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `async` | _Load-first order_. Their document order doesn&#39;t matter -- which loads first runs first | Irrelevant. May load and execute while the document has not yet been fully downloaded. That happens if scripts are small or cached, and the document is long enough. |
| `defer` | _Document order_ (as they go in the document).                                          | Execute after the document is loaded and parsed (they wait if needed), right before `DOMContentLoaded`.                                                              |

In practice, `defer` is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important.

And `async` is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their relative execution order does not matter.

```warn header=&quot;Page without scripts should be usable&quot;
Please note: if you&#39;re using `defer` or `async`, then user will see the the page *before* the script loads.

In such case, some graphical components are probably not initialized yet.

Don&#39;t forget to put &quot;loading&quot; indication and disable buttons that aren&#39;t functional yet. Let the user clearly see what he can do on the page, and what&#39;s still getting ready.
```

# Resource loading: onload and onerror

The browser allows us to track the loading of external resources -- scripts, iframes, pictures and so on.

There are two events for it:

- `onload` -- successful load,
- `onerror` -- an error occurred.

## Loading a script

Let&#39;s say we need to load a third-party script and call a function that resides there.

We can load it dynamically, like this:

```js
let script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
script.src = &quot;my.js&quot;;

document.head.append(script);
```

...But how to run the function that is declared inside that script? We need to wait until the script loads, and only then we can call it.

```smart
For our own scripts we could use [JavaScript modules](info:modules) here, but they are not widely adopted by third-party libraries.
```

### script.onload

The main helper is the `load` event. It triggers after the script was loaded and executed.

For instance:

```js run untrusted
let script = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);

// can load any script, from any domain
script.src = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js&quot;
document.head.append(script);

*!*
script.onload = function() {
  // the script creates a variable &quot;_&quot;
  alert( _.VERSION ); // shows library version
};
*/!*
```

So in `onload` we can use script variables, run functions etc.

...And what if the loading failed? For instance, there&#39;s no such script (error 404) or the server is down (unavailable).

### script.onerror

Errors that occur during the loading of the script can be tracked in an `error` event.

For instance, let&#39;s request a script that doesn&#39;t exist:

```js run
let script = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
script.src = &quot;https://example.com/404.js&quot;; // no such script
document.head.append(script);

*!*
script.onerror = function() {
  alert(&quot;Error loading &quot; + this.src); // Error loading https://example.com/404.js
};
*/!*
```

Please note that we can&#39;t get HTTP error details here. We don&#39;t know if it was an error 404 or 500 or something else. Just that the loading failed.

```warn
Events `onload`/`onerror` track only the loading itself.

Errors that may occur during script processing and execution are out of scope for these events. That is: if a script loaded successfully, then `onload` triggers, even if it has programming errors in it. To track script errors, one can use `window.onerror` global handler.
```

## Other resources

The `load` and `error` events also work for other resources, basically for any resource that has an external `src`.

For example:

```js run
let img = document.createElement(&quot;img&quot;);
img.src = &quot;https://js.cx/clipart/train.gif&quot;; // (*)

img.onload = function () {
  alert(`Image loaded, size ${img.width}x${img.height}`);
};

img.onerror = function () {
  alert(&quot;Error occurred while loading image&quot;);
};
```

There are some notes though:

- Most resources start loading when they are added to the document. But `&lt;img&gt;` is an exception. It starts loading when it gets a src `(*)`.
- For `&lt;iframe&gt;`, the `iframe.onload` event triggers when the iframe loading finished, both for successful load and in case of an error.

That&#39;s for historical reasons.

## Crossorigin policy

There&#39;s a rule: scripts from one site can&#39;t access contents of the other site. So, e.g. a script at `https://facebook.com` can&#39;t read the user&#39;s mailbox at `https://gmail.com`.

Or, to be more precise, one origin (domain/port/protocol triplet) can&#39;t access the content from another one. So even if we have a subdomain, or just another port, these are different origins with no access to each other.

This rule also affects resources from other domains.

If we&#39;re using a script from another domain, and there&#39;s an error in it, we can&#39;t get error details.

For example, let&#39;s take a script `error.js` that consists of a single (bad) function call:

```js
// 📁 error.js
noSuchFunction();
```

Now load it from the same site where it&#39;s located:

```html run height=0
&lt;script&gt;
  window.onerror = function (message, url, line, col, errorObj) {
    alert(`${message}\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

We can see a good error report, like this:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: noSuchFunction is not defined
https://javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js, 1:1
```

Now let&#39;s load the same script from another domain:

```html run height=0
&lt;script&gt;
  window.onerror = function (message, url, line, col, errorObj) {
    alert(`${message}\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

The report is different, like this:

```
Script error.
, 0:0
```

Details may vary depending on the browser, but the idea is the same: any information about the internals of a script, including error stack traces, is hidden. Exactly because it&#39;s from another domain.

Why do we need error details?

There are many services (and we can build our own) that listen for global errors using `window.onerror`, save errors and provide an interface to access and analyze them. That&#39;s great, as we can see real errors, triggered by our users. But if a script comes from another origin, then there&#39;s not much information about errors in it, as we&#39;ve just seen.

Similar cross-origin policy (CORS) is enforced for other types of resources as well.

**To allow cross-origin access, the `&lt;script&gt;` tag needs to have the `crossorigin` attribute, plus the remote server must provide special headers.**

There are three levels of cross-origin access:

1. **No `crossorigin` attribute** -- access prohibited.
2. **`crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;`** -- access allowed if the server responds with the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with `*` or our origin. Browser does not send authorization information and cookies to remote server.
3. **`crossorigin=&quot;use-credentials&quot;`** -- access allowed if the server sends back the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with our origin and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. Browser sends authorization information and cookies to remote server.

```smart
You can read more about cross-origin access in the chapter &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt;. It describes the `fetch` method for network requests, but the policy is exactly the same.

Such thing as &quot;cookies&quot; is out of our current scope, but you can read about them in the chapter &lt;info:cookie&gt;.
```

In our case, we didn&#39;t have any crossorigin attribute. So the cross-origin access was prohibited. Let&#39;s add it.

We can choose between `&quot;anonymous&quot;` (no cookies sent, one server-side header needed) and `&quot;use-credentials&quot;` (sends cookies too, two server-side headers needed).

If we don&#39;t care about cookies, then `&quot;anonymous&quot;` is the way to go:

```html run height=0
&lt;script&gt;
window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {
  alert(`${message}\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);
};
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script *!*crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;*/!* src=&quot;https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

Now, assuming that the server provides an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, everything&#39;s fine. We have the full error report.

## Summary

Images `&lt;img&gt;`, external styles, scripts and other resources provide `load` and `error` events to track their loading:

- `load` triggers on a successful load,
- `error` triggers on a failed load.

The only exception is `&lt;iframe&gt;`: for historical reasons it always triggers `load`, for any load completion, even if the page is not found.

The `readystatechange` event also works for resources, but is rarely used, because `load/error` events are simpler.

# Mutation observer

`MutationObserver` is a built-in object that observes a DOM element and fires a callback when it detects a change.

We&#39;ll first take a look at the syntax, and then explore a real-world use case, to see where such thing may be useful.

## Syntax

`MutationObserver` is easy to use.

First, we create an observer with a callback-function:

```js
let observer = new MutationObserver(callback);
```

And then attach it to a DOM node:

```js
observer.observe(node, config);
```

`config` is an object with boolean options &quot;what kind of changes to react on&quot;:

- `childList` -- changes in the direct children of `node`,
- `subtree` -- in all descendants of `node`,
- `attributes` -- attributes of `node`,
- `attributeFilter` -- an array of attribute names, to observe only selected ones.
- `characterData` -- whether to observe `node.data` (text content),

Few other options:

- `attributeOldValue` -- if `true`, pass both the old and the new value of attribute to callback (see below), otherwise only the new one (needs `attributes` option),
- `characterDataOldValue` -- if `true`, pass both the old and the new value of `node.data` to callback (see below), otherwise only the new one (needs `characterData` option).

Then after any changes, the `callback` is executed: changes are passed in the first argument as a list of [MutationRecord](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#mutationrecord) objects, and the observer itself as the second argument.

[MutationRecord](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#mutationrecord) objects have properties:

- `type` -- mutation type, one of
  - `&quot;attributes&quot;`: attribute modified
  - `&quot;characterData&quot;`: data modified, used for text nodes,
  - `&quot;childList&quot;`: child elements added/removed,
- `target` -- where the change occurred: an element for `&quot;attributes&quot;`, or text node for `&quot;characterData&quot;`, or an element for a `&quot;childList&quot;` mutation,
- `addedNodes/removedNodes` -- nodes that were added/removed,
- `previousSibling/nextSibling` -- the previous and next sibling to added/removed nodes,
- `attributeName/attributeNamespace` -- the name/namespace (for XML) of the changed attribute,
- `oldValue` -- the previous value, only for attribute or text changes, if the corresponding option is set `attributeOldValue`/`characterDataOldValue`.

For example, here&#39;s a `&lt;div&gt;` with a `contentEditable` attribute. That attribute allows us to focus on it and edit.

```html run
&lt;div contenteditable id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Click and &lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt;, please&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let observer = new MutationObserver((mutationRecords) =&gt; {
    console.log(mutationRecords); // console.log(the changes)
  });

  // observe everything except attributes
  observer.observe(elem, {
    childList: true, // observe direct children
    subtree: true, // and lower descendants too
    characterDataOldValue: true, // pass old data to callback
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
```

If we run this code in the browser, then focus on the given `&lt;div&gt;` and change the text inside `&lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt;`, `console.log` will show one mutation:

```js
mutationRecords = [{
  type: &quot;characterData&quot;,
  oldValue: &quot;edit&quot;,
  target: &lt;text node&gt;,
  // other properties empty
}];
```

If we make more complex editing operations, e.g. remove the `&lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt;`, the mutation event may contain multiple mutation records:

```js
mutationRecords = [{
  type: &quot;childList&quot;,
  target: &lt;div#elem&gt;,
  removedNodes: [&lt;b&gt;],
  nextSibling: &lt;text node&gt;,
  previousSibling: &lt;text node&gt;
  // other properties empty
}, {
  type: &quot;characterData&quot;
  target: &lt;text node&gt;
  // ...mutation details depend on how the browser handles such removal
  // it may coalesce two adjacent text nodes &quot;edit &quot; and &quot;, please&quot; into one node
  // or it may leave them separate text nodes
}];
```

So, `MutationObserver` allows to react on any changes within DOM subtree.

## Usage for integration

When such thing may be useful?

Imagine the situation when you need to add a third-party script that contains useful functionality, but also does something unwanted, e.g. shows ads `&lt;div class=&quot;ads&quot;&gt;Unwanted ads&lt;/div&gt;`.

Naturally, the third-party script provides no mechanisms to remove it.

Using `MutationObserver`, we can detect when the unwanted element appears in our DOM and remove it.

There are other situations when a third-party script adds something into our document, and we&#39;d like to detect, when it happens, to adapt our page, dynamically resize something etc.

`MutationObserver` allows to implement this.

## Usage for architecture

There are also situations when `MutationObserver` is good from architectural standpoint.

Let&#39;s say we&#39;re making a website about programming. Naturally, articles and other materials may contain source code snippets.

Such snippet in an HTML markup looks like this:

```html
...
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  // here&#39;s the code
  let hello = &quot;world&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
...
```

For better readability and at the same time, to beautify it, we&#39;ll be using a JavaScript syntax highlighting library on our site, like [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/). To get syntax highlighting for above snippet in Prism, `Prism.highlightElem(pre)` is called, which examines the contents of such `pre` elements and adds special tags and styles for colored syntax highlighting into those elements, similar to what you see in examples here, on this page.

When exactly should we run that highlighting method? Well, we can do it on `DOMContentLoaded` event, or put the script at the bottom of the page. The moment our DOM is ready, we can search for elements `pre[class*=&quot;language&quot;]` and call `Prism.highlightElem` on them:

```js
// highlight all code snippets on the page
document
  .querySelectorAll(&#39;pre[class*=&quot;language&quot;]&#39;)
  .forEach(Prism.highlightElem);
```

Everything&#39;s simple so far, right? We find code snippets in HTML and highlight them.

Now let&#39;s go on. Let&#39;s say we&#39;re going to dynamically fetch materials from a server. We&#39;ll study methods for that [later in the tutorial](info:fetch). For now it only matters that we fetch an HTML article from a webserver and display it on demand:

```js
let article =
  /* fetch new content from server */
  (articleElem.innerHTML = article);
```

The new `article` HTML may contain code snippets. We need to call `Prism.highlightElem` on them, otherwise they won&#39;t get highlighted.

**Where and when to call `Prism.highlightElem` for a dynamically loaded article?**

We could append that call to the code that loads an article, like this:

```js
let article = /* fetch new content from server */
articleElem.innerHTML = article;

*!*
let snippets = articleElem.querySelectorAll(&#39;pre[class*=&quot;language-&quot;]&#39;);
snippets.forEach(Prism.highlightElem);
*/!*
```

...But, imagine if we have many places in the code where we load our content - articles, quizzes, forum posts, etc. Do we need to put the highlighting call everywhere, to highlight the code in content after loading? That&#39;s not very convenient.

And what if the content is loaded by a third-party module? For example, we have a forum written by someone else, that loads content dynamically, and we&#39;d like to add syntax highlighting to it. No one likes patching third-party scripts.

Luckily, there&#39;s another option.

We can use `MutationObserver` to automatically detect when code snippets are inserted into the page and highlight them.

So we&#39;ll handle the highlighting functionality in one place, relieving us from the need to integrate it.

### Dynamic highlight demo

Here&#39;s the working example.

If you run this code, it starts observing the element below and highlighting any code snippets that appear there:

```js run
let observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) =&gt; {
  for (let mutation of mutations) {
    // examine new nodes, is there anything to highlight?

    for (let node of mutation.addedNodes) {
      // we track only elements, skip other nodes (e.g. text nodes)
      if (!(node instanceof HTMLElement)) continue;

      // check the inserted element for being a code snippet
      if (node.matches(&#39;pre[class*=&quot;language-&quot;]&#39;)) {
        Prism.highlightElement(node);
      }

      // or maybe there&#39;s a code snippet somewhere in its subtree?
      for (let elem of node.querySelectorAll(&#39;pre[class*=&quot;language-&quot;]&#39;)) {
        Prism.highlightElement(elem);
      }
    }
  }
});

let demoElem = document.getElementById(&quot;highlight-demo&quot;);

observer.observe(demoElem, { childList: true, subtree: true });
```

Here, below, there&#39;s an HTML-element and JavaScript that dynamically fills it using `innerHTML`.

Please run the previous code (above, observes that element), and then the code below. You&#39;ll see how `MutationObserver` detects and highlights the snippet.

&lt;p id=&quot;highlight-demo&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ddd&quot;&gt;A demo-element with &lt;code&gt;id=&quot;highlight-demo&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, run the code above to observe it.&lt;/p&gt;

The following code populates its `innerHTML`, that causes the `MutationObserver` to react and highlight its contents:

```js run
let demoElem = document.getElementById(&quot;highlight-demo&quot;);

// dynamically insert content with code snippets
demoElem.innerHTML = `A code snippet is below:
  &lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; let hello = &quot;world!&quot;; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Another one:&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.class { margin: 5px; } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
`;
```

Now we have `MutationObserver` that can track all highlighting in observed elements or the whole `document`. We can add/remove code snippets in HTML without thinking about it.

## Additional methods

There&#39;s a method to stop observing the node:

- `observer.disconnect()` -- stops the observation.

When we stop the observing, it might be possible that some changes were not yet processed by the observer. In such cases, we use

- `observer.takeRecords()` -- gets a list of unprocessed mutation records - those that happened, but the callback has not handled them.

These methods can be used together, like this:

```js
// get a list of unprocessed mutations
// should be called before disconnecting,
// if you care about possibly unhandled recent mutations
let mutationRecords = observer.takeRecords();

// stop tracking changes
observer.disconnect();
...
```

```smart header=&quot;Records returned by `observer.takeRecords()`are removed from the processing queue&quot; The callback won&#39;t be called for records, returned by`observer.takeRecords()`.

````

```smart header=&quot;Garbage collection interaction&quot;
Observers use weak references to nodes internally. That is, if a node is removed from the DOM, and becomes unreachable, then it can be garbage collected.

The mere fact that a DOM node is observed doesn&#39;t prevent the garbage collection.
````

## Summary

`MutationObserver` can react to changes in DOM - attributes, text content and adding/removing elements.

We can use it to track changes introduced by other parts of our code, as well as to integrate with third-party scripts.

`MutationObserver` can track any changes. The config &quot;what to observe&quot; options are used for optimizations, not to spend resources on unneeded callback invocations.

# Selection and Range

In this chapter we&#39;ll cover selection in the document, as well as selection in form fields, such as `&lt;input&gt;`.

JavaScript can access an existing selection, select/deselect DOM nodes as a whole or partially, remove the selected content from the document, wrap it into a tag, and so on.

You can find some recipes for common tasks at the end of the chapter, in &quot;Summary&quot; section. Maybe that covers your current needs, but you&#39;ll get much more if you read the whole text.

The underlying `Range` and `Selection` objects are easy to grasp, and then you&#39;ll need no recipes to make them do what you want.

## Range

The basic concept of selection is [Range](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ranges), that is essentially a pair of &quot;boundary points&quot;: range start and range end.

A `Range` object is created without parameters:

```js
let range = new Range();
```

Then we can set the selection boundaries using `range.setStart(node, offset)` and `range.setEnd(node, offset)`.

As you might guess, further we&#39;ll use the `Range` objects for selection, but first let&#39;s create few such objects.

### Selecting the text partially

The interesting thing is that the first argument `node` in both methods can be either a text node or an element node, and the meaning of the second argument depends on that.

**If `node` is a text node, then `offset` must be the position in its text.**

For example, given the element `&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;`, we can create the range containing the letters &quot;ll&quot; as follows:

```html run
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  let range = new Range();
  range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);
  range.setEnd(p.firstChild, 4);

  // toString of a range returns its content as text
  console.log(range); // ll
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Here we take the first child of `&lt;p&gt;` (that&#39;s the text node) and specify the text positions inside it:

![](range-hello-1.svg)

### Selecting element nodes

**Alternatively, if `node` is an element node, then `offset` must be the child number.**

That&#39;s handy for making ranges that contain nodes as a whole, not stop somewhere inside their text.

For example, we have a more complex document fragment:

```html autorun
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
```

Here&#39;s its DOM structure with both element and text nodes:

&lt;div class=&quot;select-p-domtree&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
let selectPDomtree = {
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;P&quot;,
  &quot;nodeType&quot;: 1,
  &quot;children&quot;: [{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;#text&quot;,
    &quot;nodeType&quot;: 3,
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Example: &quot;
  }, {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;I&quot;,
    &quot;nodeType&quot;: 1,
    &quot;children&quot;: [{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;#text&quot;,
      &quot;nodeType&quot;: 3,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;italic&quot;
    }]
  }, {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;#text&quot;,
    &quot;nodeType&quot;: 3,
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot; and &quot;
  }, {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;B&quot;,
    &quot;nodeType&quot;: 1,
    &quot;children&quot;: [{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;#text&quot;,
      &quot;nodeType&quot;: 3,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;bold&quot;
    }]
  }]
}

drawHtmlTree(selectPDomtree, &#39;div.select-p-domtree&#39;, 690, 320);
&lt;/script&gt;

Let&#39;s make a range for `&quot;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;&quot;`.

As we can see, this phrase consists of exactly two children of `&lt;p&gt;`, with indexes `0` and `1`:

![](range-example-p-0-1.svg)

- The starting point has `&lt;p&gt;` as the parent `node`, and `0` as the offset.

  So we can set it as `range.setStart(p, 0)`.

- The ending point also has `&lt;p&gt;` as the parent `node`, but `2` as the offset (it specifies the range up to, but not including `offset`).

  So we can set it as `range.setEnd(p, 2)`.

Here&#39;s the demo. If you run it, you can see that the text gets selected:

```html run
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  *!*
    let range = new Range();

    range.setStart(p, 0);
    range.setEnd(p, 2);
  */!*

    // toString of a range returns its content as text, without tags
    console.log(range); // Example: italic

    // apply this range for document selection (explained later below)
    document.getSelection().addRange(range);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Here&#39;s a more flexible test stand where you can set range start/end numbers and explore other variants:

```html run autorun
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;input id=&quot;start&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; – To
&lt;input id=&quot;end&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; value=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Click to select&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  button.onclick = () =&gt; {
  *!*
    let range = new Range();

    range.setStart(p, start.value);
    range.setEnd(p, end.value);
  */!*

    // apply the selection, explained later below
    document.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    document.getSelection().addRange(range);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

E.g. selecting in the same `&lt;p&gt;` from offset `1` to `4` gives us the range `&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;`:

![](range-example-p-1-3.svg)

```smart header=&quot;Starting and ending nodes can be different&quot;
We don&#39;t have to use the same node in `setStart` and `setEnd`. A range may span across many unrelated nodes. It&#39;s only important that the end is after the start in the document.
```

### Selecting a bigger fragment

Let&#39;s make a bigger selection in our example, like this:

![](range-example-p-2-b-3.svg)

We already know how to do that. We just need to set the start and the end as a relative offset in text nodes.

We need to create a range, that:

- starts from position 2 in `&lt;p&gt;` first child (taking all but two first letters of &quot;Ex&lt;b&gt;ample:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;)
- ends at the position 3 in `&lt;b&gt;` first child (taking first three letters of &quot;&lt;b&gt;bol&lt;/b&gt;d&quot;, but no more):

```html run
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let range = new Range();

  range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);
  range.setEnd(p.querySelector(&quot;b&quot;).firstChild, 3);

  console.log(range); // ample: italic and bol

  // use this range for selection (explained later)
  window.getSelection().addRange(range);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

As you can see, it&#39;s fairly easy to make a range of whatever we want.

If we&#39;d like to take nodes as a whole, we can pass elements in `setStart/setEnd`. Otherwise, we can work on the text level.

## Range properties

The range object that we created in the example above has following properties:

![](range-example-p-2-b-3-range.svg)

- `startContainer`, `startOffset` -- node and offset of the start,
  - in the example above: first text node inside `&lt;p&gt;` and `2`.
- `endContainer`, `endOffset` -- node and offset of the end,
  - in the example above: first text node inside `&lt;b&gt;` and `3`.
- `collapsed` -- boolean, `true` if the range starts and ends on the same point (so there&#39;s no content inside the range),
  - in the example above: `false`
- `commonAncestorContainer` -- the nearest common ancestor of all nodes within the range,
  - in the example above: `&lt;p&gt;`

## Range selection methods

There are many convenience methods to manipulate ranges.

We&#39;ve already seen `setStart` and `setEnd`, here are other similar methods.

Set range start:

- `setStart(node, offset)` set start at: position `offset` in `node`
- `setStartBefore(node)` set start at: right before `node`
- `setStartAfter(node)` set start at: right after `node`

Set range end (similar methods):

- `setEnd(node, offset)` set end at: position `offset` in `node`
- `setEndBefore(node)` set end at: right before `node`
- `setEndAfter(node)` set end at: right after `node`

Technically, `setStart/setEnd` can do anything, but more methods provide more convenience.

In all these methods, `node` can be both a text or element node: for text nodes `offset` skips that many of characters, while for element nodes that many child nodes.

Even more methods to create ranges:

- `selectNode(node)` set range to select the whole `node`
- `selectNodeContents(node)` set range to select the whole `node` contents
- `collapse(toStart)` if `toStart=true` set end=start, otherwise set start=end, thus collapsing the range
- `cloneRange()` creates a new range with the same start/end

## Range editing methods

Once the range is created, we can manipulate its content using these methods:

- `deleteContents()` -- remove range content from the document
- `extractContents()` -- remove range content from the document and return as [DocumentFragment](info:modifying-document#document-fragment)
- `cloneContents()` -- clone range content and return as [DocumentFragment](info:modifying-document#document-fragment)
- `insertNode(node)` -- insert `node` into the document at the beginning of the range
- `surroundContents(node)` -- wrap `node` around range content. For this to work, the range must contain both opening and closing tags for all elements inside it: no partial ranges like `&lt;i&gt;abc`.

With these methods we can do basically anything with selected nodes.

Here&#39;s the test stand to see them in action:

```html run refresh autorun height=260
Click buttons to run methods on the selection, &quot;resetExample&quot; to reset it.

&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  let range = new Range();

  // Each demonstrated method is represented here:
  let methods = {
    deleteContents() {
      range.deleteContents();
    },
    extractContents() {
      let content = range.extractContents();
      result.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;;
      result.append(&quot;extracted: &quot;, content);
    },
    cloneContents() {
      let content = range.cloneContents();
      result.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;;
      result.append(&quot;cloned: &quot;, content);
    },
    insertNode() {
      let newNode = document.createElement(&quot;u&quot;);
      newNode.innerHTML = &quot;NEW NODE&quot;;
      range.insertNode(newNode);
    },
    surroundContents() {
      let newNode = document.createElement(&quot;u&quot;);
      try {
        range.surroundContents(newNode);
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
      }
    },
    resetExample() {
      p.innerHTML = `Example: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;`;
      result.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;;

      range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);
      range.setEnd(p.querySelector(&quot;b&quot;).firstChild, 3);

      window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
      window.getSelection().addRange(range);
    },
  };

  for (let method in methods) {
    document.write(
      `&lt;div&gt;&lt;button onclick=&quot;methods.${method}()&quot;&gt;${method}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`
    );
  }

  methods.resetExample();
&lt;/script&gt;
```

There also exist methods to compare ranges, but these are rarely used. When you need them, please refer to the [spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-range) or [MDN manual](mdn:/api/Range).

## Selection

`Range` is a generic object for managing selection ranges. Although, creating a `Range` doesn&#39;t mean that we see a selection on screen.

We may create `Range` objects, pass them around -- they do not visually select anything on their own.

The document selection is represented by `Selection` object, that can be obtained as `window.getSelection()` or `document.getSelection()`. A selection may include zero or more ranges. At least, the [Selection API specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/) says so. In practice though, only Firefox allows to select multiple ranges in the document by using `key:Ctrl+click` (`key:Cmd+click` for Mac).

Here&#39;s a screenshot of a selection with 3 ranges, made in Firefox:

![](selection-firefox.svg)

Other browsers support at maximum 1 range. As we&#39;ll see, some of `Selection` methods imply that there may be many ranges, but again, in all browsers except Firefox, there&#39;s at maximum 1.

Here&#39;s a small demo that shows the current selection (select something and click) as text:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert(document.getSelection())&quot;&gt;alert(document.getSelection())&lt;/button&gt;

## Selection properties

As said, a selection may in theory contain multiple ranges. We can get these range objects using the method:

- `getRangeAt(i)` -- get i-th range, starting from `0`. In all browsers except Firefox, only `0` is used.

Also, there exist properties that often provide better convenience.

Similar to a range, a selection object has a start, called &quot;anchor&quot;, and the end, called &quot;focus&quot;.

The main selection properties are:

- `anchorNode` -- the node where the selection starts,
- `anchorOffset` -- the offset in `anchorNode` where the selection starts,
- `focusNode` -- the node where the selection ends,
- `focusOffset` -- the offset in `focusNode` where the selection ends,
- `isCollapsed` -- `true` if selection selects nothing (empty range), or doesn&#39;t exist.
- `rangeCount` -- count of ranges in the selection, maximum `1` in all browsers except Firefox.

```smart header=&quot;Selection end/start vs Range&quot;

There&#39;s an important differences of a selection anchor/focus compared with a `Range` start/end.

As we know, `Range` objects always have their start before the end.

For selections, that&#39;s not always the case.

Selecting something with a mouse can be done in both directions: either &quot;left-to-right&quot; or &quot;right-to-left&quot;.

In other words, when the mouse button is pressed, and then it moves forward in the document, then its end (focus) will be after its start (anchor).

E.g. if the user starts selecting with mouse and goes from &quot;Example&quot; to &quot;italic&quot;:

![](selection-direction-forward.svg)

...But the same selection could be done backwards: starting from  &quot;italic&quot; to &quot;Example&quot; (backward direction), then its end (focus) will be before the start (anchor):

![](selection-direction-backward.svg)
```

## Selection events

There are events on to keep track of selection:

- `elem.onselectstart` -- when a selection _starts_ specifically on element `elem` (or inside it). For instance, when the user presses the mouse button on it and starts to move the pointer.
  - Preventing the default action cancels the selection start. So starting a selection from this element becomes impossible, but the element is still selectable. The visitor just needs to start the selection from elsewhere.
- `document.onselectionchange` -- whenever a selection changes or starts.
  - Please note: this handler can be set only on `document`, it tracks all selections in it.

### Selection tracking demo

Here&#39;s a small demo. It tracks the current selection on the `document` and shows its boundaries:

```html run height=80
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Select me: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;input id=&quot;from&quot; disabled /&gt; – To &lt;input id=&quot;to&quot; disabled /&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  document.onselectionchange = function () {
    let selection = document.getSelection();

    let { anchorNode, anchorOffset, focusNode, focusOffset } = selection;

    // anchorNode and focusNode are text nodes usually
    from.value = `${anchorNode?.data}, offset ${anchorOffset}`;
    to.value = `${focusNode?.data}, offset ${focusOffset}`;
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

### Selection copying demo

There are two approaches to copying the selected content:

1. We can use `document.getSelection().toString()` to get it as text.
2. Otherwise, to copy the full DOM, e.g. if we need to keep formatting, we can get the underlying ranges with `getRangesAt(...)`. A `Range` object, in turn, has `cloneContents()` method that clones its content and returns as `DocumentFragment` object, that we can insert elsewhere.

Here&#39;s the demo of copying the selected content both as text and as DOM nodes:

```html run height=100
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Select me: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cloned: &lt;span id=&quot;cloned&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As text: &lt;span id=&quot;astext&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.onselectionchange = function () {
    let selection = document.getSelection();

    cloned.innerHTML = astext.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;;

    // Clone DOM nodes from ranges (we support multiselect here)
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; selection.rangeCount; i++) {
      cloned.append(selection.getRangeAt(i).cloneContents());
    }

    // Get as text
    astext.innerHTML += selection;
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Selection methods

We can work with the selection by addding/removing ranges:

- `getRangeAt(i)` -- get i-th range, starting from `0`. In all browsers except Firefox, only `0` is used.
- `addRange(range)` -- add `range` to selection. All browsers except Firefox ignore the call, if the selection already has an associated range.
- `removeRange(range)` -- remove `range` from the selection.
- `removeAllRanges()` -- remove all ranges.
- `empty()` -- alias to `removeAllRanges`.

There are also convenience methods to manipulate the selection range directly, without intermediate `Range` calls:

- `collapse(node, offset)` -- replace selected range with a new one that starts and ends at the given `node`, at position `offset`.
- `setPosition(node, offset)` -- alias to `collapse`.
- `collapseToStart()` - collapse (replace with an empty range) to selection start,
- `collapseToEnd()` - collapse to selection end,
- `extend(node, offset)` - move focus of the selection to the given `node`, position `offset`,
- `setBaseAndExtent(anchorNode, anchorOffset, focusNode, focusOffset)` - replace selection range with the given start `anchorNode/anchorOffset` and end `focusNode/focusOffset`. All content in-between them is selected.
- `selectAllChildren(node)` -- select all children of the `node`.
- `deleteFromDocument()` -- remove selected content from the document.
- `containsNode(node, allowPartialContainment = false)` -- checks whether the selection contains `node` (partially if the second argument is `true`)

For most tasks these methods are just fine, there&#39;s no need to access the underlying `Range` object.

For example, selecting the whole contents of the paragraph `&lt;p&gt;`:

```html run
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Select me: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  // select from 0th child of &lt;p&gt; to the last child
  document.getSelection().setBaseAndExtent(p, 0, p, p.childNodes.length);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The same thing using ranges:

```html run
&lt;p id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;Select me: &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let range = new Range();
  range.selectNodeContents(p); // or selectNode(p) to select the &lt;p&gt; tag too

  document.getSelection().removeAllRanges(); // clear existing selection if any
  document.getSelection().addRange(range);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;To select something, remove the existing selection first&quot;
If a document selection already exists, empty it first with `removeAllRanges()`. And then add ranges. Otherwise, all browsers except Firefox ignore new ranges.

The exception is some selection methods, that replace the existing selection, such as `setBaseAndExtent`.
```

## Selection in form controls

Form elements, such as `input` and `textarea` provide [special API for selection](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#textFieldSelection), without `Selection` or `Range` objects. As an input value is a pure text, not HTML, there&#39;s no need for such objects, everything&#39;s much simpler.

Properties:

- `input.selectionStart` -- position of selection start (writeable),
- `input.selectionEnd` -- position of selection end (writeable),
- `input.selectionDirection` -- selection direction, one of: &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;none&quot; (if e.g. selected with a double mouse click),

Events:

- `input.onselect` -- triggers when something is selected.

Methods:

- `input.select()` -- selects everything in the text control (can be `textarea` instead of `input`),
- `input.setSelectionRange(start, end, [direction])` -- change the selection to span from position `start` till `end`, in the given direction (optional).
- `input.setRangeText(replacement, [start], [end], [selectionMode])` -- replace a range of text with the new text.

  Optional arguments `start` and `end`, if provided, set the range start and end, otherwise user selection is used.

  The last argument, `selectionMode`, determines how the selection will be set after the text has been replaced. The possible values are:

  - `&quot;select&quot;` -- the newly inserted text will be selected.
  - `&quot;start&quot;` -- the selection range collapses just before the inserted text (the cursor will be immediately before it).
  - `&quot;end&quot;` -- the selection range collapses just after the inserted text (the cursor will be right after it).
  - `&quot;preserve&quot;` -- attempts to preserve the selection. This is the default.

Now let&#39;s see these methods in action.

### Example: tracking selection

For example, this code uses `onselect` event to track selection:

```html run autorun
&lt;textarea id=&quot;area&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;height:60px&quot;&gt;
Selecting in this text updates values below.
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From &lt;input id=&quot;from&quot; disabled /&gt; – To &lt;input id=&quot;to&quot; disabled /&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  area.onselect = function () {
    from.value = area.selectionStart;
    to.value = area.selectionEnd;
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Please note:

- `onselect` triggers when something is selected, but not when the selection is removed.
- `document.onselectionchange` event should not trigger for selections inside a form control, according to the [spec](https://w3c.github.io/selection-api/#dfn-selectionchange), as it&#39;s not related to `document` selection and ranges. Some browsers generate it, but we shouldn&#39;t rely on it.

### Example: moving cursor

We can change `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd`, that sets the selection.

An important edge case is when `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` equal each other. Then it&#39;s exactly the cursor position. Or, to rephrase, when nothing is selected, the selection is collapsed at the cursor position.

So, by setting `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` to the same value, we move the cursor.

For example:

```html run autorun
&lt;textarea id=&quot;area&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;height:60px&quot;&gt;
Focus on me, the cursor will be at position 10.
&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  area.onfocus = () =&gt; {
    // zero delay setTimeout to run after browser &quot;focus&quot; action finishes
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      // we can set any selection
      // if start=end, the cursor is exactly at that place
      area.selectionStart = area.selectionEnd = 10;
    });
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

### Example: modifying selection

To modify the content of the selection, we can use `input.setRangeText()` method. Of course, we can read `selectionStart/End` and, with the knowledge of the selection, change the corresponding substring of `value`, but `setRangeText` is more powerful and often more convenient.

That&#39;s a somewhat complex method. In its simplest one-argument form it replaces the user selected range and removes the selection.

For example, here the user selection will be wrapped by `*...*`:

```html run autorun
&lt;input
  id=&quot;input&quot;
  style=&quot;width:200px&quot;
  value=&quot;Select here and click the button&quot;
/&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Wrap selection in stars *...*&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  button.onclick = () =&gt; {
    if (input.selectionStart == input.selectionEnd) {
      return; // nothing is selected
    }

    let selected = input.value.slice(input.selectionStart, input.selectionEnd);
    input.setRangeText(`*${selected}*`);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

With more arguments, we can set range `start` and `end`.

In this example we find `&quot;THIS&quot;` in the input text, replace it and keep the replacement selected:

```html run autorun
&lt;input id=&quot;input&quot; style=&quot;width:200px&quot; value=&quot;Replace THIS in text&quot; /&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Replace THIS&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  button.onclick = () =&gt; {
    let pos = input.value.indexOf(&quot;THIS&quot;);
    if (pos &gt;= 0) {
      input.setRangeText(&quot;*THIS*&quot;, pos, pos + 4, &quot;select&quot;);
      input.focus(); // focus to make selection visible
    }
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

### Example: insert at cursor

If nothing is selected, or we use equal `start` and `end` in `setRangeText`, then the new text is just inserted, nothing is removed.

We can also insert something &quot;at the cursor&quot; using `setRangeText`.

Here&#39;s a button that inserts `&quot;HELLO&quot;` at the cursor position and puts the cursor immediately after it. If the selection is not empty, then it gets replaced (we can detect it by comparing `selectionStart!=selectionEnd` and do something else instead):

```html run autorun
&lt;input id=&quot;input&quot; style=&quot;width:200px&quot; value=&quot;Text Text Text Text Text&quot; /&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Insert &quot;HELLO&quot; at cursor&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  button.onclick = () =&gt; {
    input.setRangeText(
      &quot;HELLO&quot;,
      input.selectionStart,
      input.selectionEnd,
      &quot;end&quot;
    );
    input.focus();
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Making unselectable

To make something unselectable, there are three ways:

1. Use CSS property `user-select: none`.

   ```html run
   &lt;style&gt;
     #elem {
       user-select: none;
     }
   &lt;/style&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
     Selectable
     &lt;div id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Unselectable&lt;/div&gt;
     Selectable
   &lt;/div&gt;
   ```

   This doesn&#39;t allow the selection to start at `elem`. But the user may start the selection elsewhere and include `elem` into it.

   Then `elem` will become a part of `document.getSelection()`, so the selection actually happens, but its content is usually ignored in copy-paste.

2. Prevent default action in `onselectstart` or `mousedown` events.

   ```html run
   &lt;div&gt;
     Selectable
     &lt;div id=&quot;elem&quot;&gt;Unselectable&lt;/div&gt;
     Selectable
   &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;script&gt;
     elem.onselectstart = () =&gt; false;
   &lt;/script&gt;
   ```

   This prevents starting the selection on `elem`, but the visitor may start it at another element, then extend to `elem`.

   That&#39;s convenient when there&#39;s another event handler on the same action that triggers the select (e.g. `mousedown`). So we disable the selection to avoid conflict, still allowing `elem` contents to be copied.

3. We can also clear the selection post-factum after it happens with `document.getSelection().empty()`. That&#39;s rarely used, as this causes unwanted blinking as the selection appears-disappears.

## Summary

We covered two different APIs for selections:

1. For document: `Selection` and `Range` objects.
2. For `input`, `textarea`: additional methods and properties.

The second API is very simple, as it works with text.

The most used recipes are probably:

1. Getting the selection:

   ```js
   let selection = document.getSelection();

   let cloned = /* element to clone the selected nodes to */;

   // then apply Range methods to selection.getRangeAt(0)
   // or, like here, to all ranges to support multi-select
   for (let i = 0; i &lt; selection.rangeCount; i++) {
     cloned.append(selection.getRangeAt(i).cloneContents());
   }
   ```

2. Setting the selection:

   ```js
   let selection = document.getSelection();

   // directly:
   selection.setBaseAndExtent(...from...to...);

   // or we can create a range and:
   selection.removeAllRanges();
   selection.addRange(range);
   ```

And finally, about the cursor. The cursor position in editable elements, like `&lt;textarea&gt;` is always at the start or the end of the selection. We can use it to get cursor position or to move the cursor by setting `elem.selectionStart` and `elem.selectionEnd`.

# Event loop: microtasks and macrotasks

Browser JavaScript execution flow, as well as in Node.js, is based on an _event loop_.

Understanding how event loop works is important for optimizations, and sometimes for the right architecture.

In this chapter we first cover theoretical details about how things work, and then see practical applications of that knowledge.

## Event Loop

The _event loop_ concept is very simple. There&#39;s an endless loop, where the JavaScript engine waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps, waiting for more tasks.

The general algorithm of the engine:

1. While there are tasks:
   - execute them, starting with the oldest task.
2. Sleep until a task appears, then go to 1.

That&#39;s a formalization for what we see when browsing a page. The JavaScript engine does nothing most of the time, it only runs if a script/handler/event activates.

Examples of tasks:

- When an external script `&lt;script src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;` loads, the task is to execute it.
- When a user moves their mouse, the task is to dispatch `mousemove` event and execute handlers.
- When the time is due for a scheduled `setTimeout`, the task is to run its callback.
- ...and so on.

Tasks are set -- the engine handles them -- then waits for more tasks (while sleeping and consuming close to zero CPU).

It may happen that a task comes while the engine is busy, then it&#39;s enqueued.

The tasks form a queue, so-called &quot;macrotask queue&quot; (v8 term):

![](eventLoop.svg)

For instance, while the engine is busy executing a `script`, a user may move their mouse causing `mousemove`, and `setTimeout` may be due and so on, these tasks form a queue, as illustrated on the picture above.

Tasks from the queue are processed on &quot;first come – first served&quot; basis. When the engine browser is done with the `script`, it handles `mousemove` event, then `setTimeout` handler, and so on.

So far, quite simple, right?

Two more details:

1. Rendering never happens while the engine executes a task. It doesn&#39;t matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to the DOM are painted only after the task is complete.
2. If a task takes too long, the browser can&#39;t do other tasks, such as processing user events. So after a time, it raises an alert like &quot;Page Unresponsive&quot;, suggesting killing the task with the whole page. That happens when there are a lot of complex calculations or a programming error leading to an infinite loop.

That was the theory. Now let&#39;s see how we can apply that knowledge.

## Use-case 1: splitting CPU-hungry tasks

Let&#39;s say we have a CPU-hungry task.

For example, syntax-highlighting (used to colorize code examples on this page) is quite CPU-heavy. To highlight the code, it performs the analysis, creates many colored elements, adds them to the document -- for a large amount of text that takes a lot of time.

While the engine is busy with syntax highlighting, it can&#39;t do other DOM-related stuff, process user events, etc. It may even cause the browser to &quot;hiccup&quot; or even &quot;hang&quot; for a bit, which is unacceptable.

We can avoid problems by splitting the big task into pieces. Highlight first 100 lines, then schedule `setTimeout` (with zero-delay) for the next 100 lines, and so on.

To demonstrate this approach, for the sake of simplicity, instead of text-highlighting, let&#39;s take a function that counts from `1` to `1000000000`.

If you run the code below, the engine will &quot;hang&quot; for some time. For server-side JS that&#39;s clearly noticeable, and if you are running it in-browser, then try to click other buttons on the page -- you&#39;ll see that no other events get handled until the counting finishes.

```js run
let i = 0;

let start = Date.now();

function count() {
  // do a heavy job
  for (let j = 0; j &lt; 1e9; j++) {
    i++;
  }

  alert(&quot;Done in &quot; + (Date.now() - start) + &quot;ms&quot;);
}

count();
```

The browser may even show a &quot;the script takes too long&quot; warning.

Let&#39;s split the job using nested `setTimeout` calls:

```js run
let i = 0;

let start = Date.now();

function count() {
  // do a piece of the heavy job (*)
  do {
    i++;
  } while (i % 1e6 != 0);

  if (i == 1e9) {
    alert(&quot;Done in &quot; + (Date.now() - start) + &quot;ms&quot;);
  } else {
    setTimeout(count); // schedule the new call (**)
  }
}

count();
```

Now the browser interface is fully functional during the &quot;counting&quot; process.

A single run of `count` does a part of the job `(*)`, and then re-schedules itself `(**)` if needed:

1. First run counts: `i=1...1000000`.
2. Second run counts: `i=1000001..2000000`.
3. ...and so on.

Now, if a new side task (e.g. `onclick` event) appears while the engine is busy executing part 1, it gets queued and then executes when part 1 finished, before the next part. Periodic returns to the event loop between `count` executions provide just enough &quot;air&quot; for the JavaScript engine to do something else, to react to other user actions.

The notable thing is that both variants -- with and without splitting the job by `setTimeout` -- are comparable in speed. There&#39;s not much difference in the overall counting time.

To make them closer, let&#39;s make an improvement.

We&#39;ll move the scheduling to the beginning of the `count()`:

```js run
let i = 0;

let start = Date.now();

function count() {
  // move the scheduling to the beginning
  if (i &lt; 1e9 - 1e6) {
    setTimeout(count); // schedule the new call
  }

  do {
    i++;
  } while (i % 1e6 != 0);

  if (i == 1e9) {
    alert(&quot;Done in &quot; + (Date.now() - start) + &quot;ms&quot;);
  }
}

count();
```

Now when we start to `count()` and see that we&#39;ll need to `count()` more, we schedule that immediately, before doing the job.

If you run it, it&#39;s easy to notice that it takes significantly less time.

Why?

That&#39;s simple: as you remember, there&#39;s the in-browser minimal delay of 4ms for many nested `setTimeout` calls. Even if we set `0`, it&#39;s `4ms` (or a bit more). So the earlier we schedule it - the faster it runs.

Finally, we&#39;ve split a CPU-hungry task into parts - now it doesn&#39;t block the user interface. And its overall execution time isn&#39;t much longer.

## Use case 2: progress indication

Another benefit of splitting heavy tasks for browser scripts is that we can show progress indication.

As mentioned earlier, changes to DOM are painted only after the currently running task is completed, irrespective of how long it takes.

On one hand, that&#39;s great, because our function may create many elements, add them one-by-one to the document and change their styles -- the visitor won&#39;t see any &quot;intermediate&quot;, unfinished state. An important thing, right?

Here&#39;s the demo, the changes to `i` won&#39;t show up until the function finishes, so we&#39;ll see only the last value:

```html run
&lt;div id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function count() {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1e6; i++) {
      i++;
      progress.innerHTML = i;
    }
  }

  count();
&lt;/script&gt;
```

...But we also may want to show something during the task, e.g. a progress bar.

If we split the heavy task into pieces using `setTimeout`, then changes are painted out in-between them.

This looks prettier:

```html run
&lt;div id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let i = 0;

  function count() {
    // do a piece of the heavy job (*)
    do {
      i++;
      progress.innerHTML = i;
    } while (i % 1e3 != 0);

    if (i &lt; 1e7) {
      setTimeout(count);
    }
  }

  count();
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Now the `&lt;div&gt;` shows increasing values of `i`, a kind of a progress bar.

## Use case 3: doing something after the event

In an event handler we may decide to postpone some actions until the event bubbled up and was handled on all levels. We can do that by wrapping the code in zero delay `setTimeout`.

In the chapter &lt;info:dispatch-events&gt; we saw an example: custom event `menu-open` is dispatched in `setTimeout`, so that it happens after the &quot;click&quot; event is fully handled.

```js
menu.onclick = function () {
  // ...

  // create a custom event with the clicked menu item data
  let customEvent = new CustomEvent(&quot;menu-open&quot;, {
    bubbles: true,
  });

  // dispatch the custom event asynchronously
  setTimeout(() =&gt; menu.dispatchEvent(customEvent));
};
```

## Macrotasks and Microtasks

Along with _macrotasks_, described in this chapter, there are _microtasks_, mentioned in the chapter &lt;info:microtask-queue&gt;.

Microtasks come solely from our code. They are usually created by promises: an execution of `.then/catch/finally` handler becomes a microtask. Microtasks are used &quot;under the cover&quot; of `await` as well, as it&#39;s another form of promise handling.

There&#39;s also a special function `queueMicrotask(func)` that queues `func` for execution in the microtask queue.

**Immediately after every _macrotask_, the engine executes all tasks from _microtask_ queue, prior to running any other macrotasks or rendering or anything else.**

For instance, take a look:

```js run
setTimeout(() =&gt; alert(&quot;timeout&quot;));

Promise.resolve().then(() =&gt; alert(&quot;promise&quot;));

alert(&quot;code&quot;);
```

What&#39;s going to be the order here?

1. `code` shows first, because it&#39;s a regular synchronous call.
2. `promise` shows second, because `.then` passes through the microtask queue, and runs after the current code.
3. `timeout` shows last, because it&#39;s a macrotask.

The richer event loop picture looks like this (order is from top to bottom, that is: the script first, then microtasks, rendering and so on):

![](eventLoop-full.svg)

All microtasks are completed before any other event handling or rendering or any other macrotask takes place.

That&#39;s important, as it guarantees that the application environment is basically the same (no mouse coordinate changes, no new network data, etc) between microtasks.

If we&#39;d like to execute a function asynchronously (after the current code), but before changes are rendered or new events handled, we can schedule it with `queueMicrotask`.

Here&#39;s an example with &quot;counting progress bar&quot;, similar to the one shown previously, but `queueMicrotask` is used instead of `setTimeout`. You can see that it renders at the very end. Just like the synchronous code:

```html run
&lt;div id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let i = 0;

  function count() {

    // do a piece of the heavy job (*)
    do {
      i++;
      progress.innerHTML = i;
    } while (i % 1e3 != 0);

    if (i &lt; 1e6) {
  *!*
      queueMicrotask(count);
  */!*
    }

  }

  count();
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Summary

A more detailed event loop algorithm (though still simplified compared to the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model)):

1. Dequeue and run the oldest task from the _macrotask_ queue (e.g. &quot;script&quot;).
2. Execute all _microtasks_:
   - While the microtask queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue and run the oldest microtask.
3. Render changes if any.
4. If the macrotask queue is empty, wait till a macrotask appears.
5. Go to step 1.

To schedule a new _macrotask_:

- Use zero delayed `setTimeout(f)`.

That may be used to split a big calculation-heavy task into pieces, for the browser to be able to react to user events and show progress between them.

Also, used in event handlers to schedule an action after the event is fully handled (bubbling done).

To schedule a new _microtask_

- Use `queueMicrotask(f)`.
- Also promise handlers go through the microtask queue.

There&#39;s no UI or network event handling between microtasks: they run immediately one after another.

So one may want to `queueMicrotask` to execute a function asynchronously, but within the environment state.

```smart header=&quot;Web Workers&quot;
For long heavy calculations that shouldn&#39;t block the event loop, we can use [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html).

That&#39;s a way to run code in another, parallel thread.

Web Workers can exchange messages with the main process, but they have their own variables, and their own event loop.

Web Workers do not have access to DOM, so they are useful, mainly, for calculations, to use multiple CPU cores simultaneously.
```

# Popups and window methods

A popup window is one of the oldest methods to show additional document to user.

Basically, you just run:

```js
window.open(&quot;https://javascript.info/&quot;);
```

...And it will open a new window with given URL. Most modern browsers are configured to open url in new tabs instead of separate windows.

Popups exist from really ancient times. The initial idea was to show another content without closing the main window. As of now, there are other ways to do that: we can load content dynamically with [fetch](info:fetch) and show it in a dynamically generated `&lt;div&gt;`. So, popups is not something we use everyday.

Also, popups are tricky on mobile devices, that don&#39;t show multiple windows simultaneously.

Still, there are tasks where popups are still used, e.g. for OAuth authorization (login with Google/Facebook/...), because:

1. A popup is a separate window which has its own independent JavaScript environment. So opening a popup from a third-party, non-trusted site is safe.
2. It&#39;s very easy to open a popup.
3. A popup can navigate (change URL) and send messages to the opener window.

## Popup blocking

In the past, evil sites abused popups a lot. A bad page could open tons of popup windows with ads. So now most browsers try to block popups and protect the user.

**Most browsers block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like `onclick`.**

For example:

```js
// popup blocked
window.open(&quot;https://javascript.info&quot;);

// popup allowed
button.onclick = () =&gt; {
  window.open(&quot;https://javascript.info&quot;);
};
```

This way users are somewhat protected from unwanted popups, but the functionality is not disabled totally.

What if the popup opens from `onclick`, but after `setTimeout`? That&#39;s a bit tricky.

Try this code:

```js run
// open after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() =&gt; window.open(&quot;http://google.com&quot;), 3000);
```

The popup opens in Chrome, but gets blocked in Firefox.

...If we decrease the delay, the popup works in Firefox too:

```js run
// open after 1 seconds
setTimeout(() =&gt; window.open(&quot;http://google.com&quot;), 1000);
```

The difference is that Firefox treats a timeout of 2000ms or less are acceptable, but after it -- removes the &quot;trust&quot;, assuming that now it&#39;s &quot;outside of the user action&quot;. So the first one is blocked, and the second one is not.

## window.open

The syntax to open a popup is: `window.open(url, name, params)`:

url
: An URL to load into the new window.

name
: A name of the new window. Each window has a `window.name`, and here we can specify which window to use for the popup. If there&#39;s already a window with such name -- the given URL opens in it, otherwise a new window is opened.

params
: The configuration string for the new window. It contains settings, delimited by a comma. There must be no spaces in params, for instance: `width=200,height=100`.

Settings for `params`:

- Position:
  - `left/top` (numeric) -- coordinates of the window top-left corner on the screen. There is a limitation: a new window cannot be positioned offscreen.
  - `width/height` (numeric) -- width and height of a new window. There is a limit on minimal width/height, so it&#39;s impossible to create an invisible window.
- Window features:
  - `menubar` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the browser menu on the new window.
  - `toolbar` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the browser navigation bar (back, forward, reload etc) on the new window.
  - `location` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the URL field in the new window. FF and IE don&#39;t allow to hide it by default.
  - `status` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the status bar. Again, most browsers force it to show.
  - `resizable` (yes/no) -- allows to disable the resize for the new window. Not recommended.
  - `scrollbars` (yes/no) -- allows to disable the scrollbars for the new window. Not recommended.

There is also a number of less supported browser-specific features, which are usually not used. Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.open&quot;&gt;window.open in MDN&lt;/a&gt; for examples.

## Example: a minimalistic window

Let&#39;s open a window with minimal set of features, just to see which of them browser allows to disable:

```js run
let params = `scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,
width=0,height=0,left=-1000,top=-1000`;

open(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, params);
```

Here most &quot;window features&quot; are disabled and window is positioned offscreen. Run it and see what really happens. Most browsers &quot;fix&quot; odd things like zero `width/height` and offscreen `left/top`. For instance, Chrome open such a window with full width/height, so that it occupies the full screen.

Let&#39;s add normal positioning options and reasonable `width`, `height`, `left`, `top` coordinates:

```js run
let params = `scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,
width=600,height=300,left=100,top=100`;

open(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, params);
```

Most browsers show the example above as required.

Rules for omitted settings:

- If there is no 3rd argument in the `open` call, or it is empty, then the default window parameters are used.
- If there is a string of params, but some `yes/no` features are omitted, then the omitted features assumed to have `no` value. So if you specify params, make sure you explicitly set all required features to yes.
- If there is no `left/top` in params, then the browser tries to open a new window near the last opened window.
- If there is no `width/height`, then the new window will be the same size as the last opened.

## Accessing popup from window

The `open` call returns a reference to the new window. It can be used to manipulate it&#39;s properties, change location and even more.

In this example, we generate popup content from JavaScript:

```js
let newWin = window.open(&quot;about:blank&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;width=200,height=200&quot;);

newWin.document.write(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
```

And here we modify the contents after loading:

```js run
let newWindow = open(&#39;/&#39;, &#39;example&#39;, &#39;width=300,height=300&#39;)
newWindow.focus();

alert(newWindow.location.href); // (*) about:blank, loading hasn&#39;t started yet

newWindow.onload = function() {
  let html = `&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:30px&quot;&gt;Welcome!&lt;/div&gt;`;
*!*
  newWindow.document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(&#39;afterbegin&#39;, html);
*/!*
};
```

Please note: immediately after `window.open`, the new window isn&#39;t loaded yet. That&#39;s demonstrated by `alert` in line `(*)`. So we wait for `onload` to modify it. We could also use `DOMContentLoaded` handler for `newWin.document`.

```warn header=&quot;Same origin policy&quot;
Windows may freely access content of each other only if they come from the same origin (the same protocol://domain:port).

Otherwise, e.g. if the main window is from `site.com`, and the popup from `gmail.com`, that&#39;s impossible for user safety reasons. For the details, see chapter &lt;info:cross-window-communication&gt;.
```

## Accessing window from popup

A popup may access the &quot;opener&quot; window as well using `window.opener` reference. It is `null` for all windows except popups.

If you run the code below, it replaces the opener (current) window content with &quot;Test&quot;:

```js run
let newWin = window.open(&quot;about:blank&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;width=200,height=200&quot;);

newWin.document.write(
  &quot;&lt;script&gt;window.opener.document.body.innerHTML = &#39;Test&#39;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;
);
```

So the connection between the windows is bidirectional: the main window and the popup have a reference to each other.

## Closing a popup

To close a window: `win.close()`.

To check if a window is closed: `win.closed`.

Technically, the `close()` method is available for any `window`, but `window.close()` is ignored by most browsers if `window` is not created with `window.open()`. So it&#39;ll only work on a popup.

The `closed` property is `true` if the window is closed. That&#39;s useful to check if the popup (or the main window) is still open or not. A user can close it anytime, and our code should take that possibility into account.

This code loads and then closes the window:

```js run
let newWindow = open(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;width=300,height=300&quot;);

newWindow.onload = function () {
  newWindow.close();
  alert(newWindow.closed); // true
};
```

## Moving and resizing

There are methods to move/resize a window:

`win.moveBy(x,y)`
: Move the window relative to current position `x` pixels to the right and `y` pixels down. Negative values are allowed (to move left/up).

`win.moveTo(x,y)`
: Move the window to coordinates `(x,y)` on the screen.

`win.resizeBy(width,height)`
: Resize the window by given `width/height` relative to the current size. Negative values are allowed.

`win.resizeTo(width,height)`
: Resize the window to the given size.

There&#39;s also `window.onresize` event.

```warn header=&quot;Only popups&quot;
To prevent abuse, the browser usually blocks these methods. They only work reliably on popups that we opened, that have no additional tabs.
```

```warn header=&quot;No minification/maximization&quot;
JavaScript has no way to minify or maximize a window. These OS-level functions are hidden from Frontend-developers.

Move/resize methods do not work for maximized/minimized windows.
```

## Scrolling a window

We already talked about scrolling a window in the chapter &lt;info:size-and-scroll-window&gt;.

`win.scrollBy(x,y)`
: Scroll the window `x` pixels right and `y` down relative the current scroll. Negative values are allowed.

`win.scrollTo(x,y)`
: Scroll the window to the given coordinates `(x,y)`.

`elem.scrollIntoView(top = true)`
: Scroll the window to make `elem` show up at the top (the default) or at the bottom for `elem.scrollIntoView(false)`.

There&#39;s also `window.onscroll` event.

## Focus/blur on a window

Theoretically, there are `window.focus()` and `window.blur()` methods to focus/unfocus on a window. And there are also `focus/blur` events that allow to catch the moment when the visitor focuses on a window and switches elsewhere.

Although, in practice they are severely limited, because in the past evil pages abused them.

For instance, look at this code:

```js run
window.onblur = () =&gt; window.focus();
```

When a user attempts to switch out of the window (`window.onblur`), it brings the window back into focus. The intention is to &quot;lock&quot; the user within the `window`.

So browsers had to introduce many limitations to forbid the code like that and protect the user from ads and evils pages. They depend on the browser.

For instance, a mobile browser usually ignores `window.focus()` completely. Also focusing doesn&#39;t work when a popup opens in a separate tab rather than a new window.

Still, there are some use cases when such calls do work and can be useful.

For instance:

- When we open a popup, it&#39;s might be a good idea to run a `newWindow.focus()` on it. Just in case, for some OS/browser combinations it ensures that the user is in the new window now.
- If we want to track when a visitor actually uses our web-app, we can track `window.onfocus/onblur`. That allows us to suspend/resume in-page activities, animations etc. But please note that the `blur` event means that the visitor switched out from the window, but they still may observe it. The window is in the background, but still may be visible.

## Summary

Popup windows are used rarely, as there are alternatives: loading and displaying information in-page, or in iframe.

If we&#39;re going to open a popup, a good practice is to inform the user about it. An &quot;opening window&quot; icon near a link or button would allow the visitor to survive the focus shift and keep both windows in mind.

- A popup can be opened by the `open(url, name, params)` call. It returns the reference to the newly opened window.
- Browsers block `open` calls from the code outside of user actions. Usually a notification appears, so that a user may allow them.
- Browsers open a new tab by default, but if sizes are provided, then it&#39;ll be a popup window.
- The popup may access the opener window using the `window.opener` property.
- The main window and the popup can freely read and modify each other if they have the same origin. Otherwise, they can change location of each other and [exchange messages](info:cross-window-communication).

To close the popup: use `close()` call. Also the user may close them (just like any other windows). The `window.closed` is `true` after that.

- Methods `focus()` and `blur()` allow to focus/unfocus a window. But they don&#39;t work all the time.
- Events `focus` and `blur` allow to track switching in and out of the window. But please note that a window may still be visible even in the background state, after `blur`.

# Cross-window communication

The &quot;Same Origin&quot; (same site) policy limits access of windows and frames to each other.

The idea is that if a user has two pages open: one from `john-smith.com`, and another one is `gmail.com`, then they wouldn&#39;t want a script from `john-smith.com` to read our mail from `gmail.com`. So, the purpose of the &quot;Same Origin&quot; policy is to protect users from information theft.

## Same Origin [#same-origin]

Two URLs are said to have the &quot;same origin&quot; if they have the same protocol, domain and port.

These URLs all share the same origin:

- `http://site.com`
- `http://site.com/`
- `http://site.com/my/page.html`

These ones do not:

- &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;b&gt;www.&lt;/b&gt;site.com&lt;/code&gt; (another domain: `www.` matters)
- &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;b&gt;site.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (another domain: `.org` matters)
- &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;https://&lt;/b&gt;site.com&lt;/code&gt; (another protocol: `https`)
- &lt;code&gt;http://site.com:&lt;b&gt;8080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (another port: `8080`)

The &quot;Same Origin&quot; policy states that:

- if we have a reference to another window, e.g. a popup created by `window.open` or a window inside `&lt;iframe&gt;`, and that window comes from the same origin, then we have full access to that window.
- otherwise, if it comes from another origin, then we can&#39;t access the content of that window: variables, document, anything. The only exception is `location`: we can change it (thus redirecting the user). But we cannot _read_ location (so we can&#39;t see where the user is now, no information leak).

### In action: iframe

An `&lt;iframe&gt;` tag hosts a separate embedded window, with its own separate `document` and `window` objects.

We can access them using properties:

- `iframe.contentWindow` to get the window inside the `&lt;iframe&gt;`.
- `iframe.contentDocument` to get the document inside the `&lt;iframe&gt;`, shorthand for `iframe.contentWindow.document`.

When we access something inside the embedded window, the browser checks if the iframe has the same origin. If that&#39;s not so then the access is denied (writing to `location` is an exception, it&#39;s still permitted).

For instance, let&#39;s try reading and writing to `&lt;iframe&gt;` from another origin:

```html run
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://example.com&quot; id=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    iframe.onload = function() {
      // we can get the reference to the inner window
  *!*
      let iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow; // OK
  */!*
      try {
        // ...but not to the document inside it
  *!*
        let doc = iframe.contentDocument; // ERROR
  */!*
      } catch(e) {
        alert(e); // Security Error (another origin)
      }

      // also we can&#39;t READ the URL of the page in iframe
      try {
        // Can&#39;t read URL from the Location object
  *!*
        let href = iframe.contentWindow.location.href; // ERROR
  */!*
      } catch(e) {
        alert(e); // Security Error
      }

      // ...we can WRITE into location (and thus load something else into the iframe)!
  *!*
      iframe.contentWindow.location = &#39;/&#39;; // OK
  */!*

      iframe.onload = null; // clear the handler, not to run it after the location change
    };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The code above shows errors for any operations except:

- Getting the reference to the inner window `iframe.contentWindow` - that&#39;s allowed.
- Writing to `location`.

Contrary to that, if the `&lt;iframe&gt;` has the same origin, we can do anything with it:

```html run
&lt;!-- iframe from the same site --&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/&quot; id=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  iframe.onload = function () {
    // just do anything
    iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;`iframe.onload`vs`iframe.contentWindow.onload`&quot; The `iframe.onload`event (on the`&lt;iframe&gt;`tag) is essentially the same as`iframe.contentWindow.onload` (on the embedded window object). It triggers when the embedded window fully loads with all resources.

...But we can&#39;t access `iframe.contentWindow.onload` for an iframe from another origin, so using `iframe.onload`.

````

## Windows on subdomains: document.domain

By definition, two URLs with different domains have different origins.

But if windows share the same second-level domain, for instance `john.site.com`, `peter.site.com` and `site.com` (so that their common second-level domain is `site.com`), we can make the browser ignore that difference, so that they can be treated as coming from the &quot;same origin&quot; for the purposes of cross-window communication.

To make it work, each such window should run the code:

```js
document.domain = &#39;site.com&#39;;
````

That&#39;s all. Now they can interact without limitations. Again, that&#39;s only possible for pages with the same second-level domain.

## Iframe: wrong document pitfall

When an iframe comes from the same origin, and we may access its `document`, there&#39;s a pitfall. It&#39;s not related to cross-origin things, but important to know.

Upon its creation an iframe immediately has a document. But that document is different from the one that loads into it!

So if we do something with the document immediately, that will probably be lost.

Here, look:

```html run
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/&quot; id=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
    iframe.onload = function() {
      let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
  *!*
      // the loaded document is not the same as initial!
      alert(oldDoc == newDoc); // false
  */!*
    };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

We shouldn&#39;t work with the document of a not-yet-loaded iframe, because that&#39;s the _wrong document_. If we set any event handlers on it, they will be ignored.

How to detect the moment when the document is there?

The right document is definitely at place when `iframe.onload` triggers. But it only triggers when the whole iframe with all resources is loaded.

We can try to catch the moment earlier using checks in `setInterval`:

```html run
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/&quot; id=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;

  // every 100 ms check if the document is the new one
  let timer = setInterval(() =&gt; {
    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
    if (newDoc == oldDoc) return;

    alert(&quot;New document is here!&quot;);

    clearInterval(timer); // cancel setInterval, don&#39;t need it any more
  }, 100);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Collection: window.frames

An alternative way to get a window object for `&lt;iframe&gt;` -- is to get it from the named collection `window.frames`:

- By number: `window.frames[0]` -- the window object for the first frame in the document.
- By name: `window.frames.iframeName` -- the window object for the frame with `name=&quot;iframeName&quot;`.

For instance:

```html run
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/&quot; style=&quot;height:80px&quot; name=&quot;win&quot; id=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames[0]); // true
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames.win); // true
&lt;/script&gt;
```

An iframe may have other iframes inside. The corresponding `window` objects form a hierarchy.

Navigation links are:

- `window.frames` -- the collection of &quot;children&quot; windows (for nested frames).
- `window.parent` -- the reference to the &quot;parent&quot; (outer) window.
- `window.top` -- the reference to the topmost parent window.

For instance:

```js run
window.frames[0].parent === window; // true
```

We can use the `top` property to check if the current document is open inside a frame or not:

```js run
if (window == top) {
  // current window == window.top?
  alert(&quot;The script is in the topmost window, not in a frame&quot;);
} else {
  alert(&quot;The script runs in a frame!&quot;);
}
```

## The &quot;sandbox&quot; iframe attribute

The `sandbox` attribute allows for the exclusion of certain actions inside an `&lt;iframe&gt;` in order to prevent it executing untrusted code. It &quot;sandboxes&quot; the iframe by treating it as coming from another origin and/or applying other limitations.

There&#39;s a &quot;default set&quot; of restrictions applied for `&lt;iframe sandbox src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;`. But it can be relaxed if we provide a space-separated list of restrictions that should not be applied as a value of the attribute, like this: `&lt;iframe sandbox=&quot;allow-forms allow-popups&quot;&gt;`.

In other words, an empty `&quot;sandbox&quot;` attribute puts the strictest limitations possible, but we can put a space-delimited list of those that we want to lift.

Here&#39;s a list of limitations:

`allow-same-origin`
: By default `&quot;sandbox&quot;` forces the &quot;different origin&quot; policy for the iframe. In other words, it makes the browser to treat the `iframe` as coming from another origin, even if its `src` points to the same site. With all implied restrictions for scripts. This option removes that feature.

`allow-top-navigation`
: Allows the `iframe` to change `parent.location`.

`allow-forms`
: Allows to submit forms from `iframe`.

`allow-scripts`
: Allows to run scripts from the `iframe`.

`allow-popups`
: Allows to `window.open` popups from the `iframe`

See [the manual](mdn:/HTML/Element/iframe) for more.

The example below demonstrates a sandboxed iframe with the default set of restrictions: `&lt;iframe sandbox src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;`. It has some JavaScript and a form.

Please note that nothing works. So the default set is really harsh:

[codetabs src=&quot;sandbox&quot; height=140]

```smart
The purpose of the `&quot;sandbox&quot;` attribute is only to *add more* restrictions. It cannot remove them. In particular, it can&#39;t relax same-origin restrictions if the iframe comes from another origin.
```

## Cross-window messaging

The `postMessage` interface allows windows to talk to each other no matter which origin they are from.

So, it&#39;s a way around the &quot;Same Origin&quot; policy. It allows a window from `john-smith.com` to talk to `gmail.com` and exchange information, but only if they both agree and call corresponding JavaScript functions. That makes it safe for users.

The interface has two parts.

### postMessage

The window that wants to send a message calls [postMessage](mdn:api/Window.postMessage) method of the receiving window. In other words, if we want to send the message to `win`, we should call `win.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.

Arguments:

`data`
: The data to send. Can be any object, the data is cloned using the &quot;structured serialization algorithm&quot;. IE supports only strings, so we should `JSON.stringify` complex objects to support that browser.

`targetOrigin`
: Specifies the origin for the target window, so that only a window from the given origin will get the message.

The `targetOrigin` is a safety measure. Remember, if the target window comes from another origin, we can&#39;t read it&#39;s `location` in the sender window. So we can&#39;t be sure which site is open in the intended window right now: the user could navigate away, and the sender window has no idea about it.

Specifying `targetOrigin` ensures that the window only receives the data if it&#39;s still at the right site. Important when the data is sensitive.

For instance, here `win` will only receive the message if it has a document from the origin `http://example.com`:

```html no-beautify
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://example.com&quot; name=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    let win = window.frames.example;

    win.postMessage(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;http://example.com&quot;);
  &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/iframe
&gt;
```

If we don&#39;t want that check, we can set `targetOrigin` to `*`.

```html no-beautify
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://example.com&quot; name=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
      let win = window.frames.example;

    *!*
      win.postMessage(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);
    */!*
  &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/iframe
&gt;
```

### onmessage

To receive a message, the target window should have a handler on the `message` event. It triggers when `postMessage` is called (and `targetOrigin` check is successful).

The event object has special properties:

`data`
: The data from `postMessage`.

`origin`
: The origin of the sender, for instance `http://javascript.info`.

`source`
: The reference to the sender window. We can immediately `source.postMessage(...)` back if we want.

To assign that handler, we should use `addEventListener`, a short syntax `window.onmessage` does not work.

Here&#39;s an example:

```js
window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, function (event) {
  if (event.origin != &quot;http://javascript.info&quot;) {
    // something from an unknown domain, let&#39;s ignore it
    return;
  }

  alert(&quot;received: &quot; + event.data);

  // can message back using event.source.postMessage(...)
});
```

The full example:

[codetabs src=&quot;postmessage&quot; height=120]

## Summary

To call methods and access the content of another window, we should first have a reference to it.

For popups we have these references:

- From the opener window: `window.open` -- opens a new window and returns a reference to it,
- From the popup: `window.opener` -- is a reference to the opener window from a popup.

For iframes, we can access parent/children windows using:

- `window.frames` -- a collection of nested window objects,
- `window.parent`, `window.top` are the references to parent and top windows,
- `iframe.contentWindow` is the window inside an `&lt;iframe&gt;` tag.

If windows share the same origin (host, port, protocol), then windows can do whatever they want with each other.

Otherwise, only possible actions are:

- Change the `location` of another window (write-only access).
- Post a message to it.

Exceptions are:

- Windows that share the same second-level domain: `a.site.com` and `b.site.com`. Then setting `document.domain=&#39;site.com&#39;` in both of them puts them into the &quot;same origin&quot; state.
- If an iframe has a `sandbox` attribute, it is forcefully put into the &quot;different origin&quot; state, unless the `allow-same-origin` is specified in the attribute value. That can be used to run untrusted code in iframes from the same site.

The `postMessage` interface allows two windows with any origins to talk:

1. The sender calls `targetWin.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.
2. If `targetOrigin` is not `&#39;*&#39;`, then the browser checks if window `targetWin` has the origin `targetOrigin`.
3. If it is so, then `targetWin` triggers the `message` event with special properties:

   - `origin` -- the origin of the sender window (like `http://my.site.com`)
   - `source` -- the reference to the sender window.
   - `data` -- the data, any object in everywhere except IE that supports only strings.

   We should use `addEventListener` to set the handler for this event inside the target window.

# The clickjacking attack

The &quot;clickjacking&quot; attack allows an evil page to click on a &quot;victim site&quot; _on behalf of the visitor_.

Many sites were hacked this way, including Twitter, Facebook, Paypal and other sites. They have all been fixed, of course.

## The idea

The idea is very simple.

Here&#39;s how clickjacking was done with Facebook:

1. A visitor is lured to the evil page. It doesn&#39;t matter how.
2. The page has a harmless-looking link on it (like &quot;get rich now&quot; or &quot;click here, very funny&quot;).
3. Over that link the evil page positions a transparent `&lt;iframe&gt;` with `src` from facebook.com, in such a way that the &quot;Like&quot; button is right above that link. Usually that&#39;s done with `z-index`.
4. In attempting to click the link, the visitor in fact clicks the button.

## The demo

Here&#39;s how the evil page looks. To make things clear, the `&lt;iframe&gt;` is half-transparent (in real evil pages it&#39;s fully transparent):

```html run height=120 no-beautify
&lt;style&gt;
  iframe { /* iframe from the victim site */
    width: 400px;
    height: 100px;
    position: absolute;
    top:0; left:-20px;
  *!*
    opacity: 0.5; /* in real opacity:0 */
  */!*
    z-index: 1;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Click to get rich now:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- The url from the victim site --&gt;
*!*
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/clickjacking/facebook.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;button&gt;Click here!&lt;/button&gt;
*/!*

&lt;div&gt;...And you&#39;re cool (I&#39;m a cool hacker actually)!&lt;/div&gt;
```

The full demo of the attack:

[codetabs src=&quot;clickjacking-visible&quot; height=160]

Here we have a half-transparent `&lt;iframe src=&quot;facebook.html&quot;&gt;`, and in the example we can see it hovering over the button. A click on the button actually clicks on the iframe, but that&#39;s not visible to the user, because the iframe is transparent.

As a result, if the visitor is authorized on Facebook (&quot;remember me&quot; is usually turned on), then it adds a &quot;Like&quot;. On Twitter that would be a &quot;Follow&quot; button.

Here&#39;s the same example, but closer to reality, with `opacity:0` for `&lt;iframe&gt;`:

[codetabs src=&quot;clickjacking&quot; height=160]

All we need to attack -- is to position the `&lt;iframe&gt;` on the evil page in such a way that the button is right over the link. So that when a user clicks the link, they actually click the button. That&#39;s usually doable with CSS.

```smart header=&quot;Clickjacking is for clicks, not for keyboard&quot;
The attack only affects mouse actions (or similar, like taps on mobile).

Keyboard input is much difficult to redirect. Technically, if we have a text field to hack, then we can position an iframe in such a way that text fields overlap each other. So when a visitor tries to focus on the input they see on the page, they actually focus on the input inside the iframe.

But then there&#39;s a problem. Everything that the visitor types will be hidden, because the iframe is not visible.

People will usually stop typing when they can&#39;t see their new characters printing on the screen.
```

## Old-school defences (weak)

The oldest defence is a bit of JavaScript which forbids opening the page in a frame (so-called &quot;framebusting&quot;).

That looks like this:

```js
if (top != window) {
  top.location = window.location;
}
```

That is: if the window finds out that it&#39;s not on top, then it automatically makes itself the top.

This not a reliable defence, because there are many ways to hack around it. Let&#39;s cover a few.

### Blocking top-navigation

We can block the transition caused by changing `top.location` in [beforeunload](info:onload-ondomcontentloaded#window.onbeforeunload) event handler.

The top page (enclosing one, belonging to the hacker) sets a preventing handler to it, like this:

```js
window.onbeforeunload = function () {
  return false;
};
```

When the `iframe` tries to change `top.location`, the visitor gets a message asking them whether they want to leave.

In most cases the visitor would answer negatively because they don&#39;t know about the iframe - all they can see is the top page, there&#39;s no reason to leave. So `top.location` won&#39;t change!

In action:

[codetabs src=&quot;top-location&quot;]

### Sandbox attribute

One of the things restricted by the `sandbox` attribute is navigation. A sandboxed iframe may not change `top.location`.

So we can add the iframe with `sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-forms&quot;`. That would relax the restrictions, permitting scripts and forms. But we omit `allow-top-navigation` so that changing `top.location` is forbidden.

Here&#39;s the code:

```html
&lt;iframe *!*sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-forms&quot;*/!* src=&quot;facebook.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
```

There are other ways to work around that simple protection too.

## X-Frame-Options

The server-side header `X-Frame-Options` can permit or forbid displaying the page inside a frame.

It must be sent exactly as HTTP-header: the browser will ignore it if found in HTML `&lt;meta&gt;` tag. So, `&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-Frame-Options&quot;...&gt;` won&#39;t do anything.

The header may have 3 values:

`DENY`
: Never ever show the page inside a frame.

`SAMEORIGIN`
: Allow inside a frame if the parent document comes from the same origin.

`ALLOW-FROM domain`
: Allow inside a frame if the parent document is from the given domain.

For instance, Twitter uses `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`.

````online
Here&#39;s the result:

```html
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
```

&lt;!-- ebook: prerender/ chrome headless dies and timeouts on this iframe --&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Depending on your browser, the `iframe` above is either empty or alerting you that the browser won&#39;t permit that page to be navigating in this way.
````

## Showing with disabled functionality

The `X-Frame-Options` header has a side-effect. Other sites won&#39;t be able to show our page in a frame, even if they have good reasons to do so.

So there are other solutions... For instance, we can &quot;cover&quot; the page with a `&lt;div&gt;` with styles `height: 100%; width: 100%;`, so that it will intercept all clicks. That `&lt;div&gt;` is to be removed if `window == top` or if we figure out that we don&#39;t need the protection.

Something like this:

```html
&lt;style&gt;
  #protector {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    z-index: 99999999;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;protector&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go to the site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  // there will be an error if top window is from the different origin
  // but that&#39;s ok here
  if (top.document.domain == document.domain) {
    protector.remove();
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The demo:

[codetabs src=&quot;protector&quot;]

## Samesite cookie attribute

The `samesite` cookie attribute can also prevent clickjacking attacks.

A cookie with such attribute is only sent to a website if it&#39;s opened directly, not via a frame, or otherwise. More information in the chapter &lt;info:cookie#samesite&gt;.

If the site, such as Facebook, had `samesite` attribute on its authentication cookie, like this:

```
Set-Cookie: authorization=secret; samesite
```

...Then such cookie wouldn&#39;t be sent when Facebook is open in iframe from another site. So the attack would fail.

The `samesite` cookie attribute will not have an effect when cookies are not used. This may allow other websites to easily show our public, unauthenticated pages in iframes.

However, this may also allow clickjacking attacks to work in a few limited cases. An anonymous polling website that prevents duplicate voting by checking IP addresses, for example, would still be vulnerable to clickjacking because it does not authenticate users using cookies.

## Summary

Clickjacking is a way to &quot;trick&quot; users into clicking on a victim site without even knowing what&#39;s happening. That&#39;s dangerous if there are important click-activated actions.

A hacker can post a link to their evil page in a message, or lure visitors to their page by some other means. There are many variations.

From one perspective -- the attack is &quot;not deep&quot;: all a hacker is doing is intercepting a single click. But from another perspective, if the hacker knows that after the click another control will appear, then they may use cunning messages to coerce the user into clicking on them as well.

The attack is quite dangerous, because when we engineer the UI we usually don&#39;t anticipate that a hacker may click on behalf of the visitor. So vulnerabilities can be found in totally unexpected places.

- It is recommended to use `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` on pages (or whole websites) which are not intended to be viewed inside frames.
- Use a covering `&lt;div&gt;` if we want to allow our pages to be shown in iframes, but still stay safe.

# ArrayBuffer, binary arrays

In web-development we meet binary data mostly while dealing with files (create, upload, download). Another typical use case is image processing.

That&#39;s all possible in JavaScript, and binary operations are high-performant.

Although, there&#39;s a bit of confusion, because there are many classes. To name a few:

- `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, `DataView`, `Blob`, `File`, etc.

Binary data in JavaScript is implemented in a non-standard way, compared to other languages. But when we sort things out, everything becomes fairly simple.

**The basic binary object is `ArrayBuffer` -- a reference to a fixed-length contiguous memory area.**

We create it like this:

```js run
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
```

This allocates a contiguous memory area of 16 bytes and pre-fills it with zeroes.

```warn header=&quot;`ArrayBuffer`is not an array of something&quot; Let&#39;s eliminate a possible source of confusion.`ArrayBuffer`has nothing in common with`Array`:

- It has a fixed length, we can&#39;t increase or decrease it.
- It takes exactly that much space in the memory.
- To access individual bytes, another &quot;view&quot; object is needed, not `buffer[index]`.

````

`ArrayBuffer` is a memory area. What&#39;s stored in it? It has no clue. Just a raw sequence of bytes.

**To manipulate an `ArrayBuffer`, we need to use a &quot;view&quot; object.**

A view object does not store anything on it&#39;s own. It&#39;s the &quot;eyeglasses&quot; that give an interpretation of the bytes stored in the `ArrayBuffer`.

For instance:

- **`Uint8Array`** -- treats each byte in `ArrayBuffer` as a separate number, with possible values from 0 to 255 (a byte is 8-bit, so it can hold only that much). Such value is called a &quot;8-bit unsigned integer&quot;.
- **`Uint16Array`** -- treats every 2 bytes as an integer, with possible values from 0 to 65535. That&#39;s called a &quot;16-bit unsigned integer&quot;.
- **`Uint32Array`** -- treats every 4 bytes as an integer, with possible values from 0 to 4294967295. That&#39;s called a &quot;32-bit unsigned integer&quot;.
- **`Float64Array`** -- treats every 8 bytes as a floating point number with possible values from &lt;code&gt;5.0x10&lt;sup&gt;-324&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;1.8x10&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

So, the binary data in an `ArrayBuffer` of 16 bytes can be interpreted as 16 &quot;tiny numbers&quot;, or 8 bigger numbers (2 bytes each), or 4 even bigger (4 bytes each), or 2 floating-point values with high precision (8 bytes each).

![](arraybuffer-views.svg)

`ArrayBuffer` is the core object, the root of everything, the raw binary data.

But if we&#39;re going to write into it, or iterate over it, basically for almost any operation – we must use a view, e.g:

```js run
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16

*!*
let view = new Uint32Array(buffer); // treat buffer as a sequence of 32-bit integers

alert(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); // 4 bytes per integer
*/!*

alert(view.length); // 4, it stores that many integers
alert(view.byteLength); // 16, the size in bytes

// let&#39;s write a value
view[0] = 123456;

// iterate over values
for(let num of view) {
  alert(num); // 123456, then 0, 0, 0 (4 values total)
}

````

## TypedArray

The common term for all these views (`Uint8Array`, `Uint32Array`, etc) is [TypedArray](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-typedarray-objects). They share the same set of methods and properities.

Please note, there&#39;s no constructor called `TypedArray`, it&#39;s just a common &quot;umbrella&quot; term to represent one of views over `ArrayBuffer`: `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array` and so on, the full list will soon follow.

When you see something like `new TypedArray`, it means any of `new Int8Array`, `new Uint8Array`, etc.

Typed arrays behave like regular arrays: have indexes and are iterable.

A typed array constructor (be it `Int8Array` or `Float64Array`, doesn&#39;t matter) behaves differently depending on argument types.

There are 5 variants of arguments:

```js
new TypedArray(buffer, [byteOffset], [length]);
new TypedArray(object);
new TypedArray(typedArray);
new TypedArray(length);
new TypedArray();
```

1. If an `ArrayBuffer` argument is supplied, the view is created over it. We used that syntax already.

   Optionally we can provide `byteOffset` to start from (0 by default) and the `length` (till the end of the buffer by default), then the view will cover only a part of the `buffer`.

2. If an `Array`, or any array-like object is given, it creates a typed array of the same length and copies the content.

   We can use it to pre-fill the array with the data:

   ```js run
   *!*
   let arr = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3]);
   */!*
   alert( arr.length ); // 4, created binary array of the same length
   alert( arr[1] ); // 1, filled with 4 bytes (unsigned 8-bit integers) with given values
   ```

3. If another `TypedArray` is supplied, it does the same: creates a typed array of the same length and copies values. Values are converted to the new type in the process, if needed.

   ```js run
   let arr16 = new Uint16Array([1, 1000]);
   *!*
   let arr8 = new Uint8Array(arr16);
   */!*
   alert( arr8[0] ); // 1
   alert( arr8[1] ); // 232, tried to copy 1000, but can&#39;t fit 1000 into 8 bits (explanations below)
   ```

4. For a numeric argument `length` -- creates the typed array to contain that many elements. Its byte length will be `length` multiplied by the number of bytes in a single item `TypedArray.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`:

   ```js run
   let arr = new Uint16Array(4); // create typed array for 4 integers
   alert(Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); // 2 bytes per integer
   alert(arr.byteLength); // 8 (size in bytes)
   ```

5. Without arguments, creates an zero-length typed array.

We can create a `TypedArray` directly, without mentioning `ArrayBuffer`. But a view cannot exist without an underlying `ArrayBuffer`, so gets created automatically in all these cases except the first one (when provided).

To access the `ArrayBuffer`, there are properties:

- `arr.buffer` -- references the `ArrayBuffer`.
- `arr.byteLength` -- the length of the `ArrayBuffer`.

So, we can always move from one view to another:

```js
let arr8 = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3]);

// another view on the same data
let arr16 = new Uint16Array(arr8.buffer);
```

Here&#39;s the list of typed arrays:

- `Uint8Array`, `Uint16Array`, `Uint32Array` -- for integer numbers of 8, 16 and 32 bits.
  - `Uint8ClampedArray` -- for 8-bit integers, &quot;clamps&quot; them on assignment (see below).
- `Int8Array`, `Int16Array`, `Int32Array` -- for signed integer numbers (can be negative).
- `Float32Array`, `Float64Array` -- for signed floating-point numbers of 32 and 64 bits.

```warn header=&quot;No `int8`or similar single-valued types&quot; Please note, despite of the names like`Int8Array`, there&#39;s no single-value type like `int`, or `int8` in JavaScript.

That&#39;s logical, as `Int8Array` is not an array of these individual values, but rather a view on `ArrayBuffer`.

````

### Out-of-bounds behavior

What if we attempt to write an out-of-bounds value into a typed array? There will be no error. But extra bits are cut-off.

For instance, let&#39;s try to put 256 into `Uint8Array`. In binary form, 256 is `100000000` (9 bits), but `Uint8Array` only provides 8 bits per value, that makes the available range from 0 to 255.

For bigger numbers, only the rightmost (less significant) 8 bits are stored, and the rest is cut off:

![](8bit-integer-256.svg)

So we&#39;ll get zero.

For 257, the binary form is `100000001` (9 bits), the rightmost 8 get stored, so we&#39;ll have `1` in the array:

![](8bit-integer-257.svg)

In other words, the number modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; is saved.

Here&#39;s the demo:

```js run
let uint8array = new Uint8Array(16);

let num = 256;
alert(num.toString(2)); // 100000000 (binary representation)

uint8array[0] = 256;
uint8array[1] = 257;

alert(uint8array[0]); // 0
alert(uint8array[1]); // 1
````

`Uint8ClampedArray` is special in this aspect, its behavior is different. It saves 255 for any number that is greater than 255, and 0 for any negative number. That behavior is useful for image processing.

## TypedArray methods

`TypedArray` has regular `Array` methods, with notable exceptions.

We can iterate, `map`, `slice`, `find`, `reduce` etc.

There are few things we can&#39;t do though:

- No `splice` -- we can&#39;t &quot;delete&quot; a value, because typed arrays are views on a buffer, and these are fixed, contiguous areas of memory. All we can do is to assign a zero.
- No `concat` method.

There are two additional methods:

- `arr.set(fromArr, [offset])` copies all elements from `fromArr` to the `arr`, starting at position `offset` (0 by default).
- `arr.subarray([begin, end])` creates a new view of the same type from `begin` to `end` (exclusive). That&#39;s similar to `slice` method (that&#39;s also supported), but doesn&#39;t copy anything -- just creates a new view, to operate on the given piece of data.

These methods allow us to copy typed arrays, mix them, create new arrays from existing ones, and so on.

## DataView

[DataView](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) is a special super-flexible &quot;untyped&quot; view over `ArrayBuffer`. It allows to access the data on any offset in any format.

- For typed arrays, the constructor dictates what the format is. The whole array is supposed to be uniform. The i-th number is `arr[i]`.
- With `DataView` we access the data with methods like `.getUint8(i)` or `.getUint16(i)`. We choose the format at method call time instead of the construction time.

The syntax:

```js
new DataView(buffer, [byteOffset], [byteLength]);
```

- **`buffer`** -- the underlying `ArrayBuffer`. Unlike typed arrays, `DataView` doesn&#39;t create a buffer on its own. We need to have it ready.
- **`byteOffset`** -- the starting byte position of the view (by default 0).
- **`byteLength`** -- the byte length of the view (by default till the end of `buffer`).

For instance, here we extract numbers in different formats from the same buffer:

```js run
// binary array of 4 bytes, all have the maximal value 255
let buffer = new Uint8Array([255, 255, 255, 255]).buffer;

let dataView = new DataView(buffer);

// get 8-bit number at offset 0
alert(dataView.getUint8(0)); // 255

// now get 16-bit number at offset 0, it consists of 2 bytes, together interpreted as 65535
alert(dataView.getUint16(0)); // 65535 (biggest 16-bit unsigned int)

// get 32-bit number at offset 0
alert(dataView.getUint32(0)); // 4294967295 (biggest 32-bit unsigned int)

dataView.setUint32(0, 0); // set 4-byte number to zero, thus setting all bytes to 0
```

`DataView` is great when we store mixed-format data in the same buffer. For example, when we store a sequence of pairs (16-bit integer, 32-bit float), `DataView` allows to access them easily.

## Summary

`ArrayBuffer` is the core object, a reference to the fixed-length contiguous memory area.

To do almost any operation on `ArrayBuffer`, we need a view.

- It can be a `TypedArray`:
  - `Uint8Array`, `Uint16Array`, `Uint32Array` -- for unsigned integers of 8, 16, and 32 bits.
  - `Uint8ClampedArray` -- for 8-bit integers, &quot;clamps&quot; them on assignment.
  - `Int8Array`, `Int16Array`, `Int32Array` -- for signed integer numbers (can be negative).
  - `Float32Array`, `Float64Array` -- for signed floating-point numbers of 32 and 64 bits.
- Or a `DataView` -- the view that uses methods to specify a format, e.g. `getUint8(offset)`.

In most cases we create and operate directly on typed arrays, leaving `ArrayBuffer` under cover, as a &quot;common denominator&quot;. We can access it as `.buffer` and make another view if needed.

There are also two additional terms, that are used in descriptions of methods that operate on binary data:

- `ArrayBufferView` is an umbrella term for all these kinds of views.
- `BufferSource` is an umbrella term for `ArrayBuffer` or `ArrayBufferView`.

We&#39;ll see these terms in the next chapters. `BufferSource` is one of the most common terms, as it means &quot;any kind of binary data&quot; -- an `ArrayBuffer` or a view over it.

Here&#39;s a cheatsheet:

![](arraybuffer-view-buffersource.svg)

# TextDecoder and TextEncoder

What if the binary data is actually a string? For instance, we received a file with textual data.

The build-in [TextDecoder](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-textdecoder) object allows to read the value into an actual JavaScript string, given the buffer and the encoding.

We first need to create it:

```js
let decoder = new TextDecoder([label], [options]);
```

- **`label`** -- the encoding, `utf-8` by default, but `big5`, `windows-1251` and many other are also supported.
- **`options`** -- optional object:
  - **`fatal`** -- boolean, if `true` then throw an exception for invalid (non-decodable) characters, otherwise (default) replace them with character `\uFFFD`.
  - **`ignoreBOM`** -- boolean, if `true` then ignore BOM (an optional byte-order Unicode mark), rarely needed.

...And then decode:

```js
let str = decoder.decode([input], [options]);
```

- **`input`** -- `BufferSource` to decode.
- **`options`** -- optional object:
  - **`stream`** -- true for decoding streams, when `decoder` is called repeatedly with incoming chunks of data. In that case a multi-byte character may occasionally split between chunks. This options tells `TextDecoder` to memorize &quot;unfinished&quot; characters and decode them when the next chunk comes.

For instance:

```js run
let uint8Array = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]);

alert(new TextDecoder().decode(uint8Array)); // Hello
```

```js run
let uint8Array = new Uint8Array([228, 189, 160, 229, 165, 189]);

alert(new TextDecoder().decode(uint8Array)); // 你好
```

We can decode a part of the buffer by creating a subarray view for it:

```js run
let uint8Array = new Uint8Array([0, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0]);

// the string is in the middle
// create a new view over it, without copying anything
let binaryString = uint8Array.subarray(1, -1);

alert(new TextDecoder().decode(binaryString)); // Hello
```

## TextEncoder

[TextEncoder](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-textencoder) does the reverse thing -- converts a string into bytes.

The syntax is:

```js
let encoder = new TextEncoder();
```

The only encoding it supports is &quot;utf-8&quot;.

It has two methods:

- **`encode(str)`** -- returns `Uint8Array` from a string.
- **`encodeInto(str, destination)`** -- encodes `str` into `destination` that must be `Uint8Array`.

```js run
let encoder = new TextEncoder();

let uint8Array = encoder.encode(&quot;Hello&quot;);
alert(uint8Array); // 72,101,108,108,111
```

# Comparisons

We know many comparison operators from maths.

In JavaScript they are written like this:

- Greater/less than: &lt;code&gt;a &amp;gt; b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/code&gt;.
- Greater/less than or equals: &lt;code&gt;a &amp;gt;= b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt;= b&lt;/code&gt;.
- Equals: `a == b`, please note the double equality sign `==` means the equality test, while a single one `a = b` means an assignment.
- Not equals. In maths the notation is &lt;code&gt;&amp;ne;&lt;/code&gt;, but in JavaScript it&#39;s written as &lt;code&gt;a != b&lt;/code&gt;.

In this article we&#39;ll learn more about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them, including important peculiarities.

At the end you&#39;ll find a good recipe to avoid &quot;JavaScript quirks&quot;-related issues.

## Boolean is the result

All comparison operators return a boolean value:

- `true` -- means &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;the truth&quot;.
- `false` -- means &quot;no&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;not the truth&quot;.

For example:

```js run
alert(2 &gt; 1); // true (correct)
alert(2 == 1); // false (wrong)
alert(2 != 1); // true (correct)
```

A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:

```js run
let result = 5 &gt; 4; // assign the result of the comparison
alert(result); // true
```

## String comparison

To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called &quot;dictionary&quot; or &quot;lexicographical&quot; order.

In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.

For example:

```js run
alert(&quot;Z&quot; &gt; &quot;A&quot;); // true
alert(&quot;Glow&quot; &gt; &quot;Glee&quot;); // true
alert(&quot;Bee&quot; &gt; &quot;Be&quot;); // true
```

The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:

1. Compare the first character of both strings.
2. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string&#39;s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We&#39;re done.
3. Otherwise, if both strings&#39; first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
4. Repeat until the end of either string.
5. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.

In the first example above, the comparison `&#39;Z&#39; &gt; &#39;A&#39;` gets to a result at the first step.

The second comparison `&#39;Glow&#39;` and `&#39;Glee&#39;` needs more steps as strings are compared character-by-character:

1. `G` is the same as `G`.
2. `l` is the same as `l`.
3. `o` is greater than `e`. Stop here. The first string is greater.

```smart header=&quot;Not a real dictionary, but Unicode order&quot;
The comparison algorithm given above is roughly equivalent to the one used in dictionaries or phone books, but it&#39;s not exactly the same.

For instance, case matters. A capital letter `&quot;A&quot;` is not equal to the lowercase `&quot;a&quot;`. Which one is greater? The lowercase `&quot;a&quot;`. Why? Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding table JavaScript uses (Unicode). We&#39;ll get back to specific details and consequences of this in the chapter &lt;info:string&gt;.
```

## Comparison of different types

When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.

For example:

```js run
alert(&quot;2&quot; &gt; 1); // true, string &#39;2&#39; becomes a number 2
alert(&quot;01&quot; == 1); // true, string &#39;01&#39; becomes a number 1
```

For boolean values, `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`.

For example:

```js run
alert(true == 1); // true
alert(false == 0); // true
```

````smart header=&quot;A funny consequence&quot;
It is possible that at the same time:

- Two values are equal.
- One of them is `true` as a boolean and the other one is `false` as a boolean.

For example:

```js run
let a = 0;
alert( Boolean(a) ); // false

let b = &quot;0&quot;;
alert( Boolean(b) ); // true

alert(a == b); // true!
```

From JavaScript&#39;s standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using the numeric conversion (hence `&quot;0&quot;` becomes `0`), while the explicit `Boolean` conversion uses another set of rules.
````

## Strict equality

A regular equality check `==` has a problem. It cannot differentiate `0` from `false`:

```js run
alert(0 == false); // true
```

The same thing happens with an empty string:

```js run
alert(&quot;&quot; == false); // true
```

This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator `==`. An empty string, just like `false`, becomes a zero.

What to do if we&#39;d like to differentiate `0` from `false`?

**A strict equality operator `===` checks the equality without type conversion.**

In other words, if `a` and `b` are of different types, then `a === b` immediately returns `false` without an attempt to convert them.

Let&#39;s try it:

```js run
alert(0 === false); // false, because the types are different
```

There is also a &quot;strict non-equality&quot; operator `!==` analogous to `!=`.

The strict equality operator is a bit longer to write, but makes it obvious what&#39;s going on and leaves less room for errors.

## Comparison with null and undefined

There&#39;s a non-intuitive behavior when `null` or `undefined` are compared to other values.

For a strict equality check `===`
: These values are different, because each of them is a different type.

    ```js run
    alert( null === undefined ); // false
    ```

For a non-strict check `==`
: There&#39;s a special rule. These two are a &quot;sweet couple&quot;: they equal each other (in the sense of `==`), but not any other value.

    ```js run
    alert( null == undefined ); // true
    ```

For maths and other comparisons `&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=`
: `null/undefined` are converted to numbers: `null` becomes `0`, while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.

Now let&#39;s see some funny things that happen when we apply these rules. And, what&#39;s more important, how to not fall into a trap with them.

### Strange result: null vs 0

Let&#39;s compare `null` with a zero:

```js run
alert(null &gt; 0); // (1) false
alert(null == 0); // (2) false
alert(null &gt;= 0); // (3) *!*true*/!*
```

Mathematically, that&#39;s strange. The last result states that &quot;`null` is greater than or equal to zero&quot;, so in one of the comparisons above it must be `true`, but they are both false.

The reason is that an equality check `==` and comparisons `&gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=` work differently. Comparisons convert `null` to a number, treating it as `0`. That&#39;s why (3) `null &gt;= 0` is true and (1) `null &gt; 0` is false.

On the other hand, the equality check `==` for `undefined` and `null` is defined such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and don&#39;t equal anything else. That&#39;s why (2) `null == 0` is false.

### An incomparable undefined

The value `undefined` shouldn&#39;t be compared to other values:

```js run
alert(undefined &gt; 0); // false (1)
alert(undefined &lt; 0); // false (2)
alert(undefined == 0); // false (3)
```

Why does it dislike zero so much? Always false!

We get these results because:

- Comparisons `(1)` and `(2)` return `false` because `undefined` gets converted to `NaN` and `NaN` is a special numeric value which returns `false` for all comparisons.
- The equality check `(3)` returns `false` because `undefined` only equals `null`, `undefined`, and no other value.

### Avoid problems

Why did we go over these examples? Should we remember these peculiarities all the time? Well, not really. Actually, these tricky things will gradually become familiar over time, but there&#39;s a solid way to avoid problems with them:

- Treat any comparison with `undefined/null` except the strict equality `===` with exceptional care.
- Don&#39;t use comparisons `&gt;= &gt; &lt; &lt;=` with a variable which may be `null/undefined`, unless you&#39;re really sure of what you&#39;re doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately.

## Summary

- Comparison operators return a boolean value.
- Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the &quot;dictionary&quot; order.
- When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers (with the exclusion of a strict equality check).
- The values `null` and `undefined` equal `==` each other and do not equal any other value.
- Be careful when using comparisons like `&gt;` or `&lt;` with variables that can occasionally be `null/undefined`. Checking for `null/undefined` separately is a good idea.

# Blob

`ArrayBuffer` and views are a part of ECMA standard, a part of JavaScript.

In the browser, there are additional higher-level objects, described in [File API](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/), in particular `Blob`.

`Blob` consists of an optional string `type` (a MIME-type usually), plus `blobParts` -- a sequence of other `Blob` objects, strings and `BufferSource`.

![](blob.svg)

The constructor syntax is:

```js
new Blob(blobParts, options);
```

- **`blobParts`** is an array of `Blob`/`BufferSource`/`String` values.
- **`options`** optional object:
  - **`type`** -- `Blob` type, usually MIME-type, e.g. `image/png`,
  - **`endings`** -- whether to transform end-of-line to make the `Blob` correspond to current OS newlines (`\r\n` or `\n`). By default `&quot;transparent&quot;` (do nothing), but also can be `&quot;native&quot;` (transform).

For example:

```js
// create Blob from a string
let blob = new Blob([&quot;&lt;html&gt;…&lt;/html&gt;&quot;], { type: &quot;text/html&quot; });
// please note: the first argument must be an array [...]
```

```js
// create Blob from a typed array and strings
let hello = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]); // &quot;Hello&quot; in binary form

let blob = new Blob([hello, &quot; &quot;, &quot;world&quot;], { type: &quot;text/plain&quot; });
```

We can extract `Blob` slices with:

```js
blob.slice([byteStart], [byteEnd], [contentType]);
```

- **`byteStart`** -- the starting byte, by default 0.
- **`byteEnd`** -- the last byte (exclusive, by default till the end).
- **`contentType`** -- the `type` of the new blob, by default the same as the source.

The arguments are similar to `array.slice`, negative numbers are allowed too.

```smart header=&quot;`Blob`objects are immutable&quot; We can&#39;t change data directly in a`Blob`, but we can slice parts of a `Blob`, create new `Blob`objects from them, mix them into a new`Blob` and so on.

This behavior is similar to JavaScript strings: we can&#39;t change a character in a string, but we can make a new corrected string.

````

## Blob as URL

A Blob can be easily used as a URL for `&lt;a&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;` or other tags, to show its contents.

Thanks to `type`, we can also download/upload `Blob` objects, and the `type` naturally becomes `Content-Type` in network requests.

Let&#39;s start with a simple example. By clicking on a link you download a dynamically-generated `Blob` with `hello world` contents as a file:

```html run
&lt;!-- download attribute forces the browser to download instead of navigating --&gt;
&lt;a download=&quot;hello.txt&quot; href=&#39;#&#39; id=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
let blob = new Blob([&quot;Hello, world!&quot;], {type: &#39;text/plain&#39;});

link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
&lt;/script&gt;
````

We can also create a link dynamically in JavaScript and simulate a click by `link.click()`, then download starts automatically.

Here&#39;s the similar code that causes user to download the dynamically created `Blob`, without any HTML:

```js run
let link = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);
link.download = &quot;hello.txt&quot;;

let blob = new Blob([&quot;Hello, world!&quot;], { type: &quot;text/plain&quot; });

link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

link.click();

URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);
```

`URL.createObjectURL` takes a `Blob` and creates a unique URL for it, in the form `blob:&lt;origin&gt;/&lt;uuid&gt;`.

That&#39;s what the value of `link.href` looks like:

```
blob:https://javascript.info/1e67e00e-860d-40a5-89ae-6ab0cbee6273
```

For each URL generated by `URL.createObjectURL` the browser stores a URL -&gt; `Blob` mapping internally. So such URLs are short, but allow to access the `Blob`.

A generated URL (and hence the link with it) is only valid within the current document, while it&#39;s open. And it allows to reference the `Blob` in `&lt;img&gt;`, `&lt;a&gt;`, basically any other object that expects a URL.

There&#39;s a side-effect though. While there&#39;s a mapping for a `Blob`, the `Blob` itself resides in the memory. The browser can&#39;t free it.

The mapping is automatically cleared on document unload, so `Blob` objects are freed then. But if an app is long-living, then that doesn&#39;t happen soon.

**So if we create a URL, that `Blob` will hang in memory, even if not needed any more.**

`URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` removes the reference from the internal mapping, thus allowing the `Blob` to be deleted (if there are no other references), and the memory to be freed.

In the last example, we intend the `Blob` to be used only once, for instant downloading, so we call `URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href)` immediately.

In the previous example with the clickable HTML-link, we don&#39;t call `URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href)`, because that would make the `Blob` url invalid. After the revocation, as the mapping is removed, the URL doesn&#39;t work any more.

## Blob to base64

An alternative to `URL.createObjectURL` is to convert a `Blob` into a base64-encoded string.

That encoding represents binary data as a string of ultra-safe &quot;readable&quot; characters with ASCII-codes from 0 to 64. And what&#39;s more important -- we can use this encoding in &quot;data-urls&quot;.

A [data url](mdn:/http/Data_URIs) has the form `data:[&lt;mediatype&gt;][;base64],&lt;data&gt;`. We can use such urls everywhere, on par with &quot;regular&quot; urls.

For instance, here&#39;s a smiley:

```html
&lt;img
  src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMAKIFAF5LAP/zxAAAANyuAP/gaP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAUALAAAAAAMAAwAAAMlWLPcGjDKFYi9lxKBOaGcF35DhWHamZUW0K4mAbiwWtuf0uxFAgA7&quot;
/&gt;
```

The browser will decode the string and show the image: &lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMAKIFAF5LAP/zxAAAANyuAP/gaP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAUALAAAAAAMAAwAAAMlWLPcGjDKFYi9lxKBOaGcF35DhWHamZUW0K4mAbiwWtuf0uxFAgA7&quot;&gt;

To transform a `Blob` into base64, we&#39;ll use the built-in `FileReader` object. It can read data from Blobs in multiple formats. In the [next chapter](info:file) we&#39;ll cover it more in-depth.

Here&#39;s the demo of downloading a blob, now via base-64:

```js run
let link = document.createElement(&#39;a&#39;);
link.download = &#39;hello.txt&#39;;

let blob = new Blob([&#39;Hello, world!&#39;], {type: &#39;text/plain&#39;});

*!*
let reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsDataURL(blob); // converts the blob to base64 and calls onload
*/!*

reader.onload = function() {
  link.href = reader.result; // data url
  link.click();
};
```

Both ways of making a URL of a `Blob` are usable. But usually `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` is simpler and faster.

```compare title-plus=&quot;URL.createObjectURL(blob)&quot; title-minus=&quot;Blob to data url&quot;
+ We need to revoke them if care about memory.
+ Direct access to blob, no &quot;encoding/decoding&quot;
- No need to revoke anything.
- Performance and memory losses on big `Blob` objects for encoding.
```

## Image to blob

We can create a `Blob` of an image, an image part, or even make a page screenshot. That&#39;s handy to upload it somewhere.

Image operations are done via `&lt;canvas&gt;` element:

1. Draw an image (or its part) on canvas using [canvas.drawImage](mdn:/api/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage).
2. Call canvas method [.toBlob(callback, format, quality)](mdn:/api/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob) that creates a `Blob` and runs `callback` with it when done.

In the example below, an image is just copied, but we could cut from it, or transform it on canvas prior to making a blob:

```js run
// take any image
let img = document.querySelector(&quot;img&quot;);

// make &lt;canvas&gt; of the same size
let canvas = document.createElement(&quot;canvas&quot;);
canvas.width = img.clientWidth;
canvas.height = img.clientHeight;

let context = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);

// copy image to it (this method allows to cut image)
context.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
// we can context.rotate(), and do many other things on canvas

// toBlob is async operation, callback is called when done
canvas.toBlob(function (blob) {
  // blob ready, download it
  let link = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);
  link.download = &quot;example.png&quot;;

  link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  link.click();

  // delete the internal blob reference, to let the browser clear memory from it
  URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);
}, &quot;image/png&quot;);
```

If we prefer `async/await` instead of callbacks:

```js
let blob = await new Promise((resolve) =&gt;
  canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, &quot;image/png&quot;)
);
```

For screenshotting a page, we can use a library such as &lt;https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas&gt;. What it does is just walks the page and draws it on `&lt;canvas&gt;`. Then we can get a `Blob` of it the same way as above.

## From Blob to ArrayBuffer

The `Blob` constructor allows to create a blob from almost anything, including any `BufferSource`.

But if we need to perform low-level processing, we can get the lowest-level `ArrayBuffer` from it using `FileReader`:

```js
// get arrayBuffer from blob
let fileReader = new FileReader();

*!*
fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);
*/!*

fileReader.onload = function(event) {
  let arrayBuffer = fileReader.result;
};
```

## Summary

While `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array` and other `BufferSource` are &quot;binary data&quot;, a [Blob](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob) represents &quot;binary data with type&quot;.

That makes Blobs convenient for upload/download operations, that are so common in the browser.

Methods that perform web-requests, such as [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest), [fetch](info:fetch) and so on, can work with `Blob` natively, as well as with other binary types.

We can easily convert between `Blob` and low-level binary data types:

- We can make a Blob from a typed array using `new Blob(...)` constructor.
- We can get back `ArrayBuffer` from a Blob using `FileReader`, and then create a view over it for low-level binary processing.

# File and FileReader

A [File](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-file) object inherits from `Blob` and is extended with filesystem-related capabilities.

There are two ways to obtain it.

First, there&#39;s a constructor, similar to `Blob`:

```js
new File(fileParts, fileName, [options]);
```

- **`fileParts`** -- is an array of Blob/BufferSource/String values.
- **`fileName`** -- file name string.
- **`options`** -- optional object:
  - **`lastModified`** -- the timestamp (integer date) of last modification.

Second, more often we get a file from `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;` or drag&#39;n&#39;drop or other browser interfaces. In that case, the file gets this information from OS.

As `File` inherits from `Blob`, `File` objects have the same properties, plus:

- `name` -- the file name,
- `lastModified` -- the timestamp of last modification.

That&#39;s how we can get a `File` object from `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;`:

```html run
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; onchange=&quot;showFile(this)&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function showFile(input) {
    let file = input.files[0];

    alert(`File name: ${file.name}`); // e.g my.png
    alert(`Last modified: ${file.lastModified}`); // e.g 1552830408824
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```smart
The input may select multiple files, so `input.files` is an array-like object with them. Here we have only one file, so we just take `input.files[0]`.
```

## FileReader

[FileReader](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-filereader) is an object with the sole purpose of reading data from `Blob` (and hence `File` too) objects.

It delivers the data using events, as reading from disk may take time.

The constructor:

```js
let reader = new FileReader(); // no arguments
```

The main methods:

- **`readAsArrayBuffer(blob)`** -- read the data in binary format `ArrayBuffer`.
- **`readAsText(blob, [encoding])`** -- read the data as a text string with the given encoding (`utf-8` by default).
- **`readAsDataURL(blob)`** -- read the binary data and encode it as base64 data url.
- **`abort()`** -- cancel the operation.

The choice of `read*` method depends on which format we prefer, how we&#39;re going to use the data.

- `readAsArrayBuffer` -- for binary files, to do low-level binary operations. For high-level operations, like slicing, `File` inherits from `Blob`, so we can call them directly, without reading.
- `readAsText` -- for text files, when we&#39;d like to get a string.
- `readAsDataURL` -- when we&#39;d like to use this data in `src` for `img` or another tag. There&#39;s an alternative to reading a file for that, as discussed in chapter &lt;info:blob&gt;: `URL.createObjectURL(file)`.

As the reading proceeds, there are events:

- `loadstart` -- loading started.
- `progress` -- occurs during reading.
- `load` -- no errors, reading complete.
- `abort` -- `abort()` called.
- `error` -- error has occurred.
- `loadend` -- reading finished with either success or failure.

When the reading is finished, we can access the result as:

- `reader.result` is the result (if successful)
- `reader.error` is the error (if failed).

The most widely used events are for sure `load` and `error`.

Here&#39;s an example of reading a file:

```html run
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; onchange=&quot;readFile(this)&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function readFile(input) {
    let file = input.files[0];

    let reader = new FileReader();

    reader.readAsText(file);

    reader.onload = function () {
      console.log(reader.result);
    };

    reader.onerror = function () {
      console.log(reader.error);
    };
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;`FileReader`for blobs&quot; As mentioned in the chapter &lt;info:blob&gt;,`FileReader` can read not just files, but any blobs.

We can use it to convert a blob to another format:

- `readAsArrayBuffer(blob)` -- to `ArrayBuffer`,
- `readAsText(blob, [encoding])` -- to string (an alternative to `TextDecoder`),
- `readAsDataURL(blob)` -- to base64 data url.

````


```smart header=&quot;`FileReaderSync` is available inside Web Workers&quot;
For Web Workers, there also exists a synchronous variant of `FileReader`, called [FileReaderSync](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#FileReaderSync).

Its reading methods `read*` do not generate events, but rather return a result, as regular functions do.

That&#39;s only inside a Web Worker though, because delays in synchronous calls, that are possible while reading from files, in Web Workers are less important. They do not affect the page.
````

## Summary

`File` objects inherit from `Blob`.

In addition to `Blob` methods and properties, `File` objects also have `name` and `lastModified` properties, plus the internal ability to read from filesystem. We usually get `File` objects from user input, like `&lt;input&gt;` or Drag&#39;n&#39;Drop events (`ondragend`).

`FileReader` objects can read from a file or a blob, in one of three formats:

- String (`readAsText`).
- `ArrayBuffer` (`readAsArrayBuffer`).
- Data url, base-64 encoded (`readAsDataURL`).

In many cases though, we don&#39;t have to read the file contents. Just as we did with blobs, we can create a short url with `URL.createObjectURL(file)` and assign it to `&lt;a&gt;` or `&lt;img&gt;`. This way the file can be downloaded or shown up as an image, as a part of canvas etc.

And if we&#39;re going to send a `File` over a network, that&#39;s also easy: network API like `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` natively accepts `File` objects.

# Fetch

JavaScript can send network requests to the server and load new information whenever it&#39;s needed.

For example, we can use a network request to:

- Submit an order,
- Load user information,
- Receive latest updates from the server,
- ...etc.

...And all of that without reloading the page!

There&#39;s an umbrella term &quot;AJAX&quot; (abbreviated &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;synchronous &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;avaScript &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;nd &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;ML) for network requests from JavaScript. We don&#39;t have to use XML though: the term comes from old times, that&#39;s why that word is there. You may have heard that term already.

There are multiple ways to send a network request and get information from the server.

The `fetch()` method is modern and versatile, so we&#39;ll start with it. It&#39;s not supported by old browsers (can be polyfilled), but very well supported among the modern ones.

The basic syntax is:

```js
let promise = fetch(url, [options]);
```

- **`url`** -- the URL to access.
- **`options`** -- optional parameters: method, headers etc.

Without `options`, this is a simple GET request, downloading the contents of the `url`.

The browser starts the request right away and returns a promise that the calling code should use to get the result.

Getting a response is usually a two-stage process.

**First, the `promise`, returned by `fetch`, resolves with an object of the built-in [Response](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class) class as soon as the server responds with headers.**

At this stage we can check HTTP status, to see whether it is successful or not, check headers, but don&#39;t have the body yet.

The promise rejects if the `fetch` was unable to make HTTP-request, e.g. network problems, or there&#39;s no such site. Abnormal HTTP-statuses, such as 404 or 500 do not cause an error.

We can see HTTP-status in response properties:

- **`status`** -- HTTP status code, e.g. 200.
- **`ok`** -- boolean, `true` if the HTTP status code is 200-299.

For example:

```js
let response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) {
  // if HTTP-status is 200-299
  // get the response body (the method explained below)
  let json = await response.json();
} else {
  alert(&quot;HTTP-Error: &quot; + response.status);
}
```

**Second, to get the response body, we need to use an additional method call.**

`Response` provides multiple promise-based methods to access the body in various formats:

- **`response.text()`** -- read the response and return as text,
- **`response.json()`** -- parse the response as JSON,
- **`response.formData()`** -- return the response as `FormData` object (explained in the [next chapter](info:formdata)),
- **`response.blob()`** -- return the response as [Blob](info:blob) (binary data with type),
- **`response.arrayBuffer()`** -- return the response as [ArrayBuffer](info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays) (low-level representation of binary data),
- additionally, `response.body` is a [ReadableStream](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-class) object, it allows you to read the body chunk-by-chunk, we&#39;ll see an example later.

For instance, let&#39;s get a JSON-object with latest commits from GitHub:

```js run async
let url = &#39;https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits&#39;;
let response = await fetch(url);

*!*
let commits = await response.json(); // read response body and parse as JSON
*/!*

alert(commits[0].author.login);
```

Or, the same without `await`, using pure promises syntax:

```js run
fetch(
  &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits&quot;
)
  .then((response) =&gt; response.json())
  .then((commits) =&gt; alert(commits[0].author.login));
```

To get the response text, `await response.text()` instead of `.json()`:

```js run async
let response = await fetch(
  &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits&quot;
);

let text = await response.text(); // read response body as text

alert(text.slice(0, 80) + &quot;...&quot;);
```

As a show-case for reading in binary format, let&#39;s fetch and show a logo image of [&quot;fetch&quot; specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) (see chapter [Blob](info:blob) for details about operations on `Blob`):

```js async run
let response = await fetch(&#39;/article/fetch/logo-fetch.svg&#39;);

*!*
let blob = await response.blob(); // download as Blob object
*/!*

// create &lt;img&gt; for it
let img = document.createElement(&#39;img&#39;);
img.style = &#39;position:fixed;top:10px;left:10px;width:100px&#39;;
document.body.append(img);

// show it
img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

setTimeout(() =&gt; { // hide after three seconds
  img.remove();
  URL.revokeObjectURL(img.src);
}, 3000);
```

````warn
We can choose only one body-reading method.

If we&#39;ve already got the response with `response.text()`, then `response.json()` won&#39;t work, as the body content has already been processed.

```js
let text = await response.text(); // response body consumed
let parsed = await response.json(); // fails (already consumed)
```
````

## Response headers

The response headers are available in a Map-like headers object in `response.headers`.

It&#39;s not exactly a Map, but it has similar methods to get individual headers by name or iterate over them:

```js run async
let response = await fetch(
  &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits&quot;
);

// get one header
alert(response.headers.get(&quot;Content-Type&quot;)); // application/json; charset=utf-8

// iterate over all headers
for (let [key, value] of response.headers) {
  alert(`${key} = ${value}`);
}
```

## Request headers

To set a request header in `fetch`, we can use the `headers` option. It has an object with outgoing headers, like this:

```js
let response = fetch(protectedUrl, {
  headers: {
    Authentication: &quot;secret&quot;,
  },
});
```

...But there&#39;s a list of [forbidden HTTP headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name) that we can&#39;t set:

- `Accept-Charset`, `Accept-Encoding`
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Request-Method`
- `Connection`
- `Content-Length`
- `Cookie`, `Cookie2`
- `Date`
- `DNT`
- `Expect`
- `Host`
- `Keep-Alive`
- `Origin`
- `Referer`
- `TE`
- `Trailer`
- `Transfer-Encoding`
- `Upgrade`
- `Via`
- `Proxy-*`
- `Sec-*`

These headers ensure proper and safe HTTP, so they are controlled exclusively by the browser.

## POST requests

To make a `POST` request, or a request with another method, we need to use `fetch` options:

- **`method`** -- HTTP-method, e.g. `POST`,
- **`body`** -- the request body, one of:
  - a string (e.g. JSON-encoded),
  - `FormData` object, to submit the data as `form/multipart`,
  - `Blob`/`BufferSource` to send binary data,
  - [URLSearchParams](info:url), to submit the data in `x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding, rarely used.

The JSON format is used most of the time.

For example, this code submits `user` object as JSON:

```js run async
let user = {
  name: &#39;John&#39;,
  surname: &#39;Smith&#39;
};

*!*
let response = await fetch(&#39;/article/fetch/post/user&#39;, {
  method: &#39;POST&#39;,
  headers: {
    &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json;charset=utf-8&#39;
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(user)
});
*/!*

let result = await response.json();
alert(result.message);
```

Please note, if the request `body` is a string, then `Content-Type` header is set to `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` by default.

But, as we&#39;re going to send JSON, we use `headers` option to send `application/json` instead, the correct `Content-Type` for JSON-encoded data.

## Sending an image

We can also submit binary data with `fetch` using `Blob` or `BufferSource` objects.

In this example, there&#39;s a `&lt;canvas&gt;` where we can draw by moving a mouse over it. A click on the &quot;submit&quot; button sends the image to the server:

```html run autorun height=&quot;90&quot;
&lt;body style=&quot;margin:0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;canvas
    id=&quot;canvasElem&quot;
    width=&quot;100&quot;
    height=&quot;80&quot;
    style=&quot;border:1px solid&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; onclick=&quot;submit()&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;
    canvasElem.onmousemove = function (e) {
      let ctx = canvasElem.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
      ctx.lineTo(e.clientX, e.clientY);
      ctx.stroke();
    };

    async function submit() {
      let blob = await new Promise((resolve) =&gt;
        canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, &quot;image/png&quot;)
      );
      let response = await fetch(&quot;/article/fetch/post/image&quot;, {
        method: &quot;POST&quot;,
        body: blob,
      });

      // the server responds with confirmation and the image size
      let result = await response.json();
      alert(result.message);
    }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

Please note, here we don&#39;t set `Content-Type` header manually, because a `Blob` object has a built-in type (here `image/png`, as generated by `toBlob`). For `Blob` objects that type becomes the value of `Content-Type`.

The `submit()` function can be rewritten without `async/await` like this:

```js
function submit() {
  canvasElem.toBlob(function (blob) {
    fetch(&quot;/article/fetch/post/image&quot;, {
      method: &quot;POST&quot;,
      body: blob,
    })
      .then((response) =&gt; response.json())
      .then((result) =&gt; alert(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)));
  }, &quot;image/png&quot;);
}
```

## Summary

A typical fetch request consists of two `await` calls:

```js
let response = await fetch(url, options); // resolves with response headers
let result = await response.json(); // read body as json
```

Or, without `await`:

```js
fetch(url, options)
  .then(response =&gt; response.json())
  .then(result =&gt; /* process result */)
```

Response properties:

- `response.status` -- HTTP code of the response,
- `response.ok` -- `true` is the status is 200-299.
- `response.headers` -- Map-like object with HTTP headers.

Methods to get response body:

- **`response.text()`** -- return the response as text,
- **`response.json()`** -- parse the response as JSON object,
- **`response.formData()`** -- return the response as `FormData` object (form/multipart encoding, see the next chapter),
- **`response.blob()`** -- return the response as [Blob](info:blob) (binary data with type),
- **`response.arrayBuffer()`** -- return the response as [ArrayBuffer](info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays) (low-level binary data),

Fetch options so far:

- `method` -- HTTP-method,
- `headers` -- an object with request headers (not any header is allowed),
- `body` -- the data to send (request body) as `string`, `FormData`, `BufferSource`, `Blob` or `UrlSearchParams` object.

In the next chapters we&#39;ll see more options and use cases of `fetch`.

# FormData

This chapter is about sending HTML forms: with or without files, with additional fields and so on.

[FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects can help with that. As you might have guessed, it&#39;s the object to represent HTML form data.

The constructor is:

```js
let formData = new FormData([form]);
```

If HTML `form` element is provided, it automatically captures its fields.

The special thing about `FormData` is that network methods, such as `fetch`, can accept a `FormData` object as a body. It&#39;s encoded and sent out with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.

From the server point of view, that looks like a usual form submission.

## Sending a simple form

Let&#39;s send a simple form first.

As you can see, that&#39;s almost one-liner:

```html run autorun
&lt;form id=&quot;formElem&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;John&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    formElem.onsubmit = async (e) =&gt; {
      e.preventDefault();

      let response = await fetch(&#39;/article/formdata/post/user&#39;, {
        method: &#39;POST&#39;,
  *!*
        body: new FormData(formElem)
  */!*
      });

      let result = await response.json();

      alert(result.message);
    };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

In this example, the server code is not presented, as it&#39;s beyond our scope. The server accepts the POST request and replies &quot;User saved&quot;.

## FormData Methods

We can modify fields in `FormData` with methods:

- `formData.append(name, value)` - add a form field with the given `name` and `value`,
- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)` - add a field as if it were `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;`, the third argument `fileName` sets file name (not form field name), as it were a name of the file in user&#39;s filesystem,
- `formData.delete(name)` - remove the field with the given `name`,
- `formData.get(name)` - get the value of the field with the given `name`,
- `formData.has(name)` - if there exists a field with the given `name`, returns `true`, otherwise `false`

A form is technically allowed to have many fields with the same `name`, so multiple calls to `append` add more same-named fields.

There&#39;s also method `set`, with the same syntax as `append`. The difference is that `.set` removes all fields with the given `name`, and then appends a new field. So it makes sure there&#39;s only one field with such `name`, the rest is just like `append`:

- `formData.set(name, value)`,
- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`.

Also we can iterate over formData fields using `for..of` loop:

```js run
let formData = new FormData();
formData.append(&quot;key1&quot;, &quot;value1&quot;);
formData.append(&quot;key2&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;);

// List key/value pairs
for (let [name, value] of formData) {
  alert(`${name} = ${value}`); // key1 = value1, then key2 = value2
}
```

## Sending a form with a file

The form is always sent as `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`, this encoding allows to send files. So, `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;` fields are sent also, similar to a usual form submission.

Here&#39;s an example with such form:

```html run autorun
&lt;form id=&quot;formElem&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstName&quot; value=&quot;John&quot; /&gt;
  Picture: &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;picture&quot; accept=&quot;image/*&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    formElem.onsubmit = async (e) =&gt; {
      e.preventDefault();

      let response = await fetch(&#39;/article/formdata/post/user-avatar&#39;, {
        method: &#39;POST&#39;,
  *!*
        body: new FormData(formElem)
  */!*
      });

      let result = await response.json();

      alert(result.message);
    };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Sending a form with Blob data

As we&#39;ve seen in the chapter &lt;info:fetch&gt;, it&#39;s easy to send dynamically generated binary data e.g. an image, as `Blob`. We can supply it directly as `fetch` parameter `body`.

In practice though, it&#39;s often convenient to send an image not separately, but as a part of the form, with additional fields, such as &quot;name&quot; and other metadata.

Also, servers are usually more suited to accept multipart-encoded forms, rather than raw binary data.

This example submits an image from `&lt;canvas&gt;`, along with some other fields, as a form, using `FormData`:

```html run autorun height=&quot;90&quot;
&lt;body style=&quot;margin:0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;canvas
    id=&quot;canvasElem&quot;
    width=&quot;100&quot;
    height=&quot;80&quot;
    style=&quot;border:1px solid&quot;
  &gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; onclick=&quot;submit()&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;
        canvasElem.onmousemove = function(e) {
          let ctx = canvasElem.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);
          ctx.lineTo(e.clientX, e.clientY);
          ctx.stroke();
        };

        async function submit() {
          let imageBlob = await new Promise(resolve =&gt; canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, &#39;image/png&#39;));

    *!*
          let formData = new FormData();
          formData.append(&quot;firstName&quot;, &quot;John&quot;);
          formData.append(&quot;image&quot;, imageBlob, &quot;image.png&quot;);
    */!*

          let response = await fetch(&#39;/article/formdata/post/image-form&#39;, {
            method: &#39;POST&#39;,
            body: formData
          });
          let result = await response.json();
          alert(result.message);
        }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

Please note how the image `Blob` is added:

```js
formData.append(&quot;image&quot;, imageBlob, &quot;image.png&quot;);
```

That&#39;s same as if there were `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;image&quot;&gt;` in the form, and the visitor submitted a file named `&quot;image.png&quot;` (3rd argument) with the data `imageBlob` (2nd argument) from their filesystem.

The server reads form data and the file, as if it were a regular form submission.

## Summary

[FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects are used to capture HTML form and submit it using `fetch` or another network method.

We can either create `new FormData(form)` from an HTML form, or create a object without a form at all, and then append fields with methods:

- `formData.append(name, value)`
- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)`
- `formData.set(name, value)`
- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`

Let&#39;s note two peculiarities here:

1. The `set` method removes fields with the same name, `append` doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s the only difference between them.
2. To send a file, 3-argument syntax is needed, the last argument is a file name, that normally is taken from user filesystem for `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;`.

Other methods are:

- `formData.delete(name)`
- `formData.get(name)`
- `formData.has(name)`

That&#39;s it!

# Fetch: Download progress

The `fetch` method allows to track _download_ progress.

Please note: there&#39;s currently no way for `fetch` to track _upload_ progress. For that purpose, please use [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest), we&#39;ll cover it later.

To track download progress, we can use `response.body` property. It&#39;s `ReadableStream` -- a special object that provides body chunk-by-chunk, as it comes. Readable streams are described in the [Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-class) specification.

Unlike `response.text()`, `response.json()` and other methods, `response.body` gives full control over the reading process, and we can count how much is consumed at any moment.

Here&#39;s the sketch of code that reads the response from `response.body`:

```js
// instead of response.json() and other methods
const reader = response.body.getReader();

// infinite loop while the body is downloading
while (true) {
  // done is true for the last chunk
  // value is Uint8Array of the chunk bytes
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();

  if (done) {
    break;
  }

  console.log(`Received ${value.length} bytes`);
}
```

The result of `await reader.read()` call is an object with two properties:

- **`done`** -- `true` when the reading is complete, otherwise `false`.
- **`value`** -- a typed array of bytes: `Uint8Array`.

```smart
Streams API also describes asynchronous iteration over `ReadableStream` with `for await..of` loop, but it&#39;s not yet widely supported (see [browser issues](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/778#issuecomment-461341033)), so we use `while` loop.
```

We receive response chunks in the loop, until the loading finishes, that is: until `done` becomes `true`.

To log the progress, we just need for every received fragment `value` to add its length to the counter.

Here&#39;s the full working example that gets the response and logs the progress in console, more explanations to follow:

```js run async
// Step 1: start the fetch and obtain a reader
let response = await fetch(
  &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits?per_page=100&quot;
);

const reader = response.body.getReader();

// Step 2: get total length
const contentLength = +response.headers.get(&quot;Content-Length&quot;);

// Step 3: read the data
let receivedLength = 0; // received that many bytes at the moment
let chunks = []; // array of received binary chunks (comprises the body)
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();

  if (done) {
    break;
  }

  chunks.push(value);
  receivedLength += value.length;

  console.log(`Received ${receivedLength} of ${contentLength}`);
}

// Step 4: concatenate chunks into single Uint8Array
let chunksAll = new Uint8Array(receivedLength); // (4.1)
let position = 0;
for (let chunk of chunks) {
  chunksAll.set(chunk, position); // (4.2)
  position += chunk.length;
}

// Step 5: decode into a string
let result = new TextDecoder(&quot;utf-8&quot;).decode(chunksAll);

// We&#39;re done!
let commits = JSON.parse(result);
alert(commits[0].author.login);
```

Let&#39;s explain that step-by-step:

1. We perform `fetch` as usual, but instead of calling `response.json()`, we obtain a stream reader `response.body.getReader()`.

   Please note, we can&#39;t use both these methods to read the same response: either use a reader or a response method to get the result.

2. Prior to reading, we can figure out the full response length from the `Content-Length` header.

   It may be absent for cross-origin requests (see chapter &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt;) and, well, technically a server doesn&#39;t have to set it. But usually it&#39;s at place.

3. Call `await reader.read()` until it&#39;s done.

   We gather response chunks in the array `chunks`. That&#39;s important, because after the response is consumed, we won&#39;t be able to &quot;re-read&quot; it using `response.json()` or another way (you can try, there&#39;ll be an error).

4. At the end, we have `chunks` -- an array of `Uint8Array` byte chunks. We need to join them into a single result. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no single method that concatenates those, so there&#39;s some code to do that:
   1. We create `chunksAll = new Uint8Array(receivedLength)` -- a same-typed array with the combined length.
   2. Then use `.set(chunk, position)` method to copy each `chunk` one after another in it.
5. We have the result in `chunksAll`. It&#39;s a byte array though, not a string.

   To create a string, we need to interpret these bytes. The built-in [TextDecoder](info:text-decoder) does exactly that. Then we can `JSON.parse` it, if necessary.

   What if we need binary content instead of a string? That&#39;s even simpler. Replace steps 4 and 5 with a single line that creates a `Blob` from all chunks:

   ```js
   let blob = new Blob(chunks);
   ```

At the end we have the result (as a string or a blob, whatever is convenient), and progress-tracking in the process.

Once again, please note, that&#39;s not for _upload_ progress (no way now with `fetch`), only for _download_ progress.

Also, if the size is unknown, we should check `receivedLength` in the loop and break it once it reaches a certain limit. So that the `chunks` won&#39;t overflow the memory.

# Fetch: Abort

As we know, `fetch` returns a promise. And JavaScript generally has no concept of &quot;aborting&quot; a promise. So how can we cancel an ongoing `fetch`? E.g. if the user actions on our site indicate that the `fetch` isn&#39;t needed any more.

There&#39;s a special built-in object for such purposes: `AbortController`. It can be used to abort not only `fetch`, but other asynchronous tasks as well.

The usage is very straightforward:

## The AbortController object

Create a controller:

```js
let controller = new AbortController();
```

A controller is an extremely simple object.

- It has a single method `abort()`,
- And a single property `signal` that allows to set event listeners on it.

When `abort()` is called:

- `controller.signal` emits the `&quot;abort&quot;` event.
- `controller.signal.aborted` property becomes `true`.

Generally, we have two parties in the process:

1. The one that performs a cancelable operation, it sets a listener on `controller.signal`.
2. The one that cancels: it calls `controller.abort()` when needed.

Here&#39;s the full example (without `fetch` yet):

```js run
let controller = new AbortController();
let signal = controller.signal;

// The party that performs a cancelable operation
// gets the &quot;signal&quot; object
// and sets the listener to trigger when controller.abort() is called
signal.addEventListener(&quot;abort&quot;, () =&gt; alert(&quot;abort!&quot;));

// The other party, that cancels (at any point later):
controller.abort(); // abort!

// The event triggers and signal.aborted becomes true
alert(signal.aborted); // true
```

As we can see, `AbortController` is just a mean to pass `abort` events when `abort()` is called on it.

We could implement the same kind of event listening in our code on our own, without the `AbortController` object.

But what&#39;s valuable is that `fetch` knows how to work with the `AbortController` object. It&#39;s integrated in it.

## Using with fetch

To be able to cancel `fetch`, pass the `signal` property of an `AbortController` as a `fetch` option:

```js
let controller = new AbortController();
fetch(url, {
  signal: controller.signal,
});
```

The `fetch` method knows how to work with `AbortController`. It will listen to `abort` events on `signal`.

Now, to abort, call `controller.abort()`:

```js
controller.abort();
```

We&#39;re done: `fetch` gets the event from `signal` and aborts the request.

When a fetch is aborted, its promise rejects with an error `AbortError`, so we should handle it, e.g. in `try..catch`.

Here&#39;s the full example with `fetch` aborted after 1 second:

```js run async
// abort in 1 second
let controller = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() =&gt; controller.abort(), 1000);

try {
  let response = await fetch(&quot;/article/fetch-abort/demo/hang&quot;, {
    signal: controller.signal,
  });
} catch (err) {
  if (err.name == &quot;AbortError&quot;) {
    // handle abort()
    alert(&quot;Aborted!&quot;);
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

## AbortController is scalable

`AbortController` is scalable. It allows to cancel multiple fetches at once.

Here&#39;s a sketch of code that fetches many `urls` in parallel, and uses a single controller to abort them all:

```js
let urls = [...]; // a list of urls to fetch in parallel

let controller = new AbortController();

// an array of fetch promises
let fetchJobs = urls.map(url =&gt; fetch(url, {
  signal: controller.signal
}));

let results = await Promise.all(fetchJobs);

// if controller.abort() is called from anywhere,
// it aborts all fetches
```

If we have our own asynchronous tasks, different from `fetch`, we can use a single `AbortController` to stop those, together with fetches.

We just need to listen to its `abort` event in our tasks:

```js
let urls = [...];
let controller = new AbortController();

let ourJob = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { // our task
  ...
  controller.signal.addEventListener(&#39;abort&#39;, reject);
});

let fetchJobs = urls.map(url =&gt; fetch(url, { // fetches
  signal: controller.signal
}));

// Wait for fetches and our task in parallel
let results = await Promise.all([...fetchJobs, ourJob]);

// if controller.abort() is called from anywhere,
// it aborts all fetches and ourJob
```

## Summary

- `AbortController` is a simple object that generates an `abort` event on it&#39;s `signal` property when the `abort()` method is called (and also sets `signal.aborted` to `true`).
- `fetch` integrates with it: we pass the `signal` property as the option, and then `fetch` listens to it, so it&#39;s possible to abort the `fetch`.
- We can use `AbortController` in our code. The &quot;call `abort()`&quot; -&gt; &quot;listen to `abort` event&quot; interaction is simple and universal. We can use it even without `fetch`.

# Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests

If we send a `fetch` request to another web-site, it will probably fail.

For instance, let&#39;s try fetching `http://example.com`:

```js run async
try {
  await fetch(&quot;http://example.com&quot;);
} catch (err) {
  alert(err); // Failed to fetch
}
```

Fetch fails, as expected.

The core concept here is _origin_ -- a domain/port/protocol triplet.

Cross-origin requests -- those sent to another domain (even a subdomain) or protocol or port -- require special headers from the remote side.

That policy is called &quot;CORS&quot;: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Why is CORS needed? A brief history

CORS exists to protect the internet from evil hackers.

Seriously. Let&#39;s make a very brief historical digression.

**For many years a script from one site could not access the content of another site.**

That simple, yet powerful rule was a foundation of the internet security. E.g. an evil script from website `hacker.com` could not access the user&#39;s mailbox at website `gmail.com`. People felt safe.

JavaScript also did not have any special methods to perform network requests at that time. It was a toy language to decorate a web page.

But web developers demanded more power. A variety of tricks were invented to work around the limitation and make requests to other websites.

### Using forms

One way to communicate with another server was to submit a `&lt;form&gt;` there. People submitted it into `&lt;iframe&gt;`, just to stay on the current page, like this:

```html
&lt;!-- form target --&gt;
*!*
&lt;iframe name=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
*/!*

&lt;!-- a form could be dynamically generated and submited by JavaScript --&gt;
*!*
&lt;form target=&quot;iframe&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;http://another.com/…&quot;&gt;
  */!* ...
&lt;/form&gt;
```

So, it was possible to make a GET/POST request to another site, even without networking methods, as forms can send data anywhere. But as it&#39;s forbidden to access the content of an `&lt;iframe&gt;` from another site, it wasn&#39;t possible to read the response.

To be precise, there were actually tricks for that, they required special scripts at both the iframe and the page. So the communication with the iframe was technically possible. Right now there&#39;s no point to go into details, let these dinosaurs rest in peace.

### Using scripts

Another trick was to use a `script` tag. A script could have any `src`, with any domain, like `&lt;script src=&quot;http://another.com/…&quot;&gt;`. It&#39;s possible to execute a script from any website.

If a website, e.g. `another.com` intended to expose data for this kind of access, then a so-called &quot;JSONP (JSON with padding)&quot; protocol was used.

Here&#39;s how it worked.

Let&#39;s say we, at our site, need to get the data from `http://another.com`, such as the weather:

1. First, in advance, we declare a global function to accept the data, e.g. `gotWeather`.

   ```js
   // 1. Declare the function to process the weather data
   function gotWeather({ temperature, humidity }) {
     alert(`temperature: ${temperature}, humidity: ${humidity}`);
   }
   ```

2. Then we make a `&lt;script&gt;` tag with `src=&quot;http://another.com/weather.json?callback=gotWeather&quot;`, using the name of our function as the `callback` URL-parameter.

   ```js
   let script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
   script.src = `http://another.com/weather.json?callback=gotWeather`;
   document.body.append(script);
   ```

3. The remote server `another.com` dynamically generates a script that calls `gotWeather(...)` with the data it wants us to receive.
   ```js
   // The expected answer from the server looks like this:
   gotWeather({
     temperature: 25,
     humidity: 78,
   });
   ```
4. When the remote script loads and executes, `gotWeather` runs, and, as it&#39;s our function, we have the data.

That works, and doesn&#39;t violate security, because both sides agreed to pass the data this way. And, when both sides agree, it&#39;s definitely not a hack. There are still services that provide such access, as it works even for very old browsers.

After a while, networking methods appeared in browser JavaScript.

At first, cross-origin requests were forbidden. But as a result of long discussions, cross-origin requests were allowed, but with any new capabilities requiring an explicit allowance by the server, expressed in special headers.

## Safe requests

There are two types of cross-origin requests:

1. Safe requests.
2. All the others.

Safe Requests are simpler to make, so let&#39;s start with them.

A request is safe if it satisfies two conditions:

1. [Safe method](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method): GET, POST or HEAD
2. [Safe headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header) -- the only allowed custom headers are:
   - `Accept`,
   - `Accept-Language`,
   - `Content-Language`,
   - `Content-Type` with the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.

Any other request is considered &quot;unsafe&quot;. For instance, a request with `PUT` method or with an `API-Key` HTTP-header does not fit the limitations.

**The essential difference is that a safe request can be made with a `&lt;form&gt;` or a `&lt;script&gt;`, without any special methods.**

So, even a very old server should be ready to accept a safe request.

Contrary to that, requests with non-standard headers or e.g. method `DELETE` can&#39;t be created this way. For a long time JavaScript was unable to do such requests. So an old server may assume that such requests come from a privileged source, &quot;because a webpage is unable to send them&quot;.

When we try to make a unsafe request, the browser sends a special &quot;preflight&quot; request that asks the server -- does it agree to accept such cross-origin requests, or not?

And, unless the server explicitly confirms that with headers, an unsafe request is not sent.

Now we&#39;ll go into details.

## CORS for safe requests

If a request is cross-origin, the browser always adds the `Origin` header to it.

For instance, if we request `https://anywhere.com/request` from `https://javascript.info/page`, the headers will look like:

```http
GET /request
Host: anywhere.com
*!*
Origin: https://javascript.info
*/!*
...
```

As you can see, the `Origin` header contains exactly the origin (domain/protocol/port), without a path.

The server can inspect the `Origin` and, if it agrees to accept such a request, add a special header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the response. That header should contain the allowed origin (in our case `https://javascript.info`), or a star `*`. Then the response is successful, otherwise it&#39;s an error.

The browser plays the role of a trusted mediator here:

1. It ensures that the correct `Origin` is sent with a cross-origin request.
2. It checks for permitting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response, if it exists, then JavaScript is allowed to access the response, otherwise it fails with an error.

![](xhr-another-domain.svg)

Here&#39;s an example of a permissive server response:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
*!*
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
*/!*
```

## Response headers

For cross-origin request, by default JavaScript may only access so-called &quot;safe&quot; response headers:

- `Cache-Control`
- `Content-Language`
- `Content-Type`
- `Expires`
- `Last-Modified`
- `Pragma`

Accessing any other response header causes an error.

```smart
There&#39;s no `Content-Length` header in the list!

This header contains the full response length. So, if we&#39;re downloading something and would like to track the percentage of progress, then an additional permission is required to access that header (see below).
```

To grant JavaScript access to any other response header, the server must send the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header. It contains a comma-separated list of unsafe header names that should be made accessible.

For example:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 12345
API-Key: 2c9de507f2c54aa1
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
*!*
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length,API-Key
*/!*
```

With such an `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header, the script is allowed to read the `Content-Length` and `API-Key` headers of the response.

## &quot;Unsafe&quot; requests

We can use any HTTP-method: not just `GET/POST`, but also `PATCH`, `DELETE` and others.

Some time ago no one could even imagine that a webpage could make such requests. So there may still exist webservices that treat a non-standard method as a signal: &quot;That&#39;s not a browser&quot;. They can take it into account when checking access rights.

So, to avoid misunderstandings, any &quot;unsafe&quot; request -- that couldn&#39;t be done in the old times, the browser does not make such requests right away. First, it sends a preliminary, so-called &quot;preflight&quot; request, to ask for permission.

A preflight request uses the method `OPTIONS`, no body and two headers:

- `Access-Control-Request-Method` header has the method of the unsafe request.
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provides a comma-separated list of its unsafe HTTP-headers.

If the server agrees to serve the requests, then it should respond with empty body, status 200 and headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must be either `*` or the requesting origin, such as `https://javascript.info`, to allow it.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` must have the allowed method.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` must have a list of allowed headers.
- Additionally, the header `Access-Control-Max-Age` may specify a number of seconds to cache the permissions. So the browser won&#39;t have to send a preflight for subsequent requests that satisfy given permissions.

![](xhr-preflight.svg)

Let&#39;s see how it works step-by-step on the example of a cross-origin `PATCH` request (this method is often used to update data):

```js
let response = await fetch(&quot;https://site.com/service.json&quot;, {
  method: &quot;PATCH&quot;,
  headers: {
    &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,
    &quot;API-Key&quot;: &quot;secret&quot;,
  },
});
```

There are three reasons why the request is unsafe (one is enough):

- Method `PATCH`
- `Content-Type` is not one of: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, `text/plain`.
- &quot;Unsafe&quot; `API-Key` header.

### Step 1 (preflight request)

Prior to sending such a request, the browser, on its own, sends a preflight request that looks like this:

```http
OPTIONS /service.json
Host: site.com
Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Request-Method: PATCH
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key
```

- Method: `OPTIONS`.
- The path -- exactly the same as the main request: `/service.json`.
- Cross-origin special headers:
  - `Origin` -- the source origin.
  - `Access-Control-Request-Method` -- requested method.
  - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` -- a comma-separated list of &quot;unsafe&quot; headers.

### Step 2 (preflight response)

The server should respond with status 200 and the headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PATCH`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key`.

That allows future communication, otherwise an error is triggered.

If the server expects other methods and headers in the future, it makes sense to allow them in advance by adding them to the list.

For example, this response also allows `PUT`, `DELETE` and additional headers:

```http
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT,PATCH,DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: API-Key,Content-Type,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

Now the browser can see that `PATCH` is in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Content-Type,API-Key` are in the list `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, so it sends out the main request.

If there&#39;s the header `Access-Control-Max-Age` with a number of seconds, then the preflight permissions are cached for the given time. The response above will be cached for 86400 seconds (one day). Within this timeframe, subsequent requests will not cause a preflight. Assuming that they fit the cached allowances, they will be sent directly.

### Step 3 (actual request)

When the preflight is successful, the browser now makes the main request. The process here is the same as for safe requests.

The main request has the `Origin` header (because it&#39;s cross-origin):

```http
PATCH /service.json
Host: site.com
Content-Type: application/json
API-Key: secret
Origin: https://javascript.info
```

### Step 4 (actual response)

The server should not forget to add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the main response. A successful preflight does not relieve from that:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
```

Then JavaScript is able to read the main server response.

```smart
Preflight request occurs &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, it&#39;s invisible to JavaScript.

JavaScript only gets the response to the main request or an error if there&#39;s no server permission.
```

## Credentials

A cross-origin request initiated by JavaScript code by default does not bring any credentials (cookies or HTTP authentication).

That&#39;s uncommon for HTTP-requests. Usually, a request to `http://site.com` is accompanied by all cookies from that domain. Cross-origin requests made by JavaScript methods on the other hand are an exception.

For example, `fetch(&#39;http://another.com&#39;)` does not send any cookies, even those (!) that belong to `another.com` domain.

Why?

That&#39;s because a request with credentials is much more powerful than without them. If allowed, it grants JavaScript the full power to act on behalf of the user and access sensitive information using their credentials.

Does the server really trust the script that much? Then it must explicitly allow requests with credentials with an additional header.

To send credentials in `fetch`, we need to add the option `credentials: &quot;include&quot;`, like this:

```js
fetch(&quot;http://another.com&quot;, {
  credentials: &quot;include&quot;,
});
```

Now `fetch` sends cookies originating from `another.com` with request to that site.

If the server agrees to accept the request _with credentials_, it should add a header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to the response, in addition to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

For example:

```http
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Please note: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is prohibited from using a star `*` for requests with credentials. Like shown above, it must provide the exact origin there. That&#39;s an additional safety measure, to ensure that the server really knows who it trusts to make such requests.

## Summary

From the browser point of view, there are two kinds of cross-origin requests: &quot;safe&quot; and all the others.

&quot;Safe&quot; requests must satisfy the following conditions:

- Method: GET, POST or HEAD.
- Headers -- we can set only:
  - `Accept`
  - `Accept-Language`
  - `Content-Language`
  - `Content-Type` to the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.

The essential difference is that safe requests were doable since ancient times using `&lt;form&gt;` or `&lt;script&gt;` tags, while unsafe were impossible for browsers for a long time.

So, the practical difference is that safe requests are sent right away, with the `Origin` header, while for the other ones the browser makes a preliminary &quot;preflight&quot; request, asking for permission.

**For safe requests:**

- → The browser sends the `Origin` header with the origin.
- ← For requests without credentials (not sent by default), the server should set:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` or same value as `Origin`
- ← For requests with credentials, the server should set:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to same value as `Origin`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true`

Additionally, to grant JavaScript access to any response headers except `Cache-Control`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified` or `Pragma`, the server should list the allowed ones in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.

**For unsafe requests, a preliminary &quot;preflight&quot; request is issued before the requested one:**

- → The browser sends an `OPTIONS` request to the same URL, with the headers:
  - `Access-Control-Request-Method` has requested method.
  - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` lists unsafe requested headers.
- ← The server should respond with status 200 and the headers:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` with a list of allowed methods,
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` with a list of allowed headers,
  - `Access-Control-Max-Age` with a number of seconds to cache the permissions.
- Then the actual request is sent, and the previous &quot;safe&quot; scheme is applied.

# Fetch API

So far, we know quite a bit about `fetch`.

Let&#39;s see the rest of API, to cover all its abilities.

```smart
Please note: most of these options are used rarely. You may skip this chapter and still use `fetch` well.

Still, it&#39;s good to know what `fetch` can do, so if the need arises, you can return and read the details.
```

Here&#39;s the full list of all possible `fetch` options with their default values (alternatives in comments):

```js
let promise = fetch(url, {
  method: &quot;GET&quot;, // POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  headers: {
    // the content type header value is usually auto-set
    // depending on the request body
    &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain;charset=UTF-8&quot;
  },
  body: undefined // string, FormData, Blob, BufferSource, or URLSearchParams
  referrer: &quot;about:client&quot;, // or &quot;&quot; to send no Referer header,
  // or an url from the current origin
  referrerPolicy: &quot;no-referrer-when-downgrade&quot;, // no-referrer, origin, same-origin...
  mode: &quot;cors&quot;, // same-origin, no-cors
  credentials: &quot;same-origin&quot;, // omit, include
  cache: &quot;default&quot;, // no-store, reload, no-cache, force-cache, or only-if-cached
  redirect: &quot;follow&quot;, // manual, error
  integrity: &quot;&quot;, // a hash, like &quot;sha256-abcdef1234567890&quot;
  keepalive: false, // true
  signal: undefined, // AbortController to abort request
  window: window // null
});
```

An impressive list, right?

We fully covered `method`, `headers` and `body` in the chapter &lt;info:fetch&gt;.

The `signal` option is covered in &lt;info:fetch-abort&gt;.

Now let&#39;s explore the remaining capabilities.

## referrer, referrerPolicy

These options govern how `fetch` sets the HTTP `Referer` header.

Usually that header is set automatically and contains the url of the page that made the request. In most scenarios, it&#39;s not important at all, sometimes, for security purposes, it makes sense to remove or shorten it.

**The `referrer` option allows to set any `Referer` (within the current origin) or remove it.**

To send no referer, set an empty string:

```js
fetch(&#39;/page&#39;, {
*!*
  referrer: &quot;&quot; // no Referer header
*/!*
});
```

To set another url within the current origin:

```js
fetch(&#39;/page&#39;, {
  // assuming we&#39;re on https://javascript.info
  // we can set any Referer header, but only within the current origin
*!*
  referrer: &quot;https://javascript.info/anotherpage&quot;
*/!*
});
```

**The `referrerPolicy` option sets general rules for `Referer`.**

Requests are split into 3 types:

1. Request to the same origin.
2. Request to another origin.
3. Request from HTTPS to HTTP (from safe to unsafe protocol).

Unlike the `referrer` option that allows to set the exact `Referer` value, `referrerPolicy` tells the browser general rules for each request type.

Possible values are described in the [Referrer Policy specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/):

- **`&quot;no-referrer-when-downgrade&quot;`** -- the default value: full `Referer` is always sent, unless we send a request from HTTPS to HTTP (to the less secure protocol).
- **`&quot;no-referrer&quot;`** -- never send `Referer`.
- **`&quot;origin&quot;`** -- only send the origin in `Referer`, not the full page URL, e.g. only `http://site.com` instead of `http://site.com/path`.
- **`&quot;origin-when-cross-origin&quot;`** -- send the full `Referer` to the same origin, but only the origin part for cross-origin requests (as above).
- **`&quot;same-origin&quot;`** -- send the full `Referer` to the same origin, but no `Referer` for cross-origin requests.
- **`&quot;strict-origin&quot;`** -- send only the origin, not the `Referer` for HTTPS→HTTP requests.
- **`&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot;`** -- for same-origin send the full `Referer`, for cross-origin send only the origin, unless it&#39;s HTTPS→HTTP request, then send nothing.
- **`&quot;unsafe-url&quot;`** -- always send the full url in `Referer`, even for HTTPS→HTTP requests.

Here&#39;s a table with all combinations:

| Value                                            | To same origin | To another origin | HTTPS→HTTP |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| `&quot;no-referrer&quot;`                                  | -              | -                 | -          |
| `&quot;no-referrer-when-downgrade&quot;` or `&quot;&quot;` (default) | full           | full              | -          |
| `&quot;origin&quot;`                                       | origin         | origin            | origin     |
| `&quot;origin-when-cross-origin&quot;`                     | full           | origin            | origin     |
| `&quot;same-origin&quot;`                                  | full           | -                 | -          |
| `&quot;strict-origin&quot;`                                | origin         | origin            | -          |
| `&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot;`              | full           | origin            | -          |
| `&quot;unsafe-url&quot;`                                   | full           | full              | full       |

Let&#39;s say we have an admin zone with a URL structure that shouldn&#39;t be known from outside of the site.

If we send a `fetch`, then by default it always sends the `Referer` header with the full url of our page (except when we request from HTTPS to HTTP, then no `Referer`).

E.g. `Referer: https://javascript.info/admin/secret/paths`.

If we&#39;d like other websites know only the origin part, not the URL-path, we can set the option:

```js
fetch(&quot;https://another.com/page&quot;, {
  // ...
  referrerPolicy: &quot;origin-when-cross-origin&quot;, // Referer: https://javascript.info
});
```

We can put it to all `fetch` calls, maybe integrate into JavaScript library of our project that does all requests and uses `fetch` inside.

Its only difference compared to the default behavior is that for requests to another origin `fetch` sends only the origin part of the URL (e.g. `https://javascript.info`, without path). For requests to our origin we still get the full `Referer` (maybe useful for debugging purposes).

```smart header=&quot;Referrer policy is not only for `fetch`&quot; Referrer policy, described in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/), is not just for `fetch`, but more global.

In particular, it&#39;s possible to set the default policy for the whole page using the `Referrer-Policy` HTTP header, or per-link, with `&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;`.

````

## mode

The `mode` option is a safe-guard that prevents occasional cross-origin requests:

- **`&quot;cors&quot;`** -- the default, cross-origin requests are allowed, as described in &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt;,
- **`&quot;same-origin&quot;`** -- cross-origin requests are forbidden,
- **`&quot;no-cors&quot;`** -- only safe cross-origin requests are allowed.

This option may be useful when the URL for `fetch` comes from a 3rd-party, and we want a &quot;power off switch&quot; to limit cross-origin capabilities.

## credentials

The `credentials` option specifies whether `fetch` should send cookies and HTTP-Authorization headers with the request.

- **`&quot;same-origin&quot;`** -- the default, don&#39;t send for cross-origin requests,
- **`&quot;include&quot;`** -- always send, requires `Accept-Control-Allow-Credentials` from cross-origin server in order for JavaScript to access the response, that was covered in the chapter &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt;,
- **`&quot;omit&quot;`** -- never send, even for same-origin requests.

## cache

By default, `fetch` requests make use of standard HTTP-caching. That is, it respects the `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers, sends `If-Modified-Since` and so on. Just like regular HTTP-requests do.

The `cache` options allows to ignore HTTP-cache or fine-tune its usage:

- **`&quot;default&quot;`** -- `fetch` uses standard HTTP-cache rules and headers,
- **`&quot;no-store&quot;`** -- totally ignore HTTP-cache, this mode becomes the default if we set a header `If-Modified-Since`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Unmodified-Since`, `If-Match`, or `If-Range`,
- **`&quot;reload&quot;`** -- don&#39;t take the result from HTTP-cache (if any), but populate the cache with the response (if the response headers permit this action),
- **`&quot;no-cache&quot;`** -- create a conditional request if there is a cached response, and a normal request otherwise. Populate HTTP-cache with the response,
- **`&quot;force-cache&quot;`** -- use a response from HTTP-cache, even if it&#39;s stale. If there&#39;s no response in HTTP-cache, make a regular HTTP-request, behave normally,
- **`&quot;only-if-cached&quot;`** -- use a response from HTTP-cache, even if it&#39;s stale. If there&#39;s no response in HTTP-cache, then error. Only works when `mode` is `&quot;same-origin&quot;`.

## redirect

Normally, `fetch` transparently follows HTTP-redirects, like 301, 302 etc.

The `redirect` option allows to change that:

- **`&quot;follow&quot;`** -- the default, follow HTTP-redirects,
- **`&quot;error&quot;`** -- error in case of HTTP-redirect,
- **`&quot;manual&quot;`** -- allows to process HTTP-redirects manually. In case of redirect, we&#39;ll get a special response object, with `response.type=&quot;opaqueredirect&quot;` and zeroed/empty status and most other properies.

## integrity

The `integrity` option allows to check if the response matches the known-ahead checksum.

As described in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/), supported hash-functions are SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, there might be others depending on the browser.

For example, we&#39;re downloading a file, and we know that it&#39;s SHA-256 checksum is &quot;abcdef&quot; (a real checksum is longer, of course).

We can put it in the `integrity` option, like this:

```js
fetch(&#39;http://site.com/file&#39;, {
  integrity: &#39;sha256-abcdef&#39;
});
````

Then `fetch` will calculate SHA-256 on its own and compare it with our string. In case of a mismatch, an error is triggered.

## keepalive

The `keepalive` option indicates that the request may &quot;outlive&quot; the webpage that initiated it.

For example, we gather statistics on how the current visitor uses our page (mouse clicks, page fragments he views), to analyze and improve the user experience.

When the visitor leaves our page -- we&#39;d like to save the data to our server.

We can use the `window.onunload` event for that:

```js run
window.onunload = function() {
  fetch(&#39;/analytics&#39;, {
    method: &#39;POST&#39;,
    body: &quot;statistics&quot;,
*!*
    keepalive: true
*/!*
  });
};
```

Normally, when a document is unloaded, all associated network requests are aborted. But the `keepalive` option tells the browser to perform the request in the background, even after it leaves the page. So this option is essential for our request to succeed.

It has a few limitations:

- We can&#39;t send megabytes: the body limit for `keepalive` requests is 64KB.
  - If we need to gather a lot of statistics about the visit, we should send it out regularly in packets, so that there won&#39;t be a lot left for the last `onunload` request.
  - This limit applies to all `keepalive` requests together. In other words, we can perform multiple `keepalive` requests in parallel, but the sum of their body lengths should not exceed 64KB.
- We can&#39;t handle the server response if the document is unloaded. So in our example `fetch` will succeed due to `keepalive`, but subsequent functions won&#39;t work.
  - In most cases, such as sending out statistics, it&#39;s not a problem, as the server just accepts the data and usually sends an empty response to such requests.

# URL objects

The built-in [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api) class provides a convenient interface for creating and parsing URLs.

There are no networking methods that require exactly a `URL` object, strings are good enough. So technically we don&#39;t have to use `URL`. But sometimes it can be really helpful.

## Creating a URL

The syntax to create a new `URL` object:

```js
new URL(url, [base]);
```

- **`url`** -- the full URL or only path (if base is set, see below),
- **`base`** -- an optional base URL: if set and `url` argument has only path, then the URL is generated relative to `base`.

For example:

```js
let url = new URL(&quot;https://javascript.info/profile/admin&quot;);
```

These two URLs are same:

```js run
let url1 = new URL(&quot;https://javascript.info/profile/admin&quot;);
let url2 = new URL(&quot;/profile/admin&quot;, &quot;https://javascript.info&quot;);

alert(url1); // https://javascript.info/profile/admin
alert(url2); // https://javascript.info/profile/admin
```

We can easily create a new URL based on the path relative to an existing URL:

```js run
let url = new URL(&quot;https://javascript.info/profile/admin&quot;);
let newUrl = new URL(&quot;tester&quot;, url);

alert(newUrl); // https://javascript.info/profile/tester
```

The `URL` object immediately allows us to access its components, so it&#39;s a nice way to parse the url, e.g.:

```js run
let url = new URL(&quot;https://javascript.info/url&quot;);

alert(url.protocol); // https:
alert(url.host); // javascript.info
alert(url.pathname); // /url
```

Here&#39;s the cheatsheet for URL components:

![](url-object.svg)

- `href` is the full url, same as `url.toString()`
- `protocol` ends with the colon character `:`
- `search` - a string of parameters, starts with the question mark `?`
- `hash` starts with the hash character `#`
- there may be also `user` and `password` properties if HTTP authentication is present: `http://login:password@site.com` (not painted above, rarely used).

```smart header=&quot;We can pass `URL`objects to networking (and most other) methods instead of a string&quot; We can use a`URL`object in`fetch`or`XMLHttpRequest`, almost everywhere where a URL-string is expected.

Generally, the `URL` object can be passed to any method instead of a string, as most methods will perform the string conversion, that turns a `URL` object into a string with full URL.

````

## SearchParams &quot;?...&quot;

Let&#39;s say we want to create a url with given search params, for instance, `https://google.com/search?query=JavaScript`.

We can provide them in the URL string:

```js
new URL(&#39;https://google.com/search?query=JavaScript&#39;)
````

...But parameters need to be encoded if they contain spaces, non-latin letters, etc (more about that below).

So there&#39;s a URL property for that: `url.searchParams`, an object of type [URLSearchParams](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams).

It provides convenient methods for search parameters:

- **`append(name, value)`** -- add the parameter by `name`,
- **`delete(name)`** -- remove the parameter by `name`,
- **`get(name)`** -- get the parameter by `name`,
- **`getAll(name)`** -- get all parameters with the same `name` (that&#39;s possible, e.g. `?user=John&amp;user=Pete`),
- **`has(name)`** -- check for the existence of the parameter by `name`,
- **`set(name, value)`** -- set/replace the parameter,
- **`sort()`** -- sort parameters by name, rarely needed,
- ...and it&#39;s also iterable, similar to `Map`.

An example with parameters that contain spaces and punctuation marks:

```js run
let url = new URL(&quot;https://google.com/search&quot;);

url.searchParams.set(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;test me!&quot;); // added parameter with a space and !

alert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=test+me%21

url.searchParams.set(&quot;tbs&quot;, &quot;qdr:y&quot;); // added parameter with a colon :

// parameters are automatically encoded
alert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=test+me%21&amp;tbs=qdr%3Ay

// iterate over search parameters (decoded)
for (let [name, value] of url.searchParams) {
  alert(`${name}=${value}`); // q=test me!, then tbs=qdr:y
}
```

## Encoding

There&#39;s a standard [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) that defines which characters are allowed in URLs and which are not.

Those that are not allowed, must be encoded, for instance non-latin letters and spaces - replaced with their UTF-8 codes, prefixed by `%`, such as `%20` (a space can be encoded by `+`, for historical reasons, but that&#39;s an exception).

The good news is that `URL` objects handle all that automatically. We just supply all parameters unencoded, and then convert the `URL` to string:

```js run
// using some cyrillic characters for this example

let url = new URL(&quot;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Тест&quot;);

url.searchParams.set(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;ъ&quot;);
alert(url); //https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82?key=%D1%8A
```

As you can see, both `Тест` in the url path and `ъ` in the parameter are encoded.

The URL became longer, because each cyrillic letter is represented with two bytes in UTF-8, so there are two `%..` entities.

### Encoding strings

In old times, before `URL` objects appeared, people used strings for URLs.

As of now, `URL` objects are often more convenient, but strings can still be used as well. In many cases using a string makes the code shorter.

If we use a string though, we need to encode/decode special characters manually.

There are built-in functions for that:

- [encodeURI](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI) - encodes URL as a whole.
- [decodeURI](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI) - decodes it back.
- [encodeURIComponent](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) - encodes a URL component, such as a search parameter, or a hash, or a pathname.
- [decodeURIComponent](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent) - decodes it back.

A natural question is: &quot;What&#39;s the difference between `encodeURIComponent` and `encodeURI`? When we should use either?&quot;

That&#39;s easy to understand if we look at the URL, that&#39;s split into components in the picture above:

```
https://site.com:8080/path/page?p1=v1&amp;p2=v2#hash
```

As we can see, characters such as `:`, `?`, `=`, `&amp;`, `#` are allowed in URL.

...On the other hand, if we look at a single URL component, such as a search parameter, these characters must be encoded, not to break the formatting.

- `encodeURI` encodes only characters that are totally forbidden in URL.
- `encodeURIComponent` encodes same characters, and, in addition to them, characters `#`, `$`, `&amp;`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `?` and `@`.

So, for a whole URL we can use `encodeURI`:

```js run
// using cyrillic characters in url path
let url = encodeURI(&quot;http://site.com/привет&quot;);

alert(url); // http://site.com/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82
```

...While for URL parameters we should use `encodeURIComponent` instead:

```js run
let music = encodeURIComponent(&quot;Rock&amp;Roll&quot;);

let url = `https://google.com/search?q=${music}`;
alert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=Rock%26Roll
```

Compare it with `encodeURI`:

```js run
let music = encodeURI(&quot;Rock&amp;Roll&quot;);

let url = `https://google.com/search?q=${music}`;
alert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=Rock&amp;Roll
```

As we can see, `encodeURI` does not encode `&amp;`, as this is a legit character in URL as a whole.

But we should encode `&amp;` inside a search parameter, otherwise, we get `q=Rock&amp;Roll` - that is actually `q=Rock` plus some obscure parameter `Roll`. Not as intended.

So we should use only `encodeURIComponent` for each search parameter, to correctly insert it in the URL string. The safest is to encode both name and value, unless we&#39;re absolutely sure that it has only allowed characters.

````smart header=&quot;Encoding difference compared to `URL`&quot; Classes [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-class) and [URLSearchParams](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-urlsearchparams) are based on the latest URI specification: [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), while `encode\*` functions are based on the obsolete version [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

There are a few differences, e.g. IPv6 addresses are encoded differently:

```js run
// valid url with IPv6 address
let url = &quot;http://[2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007]/&quot;;

alert(encodeURI(url)); // http://%5B2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007%5D/
alert(new URL(url)); // http://[2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007]/
```

As we can see, `encodeURI` replaced square brackets `[...]`, that&#39;s not correct, the reason is: IPv6 urls did not exist at the time of RFC2396 (August 1998).

Such cases are rare, `encode*` functions work well most of the time.

<h1 id="xmlhttprequest">XMLHttpRequest</h1>
<p><code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is a built-in browser object that allows to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Despite of having the word “XML” in its name, it can operate on any data, not only in XML format. We can upload/download files, track progress and much more.</p>
<p>Right now, there’s another, more modern method <code>fetch</code>, that somewhat deprecates <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
<p>In modern web-development <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is used for three reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Historical reasons: we need to support existing scripts with <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</li>
<li>We need to support old browsers, and don’t want polyfills (e.g. to keep scripts tiny).</li>
<li>We need something that <code>fetch</code> can’t do yet, e.g. to track upload progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that sound familiar? If yes, then all right, go on with <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. Otherwise, please head on to <a href="info:fetch" class="uri">info:fetch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>
<p>XMLHttpRequest has two modes of operation: synchronous and asynchronous.</p>
<p>Let’s see the asynchronous first, as it’s used in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>To do the request, we need 3 steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>: <code>js  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();</code> The constructor has no arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize it, usually right after <code>new XMLHttpRequest</code>: <code>js  xhr.open(method, URL, [async, user, password])</code></p>
<p>This method specifies the main parameters of the request:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>method</code> – HTTP-method. Usually <code>"GET"</code> or <code>"POST"</code>.</li>
<li><code>URL</code> – the URL to request, a string, can be <a href="info:url">URL</a> object.</li>
<li><code>async</code> – if explicitly set to <code>false</code>, then the request is synchronous, we’ll cover that a bit later.</li>
<li><code>user</code>, <code>password</code> – login and password for basic HTTP auth (if required).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <code>open</code> call, contrary to its name, does not open the connection. It only configures the request, but the network activity only starts with the call of <code>send</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Send it out.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb40-1" title="1"><span class="va">xhr</span>.<span class="at">send</span>([body])</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This method opens the connection and sends the request to server. The optional <code>body</code> parameter contains the request body.</p>
<p>Some request methods like <code>GET</code> do not have a body. And some of them like <code>POST</code> use <code>body</code> to send the data to the server. We’ll see examples of that later.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to <code>xhr</code> events for response.</p>
These three events are the most widely used:
<ul>
<li><code>load</code> – when the request is complete (even if HTTP status is like 400 or 500), and the response is fully downloaded.</li>
<li><code>error</code> – when the request couldn’t be made, e.g. network down or invalid URL.</li>
<li><code>progress</code> – triggers periodically while the response is being downloaded, reports how much has been downloaded.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>Here’s a full example. The code below loads the URL at <code>/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load</code> from the server and prints the progress:</p>
<p>```js run // 1. Create a new XMLHttpRequest object let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();</p>
<p>// 2. Configure it: GET-request for the URL /article/…/load xhr.open(‘GET’, ‘/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load’);</p>
<p>// 3. Send the request over the network xhr.send();</p>
<p>// 4. This will be called after the response is received xhr.onload = function() { if (xhr.status != 200) { // analyze HTTP status of the response alert(<code>Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}</code>); // e.g. 404: Not Found } else { // show the result alert(<code>Done, got ${xhr.response.length} bytes</code>); // response is the server response } };</p>
<p>xhr.onprogress = function(event) { if (event.lengthComputable) { alert(<code>Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes</code>); } else { alert(<code>Received ${event.loaded} bytes</code>); // no Content-Length }</p>
<p>};</p>
<p>xhr.onerror = function() { alert(“Request failed”); }; ```</p>
<p>Once the server has responded, we can receive the result in the following <code>xhr</code> properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>status</code></dt>
<dd>HTTP status code (a number): <code>200</code>, <code>404</code>, <code>403</code> and so on, can be <code>0</code> in case of a non-HTTP failure.
</dd>
<dt><code>statusText</code></dt>
<dd>HTTP status message (a string): usually <code>OK</code> for <code>200</code>, <code>Not Found</code> for <code>404</code>, <code>Forbidden</code> for <code>403</code> and so on.
</dd>
<dt><code>response</code> (old scripts may use <code>responseText</code>)</dt>
<dd>The server response body.
</dd>

## Response Type

We can use `xhr.responseType` property to set the response format:

- `&quot;&quot;` (default) -- get as string,
- `&quot;text&quot;` -- get as string,
- `&quot;arraybuffer&quot;` -- get as `ArrayBuffer` (for binary data, see chapter &lt;info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays&gt;),
- `&quot;blob&quot;` -- get as `Blob` (for binary data, see chapter &lt;info:blob&gt;),
- `&quot;document&quot;` -- get as XML document (can use XPath and other XML methods) or HTML document (based on the MIME type of the received data),
- `&quot;json&quot;` -- get as JSON (parsed automatically).

For example, let&#39;s get the response as JSON:

```js run
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open(&#39;GET&#39;, &#39;/article/xmlhttprequest/example/json&#39;);

*!*
xhr.responseType = &#39;json&#39;;
*/!*

xhr.send();

// the response is {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;}
xhr.onload = function() {
  let responseObj = xhr.response;
  alert(responseObj.message); // Hello, world!
};
```

```smart
In the old scripts you may also find `xhr.responseText` and even `xhr.responseXML` properties.

They exist for historical reasons, to get either a string or XML document. Nowadays, we should set the format in `xhr.responseType` and get `xhr.response` as demonstrated above.
```

## Ready states

`XMLHttpRequest` changes between states as it progresses. The current state is accessible as `xhr.readyState`.

All states, as in [the specification](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#states):

```js
UNSENT = 0; // initial state
OPENED = 1; // open called
HEADERS_RECEIVED = 2; // response headers received
LOADING = 3; // response is loading (a data packet is received)
DONE = 4; // request complete
```

An `XMLHttpRequest` object travels them in the order `0` -&gt; `1` -&gt; `2` -&gt; `3` -&gt; ... -&gt; `3` -&gt; `4`. State `3` repeats every time a data packet is received over the network.

We can track them using `readystatechange` event:

```js
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState == 3) {
    // loading
  }
  if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
    // request finished
  }
};
```

You can find `readystatechange` listeners in really old code, it&#39;s there for historical reasons, as there was a time when there were no `load` and other events. Nowadays, `load/error/progress` handlers deprecate it.

## Aborting request

We can terminate the request at any time. The call to `xhr.abort()` does that:

```js
xhr.abort(); // terminate the request
```

That triggers `abort` event, and `xhr.status` becomes `0`.

## Synchronous requests

If in the `open` method the third parameter `async` is set to `false`, the request is made synchronously.

In other words, JavaScript execution pauses at `send()` and resumes when the response is received. Somewhat like `alert` or `prompt` commands.

Here&#39;s the rewritten example, the 3rd parameter of `open` is `false`:

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open(&#39;GET&#39;, &#39;/article/xmlhttprequest/hello.txt&#39;, *!*false*/!*);

try {
  xhr.send();
  if (xhr.status != 200) {
    alert(`Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}`);
  } else {
    alert(xhr.response);
  }
} catch(err) { // instead of onerror
  alert(&quot;Request failed&quot;);
}
```

It might look good, but synchronous calls are used rarely, because they block in-page JavaScript till the loading is complete. In some browsers it becomes impossible to scroll. If a synchronous call takes too much time, the browser may suggest to close the &quot;hanging&quot; webpage.

Many advanced capabilities of `XMLHttpRequest`, like requesting from another domain or specifying a timeout, are unavailable for synchronous requests. Also, as you can see, no progress indication.

Because of all that, synchronous requests are used very sparingly, almost never. We won&#39;t talk about them any more.

## HTTP-headers

`XMLHttpRequest` allows both to send custom headers and read headers from the response.

There are 3 methods for HTTP-headers:

`setRequestHeader(name, value)`
: Sets the request header with the given `name` and `value`.

    For instance:

    ```js
    xhr.setRequestHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
    ```

    ```warn header=&quot;Headers limitations&quot;
    Several headers are managed exclusively by the browser, e.g. `Referer` and `Host`.
    The full list is [in the specification](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-setrequestheader()-method).

    `XMLHttpRequest` is not allowed to change them, for the sake of user safety and correctness of the request.
    ```

    ````warn header=&quot;Can&#39;t remove a header&quot;
    Another peculiarity of `XMLHttpRequest` is that one can&#39;t undo `setRequestHeader`.

    Once the header is set, it&#39;s set. Additional calls add information to the header, don&#39;t overwrite it.

    For instance:

    ```js
    xhr.setRequestHeader(&#39;X-Auth&#39;, &#39;123&#39;);
    xhr.setRequestHeader(&#39;X-Auth&#39;, &#39;456&#39;);

    // the header will be:
    // X-Auth: 123, 456
    ```
    ````

`getResponseHeader(name)`
: Gets the response header with the given `name` (except `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2`).

    For instance:

    ```js
    xhr.getResponseHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;)
    ```

`getAllResponseHeaders()`
: Returns all response headers, except `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2`.

    Headers are returned as a single line, e.g.:

    ```http
    Cache-Control: max-age=31536000
    Content-Length: 4260
    Content-Type: image/png
    Date: Sat, 08 Sep 2012 16:53:16 GMT
    ```

    The line break between headers is always `&quot;\r\n&quot;` (doesn&#39;t depend on OS), so we can easily split it into individual headers. The separator between the name and the value is always a colon followed by a space `&quot;: &quot;`. That&#39;s fixed in the specification.

    So, if we want to get an object with name/value pairs, we need to throw in a bit JS.

    Like this (assuming that if two headers have the same name, then the latter one overwrites the former one):

    ```js
    let headers = xhr
      .getAllResponseHeaders()
      .split(&#39;\r\n&#39;)
      .reduce((result, current) =&gt; {
        let [name, value] = current.split(&#39;: &#39;);
        result[name] = value;
        return result;
      }, {});

    // headers[&#39;Content-Type&#39;] = &#39;image/png&#39;
    ```

## POST, FormData

To make a POST request, we can use the built-in [FormData](mdn:api/FormData) object.

The syntax:

```js
let formData = new FormData([form]); // creates an object, optionally fill from &lt;form&gt;
formData.append(name, value); // appends a field
```

We create it, optionally fill from a form, `append` more fields if needed, and then:

1. `xhr.open(&#39;POST&#39;, ...)` – use `POST` method.
2. `xhr.send(formData)` to submit the form to the server.

For instance:

```html run refresh
&lt;form name=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;John&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  // pre-fill FormData from the form
  let formData = new FormData(document.forms.person);

  // add one more field
  formData.append(&quot;middle&quot;, &quot;Lee&quot;);

  // send it out
  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open(&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;/article/xmlhttprequest/post/user&quot;);
  xhr.send(formData);

  xhr.onload = () =&gt; alert(xhr.response);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The form is sent with `multipart/form-data` encoding.

Or, if we like JSON more, then `JSON.stringify` and send as a string.

Just don&#39;t forget to set the header `Content-Type: application/json`, many server-side frameworks automatically decode JSON with it:

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

let json = JSON.stringify({
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  surname: &quot;Smith&quot;,
});

xhr.open(&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;/submit&quot;);
xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;Content-type&quot;, &quot;application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;);

xhr.send(json);
```

The `.send(body)` method is pretty omnivore. It can send almost any `body`, including `Blob` and `BufferSource` objects.

## Upload progress

The `progress` event triggers only on the downloading stage.

That is: if we `POST` something, `XMLHttpRequest` first uploads our data (the request body), then downloads the response.

If we&#39;re uploading something big, then we&#39;re surely more interested in tracking the upload progress. But `xhr.onprogress` doesn&#39;t help here.

There&#39;s another object, without methods, exclusively to track upload events: `xhr.upload`.

It generates events, similar to `xhr`, but `xhr.upload` triggers them solely on uploading:

- `loadstart` -- upload started.
- `progress` -- triggers periodically during the upload.
- `abort` -- upload aborted.
- `error` -- non-HTTP error.
- `load` -- upload finished successfully.
- `timeout` -- upload timed out (if `timeout` property is set).
- `loadend` -- upload finished with either success or error.

Example of handlers:

```js
xhr.upload.onprogress = function (event) {
  alert(`Uploaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes`);
};

xhr.upload.onload = function () {
  alert(`Upload finished successfully.`);
};

xhr.upload.onerror = function () {
  alert(`Error during the upload: ${xhr.status}`);
};
```

Here&#39;s a real-life example: file upload with progress indication:

```html run
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; onchange=&quot;upload(this.files[0])&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function upload(file) {
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    // track upload progress
  *!*
    xhr.upload.onprogress = function(event) {
      console.log(`Uploaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`);
    };
  */!*

    // track completion: both successful or not
    xhr.onloadend = function() {
      if (xhr.status == 200) {
        console.log(&quot;success&quot;);
      } else {
        console.log(&quot;error &quot; + this.status);
      }
    };

    xhr.open(&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;/article/xmlhttprequest/post/upload&quot;);
    xhr.send(file);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Cross-origin requests

`XMLHttpRequest` can make cross-origin requests, using the same CORS policy as [fetch](info:fetch-crossorigin).

Just like `fetch`, it doesn&#39;t send cookies and HTTP-authorization to another origin by default. To enable them, set `xhr.withCredentials` to `true`:

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
*!*
xhr.withCredentials = true;
*/!*

xhr.open(&#39;POST&#39;, &#39;http://anywhere.com/request&#39;);
...
```

See the chapter &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt; for details about cross-origin headers.

## Summary

Typical code of the GET-request with `XMLHttpRequest`:

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;/my/url&quot;);

xhr.send();

xhr.onload = function () {
  if (xhr.status != 200) {
    // HTTP error?
    // handle error
    alert(&quot;Error: &quot; + xhr.status);
    return;
  }

  // get the response from xhr.response
};

xhr.onprogress = function (event) {
  // report progress
  alert(`Loaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`);
};

xhr.onerror = function () {
  // handle non-HTTP error (e.g. network down)
};
```

There are actually more events, the [modern specification](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#events) lists them (in the lifecycle order):

- `loadstart` -- the request has started.
- `progress` -- a data packet of the response has arrived, the whole response body at the moment is in `response`.
- `abort` -- the request was canceled by the call `xhr.abort()`.
- `error` -- connection error has occurred, e.g. wrong domain name. Doesn&#39;t happen for HTTP-errors like 404.
- `load` -- the request has finished successfully.
- `timeout` -- the request was canceled due to timeout (only happens if it was set).
- `loadend` -- triggers after `load`, `error`, `timeout` or `abort`.

The `error`, `abort`, `timeout`, and `load` events are mutually exclusive. Only one of them may happen.

The most used events are load completion (`load`), load failure (`error`), or we can use a single `loadend` handler and check the properties of the request object `xhr` to see what happened.

We&#39;ve already seen another event: `readystatechange`. Historically, it appeared long ago, before the specification settled. Nowadays, there&#39;s no need to use it, we can replace it with newer events, but it can often be found in older scripts.

If we need to track uploading specifically, then we should listen to same events on `xhr.upload` object.

# Conditional branching: if, &#39;?&#39;

Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

To do that, we can use the `if` statement and the conditional operator `?`, that&#39;s also called a &quot;question mark&quot; operator.

## The &quot;if&quot; statement

The `if(...)` statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is `true`, executes a block of code.

For example:

```js run
let year = prompt(&#39;In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?&#39;, &#39;&#39;);

*!*
if (year == 2015) alert( &#39;You are right!&#39; );
*/!*
```

In the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (`year == 2015`), but it can be much more complex.

If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:

```js
if (year == 2015) {
  alert(&quot;That&#39;s correct!&quot;);
  alert(&quot;You&#39;re so smart!&quot;);
}
```

We recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces `{}` every time you use an `if` statement, even if there is only one statement to execute. Doing so improves readability.

## Boolean conversion

The `if (…)` statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.

Let&#39;s recall the conversion rules from the chapter &lt;info:type-conversions&gt;:

- A number `0`, an empty string `&quot;&quot;`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` all become `false`. Because of that they are called &quot;falsy&quot; values.
- Other values become `true`, so they are called &quot;truthy&quot;.

So, the code under this condition would never execute:

```js
if (0) { // 0 is falsy
  ...
}
```

...and inside this condition -- it always will:

```js
if (1) { // 1 is truthy
  ...
}
```

We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to `if`, like this:

```js
let cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false

if (cond) {
  ...
}
```

## The &quot;else&quot; clause

The `if` statement may contain an optional &quot;else&quot; block. It executes when the condition is falsy.

For example:

```js run
let year = prompt(
  &quot;In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?&quot;,
  &quot;&quot;
);

if (year == 2015) {
  alert(&quot;You guessed it right!&quot;);
} else {
  alert(&quot;How can you be so wrong?&quot;); // any value except 2015
}
```

## Several conditions: &quot;else if&quot;

Sometimes, we&#39;d like to test several variants of a condition. The `else if` clause lets us do that.

For example:

```js run
let year = prompt(
  &quot;In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?&quot;,
  &quot;&quot;
);

if (year &lt; 2015) {
  alert(&quot;Too early...&quot;);
} else if (year &gt; 2015) {
  alert(&quot;Too late&quot;);
} else {
  alert(&quot;Exactly!&quot;);
}
```

In the code above, JavaScript first checks `year &lt; 2015`. If that is falsy, it goes to the next condition `year &gt; 2015`. If that is also falsy, it shows the last `alert`.

There can be more `else if` blocks. The final `else` is optional.

## Conditional operator &#39;?&#39;

Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.

For instance:

```js run no-beautify
let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt(&#39;How old are you?&#39;, &#39;&#39;);

*!*
if (age &gt; 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}
*/!*

alert(accessAllowed);
```

The so-called &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;question mark&quot; operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.

The operator is represented by a question mark `?`. Sometimes it&#39;s called &quot;ternary&quot;, because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.

The syntax is:

```js
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
```

The `condition` is evaluated: if it&#39;s truthy then `value1` is returned, otherwise -- `value2`.

For example:

```js
let accessAllowed = age &gt; 18 ? true : false;
```

Technically, we can omit the parentheses around `age &gt; 18`. The question mark operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the comparison `&gt;`.

This example will do the same thing as the previous one:

```js
// the comparison operator &quot;age &gt; 18&quot; executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)
let accessAllowed = age &gt; 18 ? true : false;
```

But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.

````smart
In the example above, you can avoid using the question mark operator because the comparison itself returns `true/false`:

```js
// the same
let accessAllowed = age &gt; 18;
```
````

## Multiple &#39;?&#39;

A sequence of question mark operators `?` can return a value that depends on more than one condition.

For instance:

```js run
let age = prompt(&quot;age?&quot;, 18);

let message =
  age &lt; 3
    ? &quot;Hi, baby!&quot;
    : age &lt; 18
    ? &quot;Hello!&quot;
    : age &lt; 100
    ? &quot;Greetings!&quot;
    : &quot;What an unusual age!&quot;;

alert(message);
```

It may be difficult at first to grasp what&#39;s going on. But after a closer look, we can see that it&#39;s just an ordinary sequence of tests:

1. The first question mark checks whether `age &lt; 3`.
2. If true -- it returns `&#39;Hi, baby!&#39;`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the colon &#39;&quot;:&quot;&#39;, checking `age &lt; 18`.
3. If that&#39;s true -- it returns `&#39;Hello!&#39;`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the next colon &#39;&quot;:&quot;&#39;, checking `age &lt; 100`.
4. If that&#39;s true -- it returns `&#39;Greetings!&#39;`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the last colon &#39;&quot;:&quot;&#39;, returning `&#39;What an unusual age!&#39;`.

Here&#39;s how this looks using `if..else`:

```js
if (age &lt; 3) {
  message = &quot;Hi, baby!&quot;;
} else if (age &lt; 18) {
  message = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
} else if (age &lt; 100) {
  message = &quot;Greetings!&quot;;
} else {
  message = &quot;What an unusual age!&quot;;
}
```

## Non-traditional use of &#39;?&#39;

Sometimes the question mark `?` is used as a replacement for `if`:

```js run no-beautify
let company = prompt(&#39;Which company created JavaScript?&#39;, &#39;&#39;);

*!*
(company == &#39;Netscape&#39;) ?
   alert(&#39;Right!&#39;) : alert(&#39;Wrong.&#39;);
*/!*
```

Depending on the condition `company == &#39;Netscape&#39;`, either the first or the second expression after the `?` gets executed and shows an alert.

We don&#39;t assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.

**It&#39;s not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.**

The notation is shorter than the equivalent `if` statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

Here is the same code using `if` for comparison:

```js run no-beautify
let company = prompt(&#39;Which company created JavaScript?&#39;, &#39;&#39;);

*!*
if (company == &#39;Netscape&#39;) {
  alert(&#39;Right!&#39;);
} else {
  alert(&#39;Wrong.&#39;);
}
*/!*
```

Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

The purpose of the question mark operator `?` is to return one value or another depending on its condition. Please use it for exactly that. Use `if` when you need to execute different branches of code.

# Resumable file upload

With `fetch` method it&#39;s fairly easy to upload a file.

How to resume the upload after lost connection? There&#39;s no built-in option for that, but we have the pieces to implement it.

Resumable uploads should come with upload progress indication, as we expect big files (if we may need to resume). So, as `fetch` doesn&#39;t allow to track upload progress, we&#39;ll use [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest).

## Not-so-useful progress event

To resume upload, we need to know how much was uploaded till the connection was lost.

There&#39;s `xhr.upload.onprogress` to track upload progress.

Unfortunately, it won&#39;t help us to resume the upload here, as it triggers when the data is _sent_, but was it received by the server? The browser doesn&#39;t know.

Maybe it was buffered by a local network proxy, or maybe the remote server process just died and couldn&#39;t process them, or it was just lost in the middle and didn&#39;t reach the receiver.

That&#39;s why this event is only useful to show a nice progress bar.

To resume upload, we need to know _exactly_ the number of bytes received by the server. And only the server can tell that, so we&#39;ll make an additional request.

## Algorithm

1. First, create a file id, to uniquely identify the file we&#39;re going to upload:

   ```js
   let fileId = file.name + &quot;-&quot; + file.size + &quot;-&quot; + file.lastModified;
   ```

   That&#39;s needed for resume upload, to tell the server what we&#39;re resuming.

   If the name or the size or the last modification date changes, then there&#39;ll be another `fileId`.

2. Send a request to the server, asking how many bytes it already has, like this:

   ```js
   let response = await fetch(&quot;status&quot;, {
     headers: {
       &quot;X-File-Id&quot;: fileId,
     },
   });

   // The server has that many bytes
   let startByte = +(await response.text());
   ```

   This assumes that the server tracks file uploads by `X-File-Id` header. Should be implemented at server-side.

   If the file doesn&#39;t yet exist at the server, then the server response should be `0`

3. Then, we can use `Blob` method `slice` to send the file from `startByte`:

   ```js
   xhr.open(&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;upload&quot;, true);

   // File id, so that the server knows which file we upload
   xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;X-File-Id&quot;, fileId);

   // The byte we&#39;re resuming from, so the server knows we&#39;re resuming
   xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;X-Start-Byte&quot;, startByte);

   xhr.upload.onprogress = (e) =&gt; {
     console.log(`Uploaded ${startByte + e.loaded} of ${startByte + e.total}`);
   };

   // file can be from input.files[0] or another source
   xhr.send(file.slice(startByte));
   ```

   Here we send the server both file id as `X-File-Id`, so it knows which file we&#39;re uploading, and the starting byte as `X-Start-Byte`, so it knows we&#39;re not uploading it initially, but resuming.

   The server should check its records, and if there was an upload of that file, and the current uploaded size is exactly `X-Start-Byte`, then append the data to it.

Here&#39;s the demo with both client and server code, written on Node.js.

It works only partially on this site, as Node.js is behind another server named Nginx, that buffers uploads, passing them to Node.js when fully complete.

But you can download it and run locally for the full demonstration:

[codetabs src=&quot;upload-resume&quot; height=200]

As we can see, modern networking methods are close to file managers in their capabilities -- control over headers, progress indicator, sending file parts, etc.

We can implement resumable upload and much more.

# Long polling

Long polling is the simplest way of having persistent connection with server, that doesn&#39;t use any specific protocol like WebSocket or Server Side Events.

Being very easy to implement, it&#39;s also good enough in a lot of cases.

## Regular Polling

The simplest way to get new information from the server is periodic polling. That is, regular requests to the server: &quot;Hello, I&#39;m here, do you have any information for me?&quot;. For example, once every 10 seconds.

In response, the server first takes a notice to itself that the client is online, and second - sends a packet of messages it got till that moment.

That works, but there are downsides:

1. Messages are passed with a delay up to 10 seconds (between requests).
2. Even if there are no messages, the server is bombed with requests every 10 seconds, even if the user switched somewhere else or is asleep. That&#39;s quite a load to handle, speaking performance-wise.

So, if we&#39;re talking about a very small service, the approach may be viable, but generally, it needs an improvement.

## Long polling

So-called &quot;long polling&quot; is a much better way to poll the server.

It&#39;s also very easy to implement, and delivers messages without delays.

The flow:

1. A request is sent to the server.
2. The server doesn&#39;t close the connection until it has a message to send.
3. When a message appears - the server responds to the request with it.
4. The browser makes a new request immediately.

The situation when the browser sent a request and has a pending connection with the server, is standard for this method. Only when a message is delivered, the connection is reestablished.

![](long-polling.svg)

If the connection is lost, because of, say, a network error, the browser immediately sends a new request.

A sketch of client-side `subscribe` function that makes long requests:

```js
async function subscribe() {
  let response = await fetch(&quot;/subscribe&quot;);

  if (response.status == 502) {
    // Status 502 is a connection timeout error,
    // may happen when the connection was pending for too long,
    // and the remote server or a proxy closed it
    // let&#39;s reconnect
    await subscribe();
  } else if (response.status != 200) {
    // An error - let&#39;s show it
    showMessage(response.statusText);
    // Reconnect in one second
    await new Promise((resolve) =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    await subscribe();
  } else {
    // Get and show the message
    let message = await response.text();
    showMessage(message);
    // Call subscribe() again to get the next message
    await subscribe();
  }
}

subscribe();
```

As you can see, `subscribe` function makes a fetch, then waits for the response, handles it and calls itself again.

```warn header=&quot;Server should be ok with many pending connections&quot;
The server architecture must be able to work with many pending connections.

Certain server architectures run one process per connection, resulting in there being as many processes as there are connections, while each process consumes quite a bit of memory. So, too many connections will just consume it all.

That&#39;s often the case for backends written in languages like PHP and Ruby.

Servers written using Node.js usually don&#39;t have such problems.

That said, it isn&#39;t a programming language issue. Most modern languages, including PHP and Ruby allow to implement a proper backend. Just please make sure that your server architecture works fine with many simultaneous connections.
```

## Demo: a chat

Here&#39;s a demo chat, you can also download it and run locally (if you&#39;re familiar with Node.js and can install modules):

[codetabs src=&quot;longpoll&quot; height=500]

Browser code is in `browser.js`.

## Area of usage

Long polling works great in situations when messages are rare.

If messages come very often, then the chart of requesting-receiving messages, painted above, becomes saw-like.

Every message is a separate request, supplied with headers, authentication overhead, and so on.

So, in this case, another method is preferred, such as [Websocket](info:websocket) or [Server Sent Events](info:server-sent-events).

# WebSocket

The `WebSocket` protocol, described in the specification [RFC 6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) provides a way to exchange data between browser and server via a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions as &quot;packets&quot;, without breaking the connection and additional HTTP-requests.

WebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time trading systems and so on.

## A simple example

To open a websocket connection, we need to create `new WebSocket` using the special protocol `ws` in the url:

```js
let socket = new WebSocket(&quot;*!*ws*/!*://javascript.info&quot;);
```

There&#39;s also encrypted `wss://` protocol. It&#39;s like HTTPS for websockets.

```smart header=&quot;Always prefer `wss://`&quot; The `wss://` protocol is not only encrypted, but also more reliable.

That&#39;s because `ws://` data is not encrypted, visible for any intermediary. Old proxy servers do not know about WebSocket, they may see &quot;strange&quot; headers and abort the connection.

On the other hand, `wss://` is WebSocket over TLS, (same as HTTPS is HTTP over TLS), the transport security layer encrypts the data at sender and decrypts at the receiver. So data packets are passed encrypted through proxies. They can&#39;t see what&#39;s inside and let them through.

````

Once the socket is created, we should listen to events on it. There are totally 4 events:
- **`open`** -- connection established,
- **`message`** -- data received,
- **`error`** -- websocket error,
- **`close`** -- connection closed.

...And if we&#39;d like to send something, then `socket.send(data)` will do that.

Here&#39;s an example:

```js run
let socket = new WebSocket(&quot;wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello&quot;);

socket.onopen = function(e) {
  alert(&quot;[open] Connection established&quot;);
  alert(&quot;Sending to server&quot;);
  socket.send(&quot;My name is John&quot;);
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  alert(`[message] Data received from server: ${event.data}`);
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
  if (event.wasClean) {
    alert(`[close] Connection closed cleanly, code=${event.code} reason=${event.reason}`);
  } else {
    // e.g. server process killed or network down
    // event.code is usually 1006 in this case
    alert(&#39;[close] Connection died&#39;);
  }
};

socket.onerror = function(error) {
  alert(`[error] ${error.message}`);
};
````

For demo purposes, there&#39;s a small server [server.js](demo/server.js) written in Node.js, for the example above, running. It responds with &quot;Hello from server, John&quot;, then waits 5 seconds and closes the connection.

So you&#39;ll see events `open` -&gt; `message` -&gt; `close`.

That&#39;s actually it, we can talk WebSocket already. Quite simple, isn&#39;t it?

Now let&#39;s talk more in-depth.

## Opening a websocket

When `new WebSocket(url)` is created, it starts connecting immediately.

During the connection the browser (using headers) asks the server: &quot;Do you support Websocket?&quot; And if the server replies &quot;yes&quot;, then the talk continues in WebSocket protocol, which is not HTTP at all.

![](websocket-handshake.svg)

Here&#39;s an example of browser headers for request made by `new WebSocket(&quot;wss://javascript.info/chat&quot;)`.

```
GET /chat
Host: javascript.info
Origin: https://javascript.info
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Key: Iv8io/9s+lYFgZWcXczP8Q==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

- `Origin` -- the origin of the client page, e.g. `https://javascript.info`. WebSocket objects are cross-origin by nature. There are no special headers or other limitations. Old servers are unable to handle WebSocket anyway, so there are no compatibility issues. But `Origin` header is important, as it allows the server to decide whether or not to talk WebSocket with this website.
- `Connection: Upgrade` -- signals that the client would like to change the protocol.
- `Upgrade: websocket` -- the requested protocol is &quot;websocket&quot;.
- `Sec-WebSocket-Key` -- a random browser-generated key for security.
- `Sec-WebSocket-Version` -- WebSocket protocol version, 13 is the current one.

```smart header=&quot;WebSocket handshake can&#39;t be emulated&quot;
We can&#39;t use `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` to make this kind of HTTP-request, because JavaScript is not allowed to set these headers.
```

If the server agrees to switch to WebSocket, it should send code 101 response:

```
101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: hsBlbuDTkk24srzEOTBUlZAlC2g=
```

Here `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` is `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, recoded using a special algorithm. The browser uses it to make sure that the response corresponds to the request.

Afterwards, the data is transfered using WebSocket protocol, we&#39;ll see its structure (&quot;frames&quot;) soon. And that&#39;s not HTTP at all.

### Extensions and subprotocols

There may be additional headers `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` and `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` that describe extensions and subprotocols.

For instance:

- `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame` means that the browser supports data compression. An extension is something related to transferring the data, functionality that extends WebSocket protocol. The header `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` is sent automatically by the browser, with the list of all extensions it supports.

- `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap, wamp` means that we&#39;d like to transfer not just any data, but the data in [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) or WAMP (&quot;The WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol&quot;) protocols. WebSocket subprotocols are registered in the [IANA catalogue](http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml). So, this header describes data formats that we&#39;re going to use.

  This optional header is set using the second parameter of `new WebSocket`. That&#39;s the array of subprotocols, e.g. if we&#39;d like to use SOAP or WAMP:

  ```js
  let socket = new WebSocket(&quot;wss://javascript.info/chat&quot;, [&quot;soap&quot;, &quot;wamp&quot;]);
  ```

The server should respond with a list of protocols and extensions that it agrees to use.

For example, the request:

```
GET /chat
Host: javascript.info
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: https://javascript.info
Sec-WebSocket-Key: Iv8io/9s+lYFgZWcXczP8Q==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
*!*
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap, wamp
*/!*
```

Response:

```
101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: hsBlbuDTkk24srzEOTBUlZAlC2g=
*!*
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap
*/!*
```

Here the server responds that it supports the extension &quot;deflate-frame&quot;, and only SOAP of the requested subprotocols.

## Data transfer

WebSocket communication consists of &quot;frames&quot; -- data fragments, that can be sent from either side, and can be of several kinds:

- &quot;text frames&quot; -- contain text data that parties send to each other.
- &quot;binary data frames&quot; -- contain binary data that parties send to each other.
- &quot;ping/pong frames&quot; are used to check the connection, sent from the server, the browser responds to these automatically.
- there&#39;s also &quot;connection close frame&quot; and a few other service frames.

In the browser, we directly work only with text or binary frames.

**WebSocket `.send()` method can send either text or binary data.**

A call `socket.send(body)` allows `body` in string or a binary format, including `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, etc. No settings required: just send it out in any format.

**When we receive the data, text always comes as string. And for binary data, we can choose between `Blob` and `ArrayBuffer` formats.**

That&#39;s set by `socket.binaryType` property, it&#39;s `&quot;blob&quot;` by default, so binary data comes as `Blob` objects.

[Blob](info:blob) is a high-level binary object, it directly integrates with `&lt;a&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;` and other tags, so that&#39;s a sane default. But for binary processing, to access individual data bytes, we can change it to `&quot;arraybuffer&quot;`:

```js
socket.binaryType = &quot;arraybuffer&quot;;
socket.onmessage = (event) =&gt; {
  // event.data is either a string (if text) or arraybuffer (if binary)
};
```

## Rate limiting

Imagine, our app is generating a lot of data to send. But the user has a slow network connection, maybe on a mobile internet, outside of a city.

We can call `socket.send(data)` again and again. But the data will be buffered (stored) in memory and sent out only as fast as network speed allows.

The `socket.bufferedAmount` property stores how many bytes remain buffered at this moment, waiting to be sent over the network.

We can examine it to see whether the socket is actually available for transmission.

```js
// every 100ms examine the socket and send more data
// only if all the existing data was sent out
setInterval(() =&gt; {
  if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0) {
    socket.send(moreData());
  }
}, 100);
```

## Connection close

Normally, when a party wants to close the connection (both browser and server have equal rights), they send a &quot;connection close frame&quot; with a numeric code and a textual reason.

The method for that is:

```js
socket.close([code], [reason]);
```

- `code` is a special WebSocket closing code (optional)
- `reason` is a string that describes the reason of closing (optional)

Then the other party in `close` event handler gets the code and the reason, e.g.:

```js
// closing party:
socket.close(1000, &quot;Work complete&quot;);

// the other party
socket.onclose = (event) =&gt; {
  // event.code === 1000
  // event.reason === &quot;Work complete&quot;
  // event.wasClean === true (clean close)
};
```

Most common code values:

- `1000` -- the default, normal closure (used if no `code` supplied),
- `1006` -- no way to set such code manually, indicates that the connection was lost (no close frame).

There are other codes like:

- `1001` -- the party is going away, e.g. server is shutting down, or a browser leaves the page,
- `1009` -- the message is too big to process,
- `1011` -- unexpected error on server,
- ...and so on.

The full list can be found in [RFC6455, §7.4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1).

WebSocket codes are somewhat like HTTP codes, but different. In particular, any codes less than `1000` are reserved, there&#39;ll be an error if we try to set such a code.

```js
// in case connection is broken
socket.onclose = (event) =&gt; {
  // event.code === 1006
  // event.reason === &quot;&quot;
  // event.wasClean === false (no closing frame)
};
```

## Connection state

To get connection state, additionally there&#39;s `socket.readyState` property with values:

- **`0`** -- &quot;CONNECTING&quot;: the connection has not yet been established,
- **`1`** -- &quot;OPEN&quot;: communicating,
- **`2`** -- &quot;CLOSING&quot;: the connection is closing,
- **`3`** -- &quot;CLOSED&quot;: the connection is closed.

## Chat example

Let&#39;s review a chat example using browser WebSocket API and Node.js WebSocket module &lt;https://github.com/websockets/ws&gt;. We&#39;ll pay the main attention to the client side, but the server is also simple.

HTML: we need a `&lt;form&gt;` to send messages and a `&lt;div&gt;` for incoming messages:

```html
&lt;!-- message form --&gt;
&lt;form name=&quot;publish&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;message&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;!-- div with messages --&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;messages&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

From JavaScript we want three things:

1. Open the connection.
2. On form submission -- `socket.send(message)` for the message.
3. On incoming message -- append it to `div#messages`.

Here&#39;s the code:

```js
let socket = new WebSocket(&quot;wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/chat/ws&quot;);

// send message from the form
document.forms.publish.onsubmit = function () {
  let outgoingMessage = this.message.value;

  socket.send(outgoingMessage);
  return false;
};

// message received - show the message in div#messages
socket.onmessage = function (event) {
  let message = event.data;

  let messageElem = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
  messageElem.textContent = message;
  document.getElementById(&quot;messages&quot;).prepend(messageElem);
};
```

Server-side code is a little bit beyond our scope. Here we&#39;ll use Node.js, but you don&#39;t have to. Other platforms also have their means to work with WebSocket.

The server-side algorithm will be:

1. Create `clients = new Set()` -- a set of sockets.
2. For each accepted websocket, add it to the set `clients.add(socket)` and setup `message` event listener to get its messages.
3. When a message received: iterate over clients and send it to everyone.
4. When a connection is closed: `clients.delete(socket)`.

```js
const ws = new require(&quot;ws&quot;);
const wss = new ws.Server({ noServer: true });

const clients = new Set();

http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {
  // here we only handle websocket connections
  // in real project we&#39;d have some other code here to handle non-websocket requests
  wss.handleUpgrade(req, req.socket, Buffer.alloc(0), onSocketConnect);
});

function onSocketConnect(ws) {
  clients.add(ws);

  ws.on(&quot;message&quot;, function (message) {
    message = message.slice(0, 50); // max message length will be 50

    for (let client of clients) {
      client.send(message);
    }
  });

  ws.on(&quot;close&quot;, function () {
    clients.delete(ws);
  });
}
```

Here&#39;s the working example:

[iframe src=&quot;chat&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; zip]

You can also download it (upper-right button in the iframe) and run locally. Just don&#39;t forget to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm install ws` before running.

## Summary

WebSocket is a modern way to have persistent browser-server connections.

- WebSockets don&#39;t have cross-origin limitations.
- They are well-supported in browsers.
- Can send/receive strings and binary data.

The API is simple.

Methods:

- `socket.send(data)`,
- `socket.close([code], [reason])`.

Events:

- `open`,
- `message`,
- `error`,
- `close`.

WebSocket by itself does not include reconnection, authentication and many other high-level mechanisms. So there are client/server libraries for that, and it&#39;s also possible to implement these capabilities manually.

Sometimes, to integrate WebSocket into existing project, people run WebSocket server in parallel with the main HTTP-server, and they share a single database. Requests to WebSocket use `wss://ws.site.com`, a subdomain that leads to WebSocket server, while `https://site.com` goes to the main HTTP-server.

Surely, other ways of integration are also possible.

# Server Sent Events

The [Server-Sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#the-eventsource-interface) specification describes a built-in class `EventSource`, that keeps connection with the server and allows to receive events from it.

Similar to `WebSocket`, the connection is persistent.

But there are several important differences:

| `WebSocket`                                                  | `EventSource`                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Bi-directional: both client and server can exchange messages | One-directional: only server sends data |
| Binary and text data                                         | Only text                               |
| WebSocket protocol                                           | Regular HTTP                            |

`EventSource` is a less-powerful way of communicating with the server than `WebSocket`.

Why should one ever use it?

The main reason: it&#39;s simpler. In many applications, the power of `WebSocket` is a little bit too much.

We need to receive a stream of data from server: maybe chat messages or market prices, or whatever. That&#39;s what `EventSource` is good at. Also it supports auto-reconnect, something we need to implement manually with `WebSocket`. Besides, it&#39;s a plain old HTTP, not a new protocol.

## Getting messages

To start receiving messages, we just need to create `new EventSource(url)`.

The browser will connect to `url` and keep the connection open, waiting for events.

The server should respond with status 200 and the header `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, then keep the connection and write messages into it in the special format, like this:

```
data: Message 1

data: Message 2

data: Message 3
data: of two lines
```

- A message text goes after `data:`, the space after the colon is optional.
- Messages are delimited with double line breaks `\n\n`.
- To send a line break `\n`, we can immediately send one more `data:` (3rd message above).

In practice, complex messages are usually sent JSON-encoded. Line-breaks are encoded as `\n` within them, so multiline `data:` messages are not necessary.

For instance:

```js
data: {&quot;user&quot;:&quot;John&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;First line*!*\n*/!* Second line&quot;}
```

...So we can assume that one `data:` holds exactly one message.

For each such message, the `message` event is generated:

```js
let eventSource = new EventSource(&quot;/events/subscribe&quot;);

eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log(&quot;New message&quot;, event.data);
  // will log 3 times for the data stream above
};

// or eventSource.addEventListener(&#39;message&#39;, ...)
```

### Cross-origin requests

`EventSource` supports cross-origin requests, like `fetch` and any other networking methods. We can use any URL:

```js
let source = new EventSource(&quot;https://another-site.com/events&quot;);
```

The remote server will get the `Origin` header and must respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to proceed.

To pass credentials, we should set the additional option `withCredentials`, like this:

```js
let source = new EventSource(&quot;https://another-site.com/events&quot;, {
  withCredentials: true,
});
```

Please see the chapter &lt;info:fetch-crossorigin&gt; for more details about cross-origin headers.

## Reconnection

Upon creation, `new EventSource` connects to the server, and if the connection is broken -- reconnects.

That&#39;s very convenient, as we don&#39;t have to care about it.

There&#39;s a small delay between reconnections, a few seconds by default.

The server can set the recommended delay using `retry:` in response (in milliseconds):

```js
retry: 15000
data: Hello, I set the reconnection delay to 15 seconds
```

The `retry:` may come both together with some data, or as a standalone message.

The browser should wait that many milliseconds before reconnecting. Or longer, e.g. if the browser knows (from OS) that there&#39;s no network connection at the moment, it may wait until the connection appears, and then retry.

- If the server wants the browser to stop reconnecting, it should respond with HTTP status 204.
- If the browser wants to close the connection, it should call `eventSource.close()`:

```js
let eventSource = new EventSource(...);

eventSource.close();
```

Also, there will be no reconnection if the response has an incorrect `Content-Type` or its HTTP status differs from 301, 307, 200 and 204. In such cases the `&quot;error&quot;` event will be emitted, and the browser won&#39;t reconnect.

```smart
When a connection is finally closed, there&#39;s no way to &quot;reopen&quot; it. If we&#39;d like to connect again, just create a new `EventSource`.
```

## Message id

When a connection breaks due to network problems, either side can&#39;t be sure which messages were received, and which weren&#39;t.

To correctly resume the connection, each message should have an `id` field, like this:

```
data: Message 1
id: 1

data: Message 2
id: 2

data: Message 3
data: of two lines
id: 3
```

When a message with `id:` is received, the browser:

- Sets the property `eventSource.lastEventId` to its value.
- Upon reconnection sends the header `Last-Event-ID` with that `id`, so that the server may re-send following messages.

```smart header=&quot;Put `id:`after`data:`&quot; Please note: the `id`is appended below message`data`by the server, to ensure that`lastEventId` is updated after the message is received.

````

## Connection status: readyState

The `EventSource` object has `readyState` property, that has one of three values:

```js no-beautify
EventSource.CONNECTING = 0; // connecting or reconnecting
EventSource.OPEN = 1;       // connected
EventSource.CLOSED = 2;     // connection closed
````

When an object is created, or the connection is down, it&#39;s always `EventSource.CONNECTING` (equals `0`).

We can query this property to know the state of `EventSource`.

## Event types

By default `EventSource` object generates three events:

- `message` -- a message received, available as `event.data`.
- `open` -- the connection is open.
- `error` -- the connection could not be established, e.g. the server returned HTTP 500 status.

The server may specify another type of event with `event: ...` at the event start.

For example:

```
event: join
data: Bob

data: Hello

event: leave
data: Bob
```

To handle custom events, we must use `addEventListener`, not `onmessage`:

```js
eventSource.addEventListener(&quot;join&quot;, (event) =&gt; {
  alert(`Joined ${event.data}`);
});

eventSource.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, (event) =&gt; {
  alert(`Said: ${event.data}`);
});

eventSource.addEventListener(&quot;leave&quot;, (event) =&gt; {
  alert(`Left ${event.data}`);
});
```

## Full example

Here&#39;s the server that sends messages with `1`, `2`, `3`, then `bye` and breaks the connection.

Then the browser automatically reconnects.

[codetabs src=&quot;eventsource&quot;]

## Summary

`EventSource` object automatically establishes a persistent connection and allows the server to send messages over it.

It offers:

- Automatic reconnect, with tunable `retry` timeout.
- Message ids to resume events, the last received identifier is sent in `Last-Event-ID` header upon reconnection.
- The current state is in the `readyState` property.

That makes `EventSource` a viable alternative to `WebSocket`, as the latter is more low-level and lacks such built-in features (though they can be implemented).

In many real-life applications, the power of `EventSource` is just enough.

Supported in all modern browsers (not IE).

The syntax is:

```js
let source = new EventSource(url, [credentials]);
```

The second argument has only one possible option: `{ withCredentials: true }`, it allows sending cross-origin credentials.

Overall cross-origin security is same as for `fetch` and other network methods.

### Properties of an `EventSource` object

`readyState`
: The current connection state: either `EventSource.CONNECTING (=0)`, `EventSource.OPEN (=1)` or `EventSource.CLOSED (=2)`.

`lastEventId`
: The last received `id`. Upon reconnection the browser sends it in the header `Last-Event-ID`.

### Methods

`close()`
: Closes the connection.

### Events

`message`
: Message received, the data is in `event.data`.

`open`
: The connection is established.

`error`
: In case of an error, including both lost connection (will auto-reconnect) and fatal errors. We can check `readyState` to see if the reconnection is being attempted.

The server may set a custom event name in `event:`. Such events should be handled using `addEventListener`, not `on&lt;event&gt;`.

### Server response format

The server sends messages, delimited by `\n\n`.

A message may have following fields:

- `data:` -- message body, a sequence of multiple `data` is interpreted as a single message, with `\n` between the parts.
- `id:` -- renews `lastEventId`, sent in `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect.
- `retry:` -- recommends a retry delay for reconnections in ms. There&#39;s no way to set it from JavaScript.
- `event:` -- event name, must precede `data:`.

A message may include one or more fields in any order, but `id:` usually goes the last.

# Cookies, document.cookie

Cookies are small strings of data that are stored directly in the browser. They are a part of the HTTP protocol, defined by the [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) specification.

Cookies are usually set by a web-server using the response `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header. Then, the browser automatically adds them to (almost) every request to the same domain using the `Cookie` HTTP-header.

One of the most widespread use cases is authentication:

1. Upon sign in, the server uses the `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header in the response to set a cookie with a unique &quot;session identifier&quot;.
2. Next time when the request is sent to the same domain, the browser sends the cookie over the net using the `Cookie` HTTP-header.
3. So the server knows who made the request.

We can also access cookies from the browser, using `document.cookie` property.

There are many tricky things about cookies and their options. In this chapter we&#39;ll cover them in detail.

## Reading from document.cookie

```online
Does your browser store any cookies from this site? Let&#39;s see:
```

```offline
Assuming you&#39;re on a website, it&#39;s possible to see the cookies from it, like this:
```

```js run
// At javascript.info, we use Google Analytics for statistics,
// so there should be some cookies
alert(document.cookie); // cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2;...
```

The value of `document.cookie` consists of `name=value` pairs, delimited by `; `. Each one is a separate cookie.

To find a particular cookie, we can split `document.cookie` by `; `, and then find the right name. We can use either a regular expression or array functions to do that.

We leave it as an exercise for the reader. Also, at the end of the chapter you&#39;ll find helper functions to manipulate cookies.

## Writing to document.cookie

We can write to `document.cookie`. But it&#39;s not a data property, it&#39;s an accessor (getter/setter). An assignment to it is treated specially.

**A write operation to `document.cookie` updates only cookies mentioned in it, but doesn&#39;t touch other cookies.**

For instance, this call sets a cookie with the name `user` and value `John`:

```js run
document.cookie = &quot;user=John&quot;; // update only cookie named &#39;user&#39;
alert(document.cookie); // show all cookies
```

If you run it, then probably you&#39;ll see multiple cookies. That&#39;s because the `document.cookie=` operation does not overwrite all cookies. It only sets the mentioned cookie `user`.

Technically, name and value can have any characters. To keep the valid formatting, they should be escaped using a built-in `encodeURIComponent` function:

```js run
// special characters (spaces), need encoding
let name = &quot;my name&quot;;
let value = &quot;John Smith&quot;;

// encodes the cookie as my%20name=John%20Smith
document.cookie = encodeURIComponent(name) + &quot;=&quot; + encodeURIComponent(value);

alert(document.cookie); // ...; my%20name=John%20Smith
```

```warn header=&quot;Limitations&quot;
There are few limitations:
- The `name=value` pair, after `encodeURIComponent`, should not exceed 4KB. So we can&#39;t store anything huge in a cookie.
- The total number of cookies per domain is limited to around 20+, the exact limit depends on the browser.
```

Cookies have several options, many of them are important and should be set.

The options are listed after `key=value`, delimited by `;`, like this:

```js run
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; path=/; expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT&quot;;
```

## path

- **`path=/mypath`**

The url path prefix must be absolute. It makes the cookie accessible for pages under that path. By default, it&#39;s the current path.

If a cookie is set with `path=/admin`, it&#39;s visible at pages `/admin` and `/admin/something`, but not at `/home` or `/adminpage`.

Usually, we should set `path` to the root: `path=/` to make the cookie accessible from all website pages.

## domain

- **`domain=site.com`**

A domain defines where the cookie is accessible. In practice though, there are limitations. We can&#39;t set any domain.

By default, a cookie is accessible only at the domain that set it. So, if the cookie was set by `site.com`, we won&#39;t get it at `other.com`.

...But what&#39;s more tricky, we also won&#39;t get the cookie at a subdomain `forum.site.com`!

```js
// at site.com
document.cookie = &quot;user=John&quot;;

// at forum.site.com
alert(document.cookie); // no user
```

**There&#39;s no way to let a cookie be accessible from another 2nd-level domain, so `other.com` will never receive a cookie set at `site.com`.**

It&#39;s a safety restriction, to allow us to store sensitive data in cookies, that should be available only on one site.

...But if we&#39;d like to allow subdomains like `forum.site.com` to get a cookie, that&#39;s possible. When setting a cookie at `site.com`, we should explicitly set the `domain` option to the root domain: `domain=site.com`:

```js
// at site.com
// make the cookie accessible on any subdomain *.site.com:
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; domain=site.com&quot;;

// later

// at forum.site.com
alert(document.cookie); // has cookie user=John
```

For historical reasons, `domain=.site.com` (a dot before `site.com`) also works the same way, allowing access to the cookie from subdomains. That&#39;s an old notation and should be used if we need to support very old browsers.

So, the `domain` option allows to make a cookie accessible at subdomains.

## expires, max-age

By default, if a cookie doesn&#39;t have one of these options, it disappears when the browser is closed. Such cookies are called &quot;session cookies&quot;

To let cookies survive a browser close, we can set either the `expires` or `max-age` option.

- **`expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT`**

The cookie expiration date defines the time, when the browser will automatically delete it.

The date must be exactly in this format, in the GMT timezone. We can use `date.toUTCString` to get it. For instance, we can set the cookie to expire in 1 day:

```js
// +1 day from now
let date = new Date(Date.now() + 86400e3);
date = date.toUTCString();
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; expires=&quot; + date;
```

If we set `expires` to a date in the past, the cookie is deleted.

- **`max-age=3600`**

Is an alternative to `expires` and specifies the cookie&#39;s expiration in seconds from the current moment.

If set to zero or a negative value, the cookie is deleted:

```js
// cookie will die in +1 hour from now
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; max-age=3600&quot;;

// delete cookie (let it expire right now)
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; max-age=0&quot;;
```

## secure

- **`secure`**

The cookie should be transferred only over HTTPS.

**By default, if we set a cookie at `http://site.com`, then it also appears at `https://site.com` and vice versa.**

That is, cookies are domain-based, they do not distinguish between the protocols.

With this option, if a cookie is set by `https://site.com`, then it doesn&#39;t appear when the same site is accessed by HTTP, as `http://site.com`. So if a cookie has sensitive content that should never be sent over unencrypted HTTP, the `secure` flag is the right thing.

```js
// assuming we&#39;re on https:// now
// set the cookie to be secure (only accessible over HTTPS)
document.cookie = &quot;user=John; secure&quot;;
```

## samesite

That&#39;s another security attribute `samesite`. It&#39;s designed to protect from so-called XSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks.

To understand how it works and when it&#39;s useful, let&#39;s take a look at XSRF attacks.

### XSRF attack

Imagine, you are logged into the site `bank.com`. That is: you have an authentication cookie from that site. Your browser sends it to `bank.com` with every request, so that it recognizes you and performs all sensitive financial operations.

Now, while browsing the web in another window, you accidentally come to another site `evil.com`. That site has JavaScript code that submits a form `&lt;form action=&quot;https://bank.com/pay&quot;&gt;` to `bank.com` with fields that initiate a transaction to the hacker&#39;s account.

The browser sends cookies every time you visit the site `bank.com`, even if the form was submitted from `evil.com`. So the bank recognizes you and actually performs the payment.

![](cookie-xsrf.svg)

That&#39;s a so-called &quot;Cross-Site Request Forgery&quot; (in short, XSRF) attack.

Real banks are protected from it of course. All forms generated by `bank.com` have a special field, a so-called &quot;XSRF protection token&quot;, that an evil page can&#39;t generate or extract from a remote page. It can submit a form there, but can&#39;t get the data back. The site `bank.com` checks for such token in every form it receives.

Such a protection takes time to implement though. We need to ensure that every form has the required token field, and we must also check all requests.

### Enter cookie samesite option

The cookie `samesite` option provides another way to protect from such attacks, that (in theory) should not require &quot;xsrf protection tokens&quot;.

It has two possible values:

- **`samesite=strict` (same as `samesite` without value)**

A cookie with `samesite=strict` is never sent if the user comes from outside the same site.

In other words, whether a user follows a link from their mail or submits a form from `evil.com`, or does any operation that originates from another domain, the cookie is not sent.

If authentication cookies have the `samesite` option, then a XSRF attack has no chances to succeed, because a submission from `evil.com` comes without cookies. So `bank.com` will not recognize the user and will not proceed with the payment.

The protection is quite reliable. Only operations that come from `bank.com` will send the `samesite` cookie, e.g. a form submission from another page at `bank.com`.

Although, there&#39;s a small inconvenience.

When a user follows a legitimate link to `bank.com`, like from their own notes, they&#39;ll be surprised that `bank.com` does not recognize them. Indeed, `samesite=strict` cookies are not sent in that case.

We could work around that by using two cookies: one for &quot;general recognition&quot;, only for the purposes of saying: &quot;Hello, John&quot;, and the other one for data-changing operations with `samesite=strict`. Then, a person coming from outside of the site will see a welcome, but payments must be initiated from the bank&#39;s website, for the second cookie to be sent.

- **`samesite=lax`**

A more relaxed approach that also protects from XSRF and doesn&#39;t break the user experience.

Lax mode, just like `strict`, forbids the browser to send cookies when coming from outside the site, but adds an exception.

A `samesite=lax` cookie is sent if both of these conditions are true:

1. The HTTP method is &quot;safe&quot; (e.g. GET, but not POST).

   The full list of safe HTTP methods is in the [RFC7231 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231). Basically, these are the methods that should be used for reading, but not writing the data. They must not perform any data-changing operations. Following a link is always GET, the safe method.

2. The operation performs a top-level navigation (changes URL in the browser address bar).

   That&#39;s usually true, but if the navigation is performed in an `&lt;iframe&gt;`, then it&#39;s not top-level. Also, JavaScript methods for network requests do not perform any navigation, hence they don&#39;t fit.

So, what `samesite=lax` does, is to basically allow the most common &quot;go to URL&quot; operation to have cookies. E.g. opening a website link from notes that satisfy these conditions.

But anything more complicated, like a network request from another site or a form submission, loses cookies.

If that&#39;s fine for you, then adding `samesite=lax` will probably not break the user experience and add protection.

Overall, `samesite` is a great option, but it has an important drawback:

- `samesite` is ignored (not supported) by old browsers, year 2017 or so.

**So if we solely rely on `samesite` to provide protection, then old browsers will be vulnerable.**

But we surely can use `samesite` together with other protection measures, like xsrf tokens, to add an additional layer of defence and then, in the future, when old browsers die out, we&#39;ll probably be able to drop xsrf tokens.

## httpOnly

This option has nothing to do with JavaScript, but we have to mention it for completeness.

The web-server uses the `Set-Cookie` header to set a cookie. Also, it may set the `httpOnly` option.

This option forbids any JavaScript access to the cookie. We can&#39;t see such a cookie or manipulate it using `document.cookie`.

That&#39;s used as a precaution measure, to protect from certain attacks when a hacker injects his own JavaScript code into a page and waits for a user to visit that page. That shouldn&#39;t be possible at all, hackers should not be able to inject their code into our site, but there may be bugs that let them do it.

Normally, if such a thing happens, and a user visits a web-page with hacker&#39;s JavaScript code, then that code executes and gains access to `document.cookie` with user cookies containing authentication information. That&#39;s bad.

But if a cookie is `httpOnly`, then `document.cookie` doesn&#39;t see it, so it is protected.

## Appendix: Cookie functions

Here&#39;s a small set of functions to work with cookies, more convenient than a manual modification of `document.cookie`.

There exist many cookie libraries for that, so these are for demo purposes. Fully working though.

### getCookie(name)

The shortest way to access a cookie is to use a [regular expression](info:regular-expressions).

The function `getCookie(name)` returns the cookie with the given `name`:

```js
// returns the cookie with the given name,
// or undefined if not found
function getCookie(name) {
  let matches = document.cookie.match(
    new RegExp(
      &quot;(?:^|; )&quot; +
        name.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g, &quot;\\$1&quot;) +
        &quot;=([^;]*)&quot;
    )
  );
  return matches ? decodeURIComponent(matches[1]) : undefined;
}
```

Here `new RegExp` is generated dynamically, to match `; name=&lt;value&gt;`.

Please note that a cookie value is encoded, so `getCookie` uses a built-in `decodeURIComponent` function to decode it.

### setCookie(name, value, options)

Sets the cookie&#39;s `name` to the given `value` with `path=/` by default (can be modified to add other defaults):

```js run
function setCookie(name, value, options = {}) {
  options = {
    path: &quot;/&quot;,
    // add other defaults here if necessary
    ...options,
  };

  if (options.expires instanceof Date) {
    options.expires = options.expires.toUTCString();
  }

  let updatedCookie =
    encodeURIComponent(name) + &quot;=&quot; + encodeURIComponent(value);

  for (let optionKey in options) {
    updatedCookie += &quot;; &quot; + optionKey;
    let optionValue = options[optionKey];
    if (optionValue !== true) {
      updatedCookie += &quot;=&quot; + optionValue;
    }
  }

  document.cookie = updatedCookie;
}

// Example of use:
setCookie(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, { secure: true, &quot;max-age&quot;: 3600 });
```

### deleteCookie(name)

To delete a cookie, we can call it with a negative expiration date:

```js
function deleteCookie(name) {
  setCookie(name, &quot;&quot;, {
    &quot;max-age&quot;: -1,
  });
}
```

```warn header=&quot;Updating or deleting must use same path and domain&quot;
Please note: when we update or delete a cookie, we should use exactly the same path and domain options as when we set it.
```

Together: [cookie.js](cookie.js).

## Appendix: Third-party cookies

A cookie is called &quot;third-party&quot; if it&#39;s placed by a domain other than the page the user is visiting.

For instance:

1. A page at `site.com` loads a banner from another site: `&lt;img src=&quot;https://ads.com/banner.png&quot;&gt;`.
2. Along with the banner, the remote server at `ads.com` may set the `Set-Cookie` header with a cookie like `id=1234`. Such a cookie originates from the `ads.com` domain, and will only be visible at `ads.com`:

   ![](cookie-third-party.svg)

3. Next time when `ads.com` is accessed, the remote server gets the `id` cookie and recognizes the user:

   ![](cookie-third-party-2.svg)

4. What&#39;s even more important is, when the user moves from `site.com` to another site `other.com`, which also has a banner, then `ads.com` gets the cookie, as it belongs to `ads.com`, thus recognizing the visitor and tracking him as he moves between sites:

   ![](cookie-third-party-3.svg)

Third-party cookies are traditionally used for tracking and ads services, due to their nature. They are bound to the originating domain, so `ads.com` can track the same user between different sites, if they all access it.

Naturally, some people don&#39;t like being tracked, so browsers allow to disable such cookies.

Also, some modern browsers employ special policies for such cookies:

- Safari does not allow third-party cookies at all.
- Firefox comes with a &quot;black list&quot; of third-party domains where it blocks third-party cookies.

```smart
If we load a script from a third-party domain, like `&lt;script src=&quot;https://google-analytics.com/analytics.js&quot;&gt;`, and that script uses `document.cookie` to set a cookie, then such cookie is not third-party.

If a script sets a cookie, then no matter where the script came from -- the cookie belongs to the domain of the current webpage.
```

## Appendix: GDPR

This topic is not related to JavaScript at all, just something to keep in mind when setting cookies.

There&#39;s a legislation in Europe called GDPR, that enforces a set of rules for websites to respect the users&#39; privacy. One of these rules is to require an explicit permission for tracking cookies from the user.

Please note, that&#39;s only about tracking/identifying/authorizing cookies.

So, if we set a cookie that just saves some information, but neither tracks nor identifies the user, then we are free to do it.

But if we are going to set a cookie with an authentication session or a tracking id, then a user must allow that.

Websites generally have two variants of following GDPR. You must have seen them both already in the web:

1. If a website wants to set tracking cookies only for authenticated users.

   To do so, the registration form should have a checkbox like &quot;accept the privacy policy&quot; (that describes how cookies are used), the user must check it, and then the website is free to set auth cookies.

2. If a website wants to set tracking cookies for everyone.

   To do so legally, a website shows a modal &quot;splash screen&quot; for newcomers, and requires them to agree to the cookies. Then the website can set them and let people see the content. That can be disturbing for new visitors though. No one likes to see such &quot;must-click&quot; modal splash screens instead of the content. But GDPR requires an explicit agreement.

GDPR is not only about cookies, it&#39;s about other privacy-related issues too, but that&#39;s too much beyond our scope.

## Summary

`document.cookie` provides access to cookies

- write operations modify only cookies mentioned in it.
- name/value must be encoded.
- one cookie must not exceed 4KB, 20+ cookies per site (depends on the browser).

Cookie options:

- `path=/`, by default current path, makes the cookie visible only under that path.
- `domain=site.com`, by default a cookie is visible on the current domain only. If the domain is set explicitly, the cookie becomes visible on subdomains.
- `expires` or `max-age` sets the cookie expiration time. Without them the cookie dies when the browser is closed.
- `secure` makes the cookie HTTPS-only.
- `samesite` forbids the browser to send the cookie with requests coming from outside the site. This helps to prevent XSRF attacks.

Additionally:

- Third-party cookies may be forbidden by the browser, e.g. Safari does that by default.
- When setting a tracking cookie for EU citizens, GDPR requires to ask for permission.

# LocalStorage, sessionStorage

Web storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.

What&#39;s interesting about them is that the data survives a page refresh (for `sessionStorage`) and even a full browser restart (for `localStorage`). We&#39;ll see that very soon.

We already have cookies. Why additional objects?

- Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most browsers allow at least 2 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.
- Also unlike cookies, the server can&#39;t manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything&#39;s done in JavaScript.
- The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can&#39;t access data from each other.

Both storage objects provide same methods and properties:

- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.
- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.
- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.
- `clear()` -- delete everything.
- `key(index)` -- get the key on a given position.
- `length` -- the number of stored items.

As you can see, it&#39;s like a `Map` collection (`setItem/getItem/removeItem`), but also allows access by index with `key(index)`.

Let&#39;s see how it works.

## localStorage demo

The main features of `localStorage` are:

- Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
- The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

For instance, if you run this code...

```js run
localStorage.setItem(&quot;test&quot;, 1);
```

...And close/open the browser or just open the same page in a different window, then you can get it like this:

```js run
alert(localStorage.getItem(&quot;test&quot;)); // 1
```

We only have to be on the same origin (domain/port/protocol), the url path can be different.

The `localStorage` is shared between all windows with the same origin, so if we set the data in one window, the change becomes visible in another one.

## Object-like access

We can also use a plain object way of getting/setting keys, like this:

```js run
// set key
localStorage.test = 2;

// get key
alert(localStorage.test); // 2

// remove key
delete localStorage.test;
```

That&#39;s allowed for historical reasons, and mostly works, but generally not recommended, because:

1. If the key is user-generated, it can be anything, like `length` or `toString`, or another built-in method of `localStorage`. In that case `getItem/setItem` work fine, while object-like access fails:

   ```js run
   let key = &quot;length&quot;;
   localStorage[key] = 5; // Error, can&#39;t assign length
   ```

2. There&#39;s a `storage` event, it triggers when we modify the data. That event does not happen for object-like access. We&#39;ll see that later in this chapter.

## Looping over keys

As we&#39;ve seen, the methods provide &quot;get/set/remove by key&quot; functionality. But how to get all saved values or keys?

Unfortunately, storage objects are not iterable.

One way is to loop over them as over an array:

```js run
for (let i = 0; i &lt; localStorage.length; i++) {
  let key = localStorage.key(i);
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
```

Another way is to use `for key in localStorage` loop, just as we do with regular objects.

It iterates over keys, but also outputs few built-in fields that we don&#39;t need:

```js run
// bad try
for (let key in localStorage) {
  alert(key); // shows getItem, setItem and other built-in stuff
}
```

...So we need either to filter fields from the prototype with `hasOwnProperty` check:

```js run
for (let key in localStorage) {
  if (!localStorage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    continue; // skip keys like &quot;setItem&quot;, &quot;getItem&quot; etc
  }
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
```

...Or just get the &quot;own&quot; keys with `Object.keys` and then loop over them if needed:

```js run
let keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for (let key of keys) {
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
```

The latter works, because `Object.keys` only returns the keys that belong to the object, ignoring the prototype.

## Strings only

Please note that both key and value must be strings.

If were any other type, like a number, or an object, it gets converted to string automatically:

```js run
sessionStorage.user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };
alert(sessionStorage.user); // [object Object]
```

We can use `JSON` to store objects though:

```js run
sessionStorage.user = JSON.stringify({ name: &quot;John&quot; });

// sometime later
let user = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.user);
alert(user.name); // John
```

Also it is possible to stringify the whole storage object, e.g. for debugging purposes:

```js run
// added formatting options to JSON.stringify to make the object look nicer
alert(JSON.stringify(localStorage, null, 2));
```

## sessionStorage

The `sessionStorage` object is used much less often than `localStorage`.

Properties and methods are the same, but it&#39;s much more limited:

- The `sessionStorage` exists only within the current browser tab.
  - Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
  - But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
- The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

Let&#39;s see that in action.

Run this code...

```js run
sessionStorage.setItem(&quot;test&quot;, 1);
```

...Then refresh the page. Now you can still get the data:

```js run
alert(sessionStorage.getItem(&quot;test&quot;)); // after refresh: 1
```

...But if you open the same page in another tab, and try again there, the code above returns `null`, meaning &quot;nothing found&quot;.

That&#39;s exactly because `sessionStorage` is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab. For that reason, `sessionStorage` is used sparingly.

## Storage event

When the data gets updated in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, [storage](https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-event) event triggers, with properties:

- `key` – the key that was changed (`null` if `.clear()` is called).
- `oldValue` – the old value (`null` if the key is newly added).
- `newValue` – the new value (`null` if the key is removed).
- `url` – the url of the document where the update happened.
- `storageArea` – either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` object where the update happened.

The important thing is: the event triggers on all `window` objects where the storage is accessible, except the one that caused it.

Let&#39;s elaborate.

Imagine, you have two windows with the same site in each. So `localStorage` is shared between them.

```online
You might want to open this page in two browser windows to test the code below.
```

If both windows are listening for `window.onstorage`, then each one will react on updates that happened in the other one.

```js run
// triggers on updates made to the same storage from other documents
window.onstorage = (event) =&gt; {
  // same as window.addEventListener(&#39;storage&#39;, event =&gt; {
  if (event.key != &quot;now&quot;) return;
  alert(event.key + &quot;:&quot; + event.newValue + &quot; at &quot; + event.url);
};

localStorage.setItem(&quot;now&quot;, Date.now());
```

Please note that the event also contains: `event.url` -- the url of the document where the data was updated.

Also, `event.storageArea` contains the storage object -- the event is the same for both `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`, so `event.storageArea` references the one that was modified. We may even want to set something back in it, to &quot;respond&quot; to a change.

**That allows different windows from the same origin to exchange messages.**

Modern browsers also support [Broadcast channel API](mdn:/api/Broadcast_Channel_API), the special API for same-origin inter-window communication, it&#39;s more full featured, but less supported. There are libraries that polyfill that API, based on `localStorage`, that make it available everywhere.

## Summary

Web storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to store key/value in the browser.

- Both `key` and `value` must be strings.
- The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser.
- They do not expire.
- The data is bound to the origin (domain/port/protocol).

| `localStorage`                                           | `sessionStorage`                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin | Visible within a browser tab, including iframes from the same origin |
| Survives browser restart                                 | Survives page refresh (but not tab close)                            |

API:

- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.
- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.
- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.
- `clear()` -- delete everything.
- `key(index)` -- get the key number `index`.
- `length` -- the number of stored items.
- Use `Object.keys` to get all keys.
- We access keys as object properties, in that case `storage` event isn&#39;t triggered.

Storage event:

- Triggers on `setItem`, `removeItem`, `clear` calls.
- Contains all the data about the operation (`key/oldValue/newValue`), the document `url` and the storage object `storageArea`.
- Triggers on all `window` objects that have access to the storage except the one that generated it (within a tab for `sessionStorage`, globally for `localStorage`).

# IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a database that is built into browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.

- Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.
- Supports transactions for reliability.
- Supports key range queries, indexes.
- Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.

That power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.

The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification &lt;https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB&gt;, is event-based.

We can also use `async/await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like &lt;https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb&gt;. That&#39;s pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can&#39;t replace events for all cases. So we&#39;ll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we&#39;ll use the wrapper.

```smart header=&quot;Where&#39;s the data?&quot;
Technically, the data is usually stored in the visitor&#39;s home directory, along with browser settings, extensions, etc.

Different browsers and OS-level users have each their own independant storage.
```

## Open database

To start working with IndexedDB, we first need to `open` (connect to) a database.

The syntax:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(name, version);
```

- `name` -- a string, the database name.
- `version` -- a positive integer version, by default `1` (explained below).

We can have many databases with different names, but all of them exist within the current origin (domain/protocol/port). Different websites can&#39;t access each other&#39;s databases.

The call returns `openRequest` object, we should listen to events on it:

- `success`: database is ready, there&#39;s the &quot;database object&quot; in `openRequest.result`, we should use it for further calls.
- `error`: opening failed.
- `upgradeneeded`: database is ready, but its version is outdated (see below).

**IndexedDB has a built-in mechanism of &quot;schema versioning&quot;, absent in server-side databases.**

Unlike server-side databases, IndexedDB is client-side, the data is stored in the browser, so we, developers, don&#39;t have full-time access to it. So, when we have published a new version of our app, and the user visits our webpage, we may need to update the database.

If the local database version is less than specified in `open`, then a special event `upgradeneeded` is triggered, and we can compare versions and upgrade data structures as needed.

The `upgradeneeded` event also triggers when the database doesn&#39;t yet exist (technically, it&#39;s version is `0`), so we can perform the initialization.

Let&#39;s say we published the first version of our app.

Then we can open the database with version `1` and perform the initialization in an `upgradeneeded` handler like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(&quot;store&quot;, *!*1*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error(&quot;Error&quot;, openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```

Then, later, we publish the 2nd version.

We can open it with version `2` and perform the upgrade like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(&quot;store&quot;, *!*2*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  // the existing database version is less than 2 (or it doesn&#39;t exist)
  let db = openRequest.result;
  switch(event.oldVersion) { // existing db version
    case 0:
      // version 0 means that the client had no database
      // perform initialization
    case 1:
      // client had version 1
      // update
  }
};
```

Please note: as our current version is `2`, the `onupgradeneeded` handler has a code branch for version `0`, suitable for users that are accessing for the first time and have no database, and also for version `1`, for upgrades.

And then, only if `onupgradeneeded` handler finishes without errors, `openRequest.onsuccess` triggers, and the database is considered successfully opened.

To delete a database:

```js
let deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(name);
// deleteRequest.onsuccess/onerror tracks the result
```

```warn header=&quot;We can&#39;t open an older version of the database&quot;
If the current user database has a higher version than in the `open` call, e.g. the existing DB version is `3`, and we try to `open(...2)`, then that&#39;s an error, `openRequest.onerror` triggers.

That&#39;s rare, but such a thing may happen when a visitor loads outdated JavaScript code, e.g. from a proxy cache. So the code is old, but his database is new.

To protect from errors, we should check `db.version` and suggest a page reload. Use proper HTTP caching headers to avoid loading the old code, so that you&#39;ll never have such problems.
```

### Parallel update problem

As we&#39;re talking about versioning, let&#39;s tackle a small related problem.

Let&#39;s say:

1. A visitor opened our site in a browser tab, with database version `1`.
2. Then we rolled out an update, so our code is newer.
3. And then the same visitor opens our site in another tab.

So there&#39;s a tab with an open connection to DB version `1`, while the second one attempts to update it to version `2` in its `upgradeneeded` handler.

The problem is that a database is shared between two tabs, as it&#39;s the same site, same origin. And it can&#39;t be both version `1` and `2`. To perform the update to version `2`, all connections to version 1 must be closed, including the one in the first tab.

In order to organize that, the `versionchange` event triggers on the &quot;outdated&quot; database object. We should listen for it and close the old database connection (and probably suggest a page reload, to load the updated code).

If we don&#39;t listen for the `versionchange` event and don&#39;t close the old connection, then the second, new connection won&#39;t be made. The `openRequest` object will emit the `blocked` event instead of `success`. So the second tab won&#39;t work.

Here&#39;s the code to correctly handle the parallel upgrade. It installs the `onversionchange` handler, that triggers if the current database connection becomes outdated (db version is updated elsewhere) and closes the connection.

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(&quot;store&quot;, 2);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = ...;
openRequest.onerror = ...;

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;

  *!*
  db.onversionchange = function() {
    db.close();
    alert(&quot;Database is outdated, please reload the page.&quot;)
  };
  */!*

  // ...the db is ready, use it...
};

*!*
openRequest.onblocked = function() {
  // this event shouldn&#39;t trigger if we handle onversionchange correctly

  // it means that there&#39;s another open connection to the same database
  // and it wasn&#39;t closed after db.onversionchange triggered for it
};
*/!*
```

...In other words, here we do two things:

1. The `db.onversionchange` listener informs us about a parallel update attempt, if the current database version becomes outdated.
2. The `openRequest.onblocked` listener informs us about the opposite situation: there&#39;s a connection to an outdated version elsewhere, and it doesn&#39;t close, so the newer connection can&#39;t be made.

We can handle things more gracefully in `db.onversionchange`, prompt the visitor to save the data before the connection is closed and so on.

Or, an alternative approach would be to not close the database in `db.onversionchange`, but instead use the `onblocked` handler (in the new tab) to alert the visitor, tell him that the newer version can&#39;t be loaded until they close other tabs.

These update collisions happen rarely, but we should at least have some handling for them, at least an `onblocked` handler, to prevent our script from dying silently.

## Object store

To store something in IndexedDB, we need an _object store_.

An object store is a core concept of IndexedDB. Counterparts in other databases are called &quot;tables&quot; or &quot;collections&quot;. It&#39;s where the data is stored. A database may have multiple stores: one for users, another one for goods, etc.

Despite being named an &quot;object store&quot;, primitives can be stored too.

**We can store almost any value, including complex objects.**

IndexedDB uses the [standard serialization algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/infrastructure.html#section-structuredserializeforstorage) to clone-and-store an object. It&#39;s like `JSON.stringify`, but more powerful, capable of storing much more datatypes.

An example of an object that can&#39;t be stored: an object with circular references. Such objects are not serializable. `JSON.stringify` also fails for such objects.

**There must be a unique `key` for every value in the store.**

A key must be one of these types - number, date, string, binary, or array. It&#39;s a unique identifier, so we can search/remove/update values by the key.

![](indexeddb-structure.svg)

As we&#39;ll see very soon, we can provide a key when we add a value to the store, similar to `localStorage`. But when we store objects, IndexedDB allows setting up an object property as the key, which is much more convenient. Or we can auto-generate keys.

But we need to create an object store first.

The syntax to create an object store:

```js
db.createObjectStore(name[, keyOptions]);
```

Please note, the operation is synchronous, no `await` needed.

- `name` is the store name, e.g. `&quot;books&quot;` for books,
- `keyOptions` is an optional object with one of two properties:
  - `keyPath` -- a path to an object property that IndexedDB will use as the key, e.g. `id`.
  - `autoIncrement` -- if `true`, then the key for a newly stored object is generated automatically, as an ever-incrementing number.

If we don&#39;t supply `keyOptions`, then we&#39;ll need to provide a key explicitly later, when storing an object.

For instance, this object store uses `id` property as the key:

```js
db.createObjectStore(&quot;books&quot;, { keyPath: &quot;id&quot; });
```

**An object store can only be created/modified while updating the DB version, in `upgradeneeded` handler.**

That&#39;s a technical limitation. Outside of the handler we&#39;ll be able to add/remove/update the data, but object stores can only be created/removed/altered during a version update.

To perform a database version upgrade, there are two main approaches:

1. We can implement per-version upgrade functions: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4 etc. Then, in `upgradeneeded` we can compare versions (e.g. old 2, now 4) and run per-version upgrades step by step, for every intermediate version (2 to 3, then 3 to 4).
2. Or we can just examine the database: get a list of existing object stores as `db.objectStoreNames`. That object is a [DOMStringList](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#domstringlist) that provides `contains(name)` method to check for existance. And then we can do updates depending on what exists and what doesn&#39;t.

For small databases the second variant may be simpler.

Here&#39;s the demo of the second approach:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(&quot;db&quot;, 2);

// create/upgrade the database without version checks
openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function () {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains(&quot;books&quot;)) {
    // if there&#39;s no &quot;books&quot; store
    db.createObjectStore(&quot;books&quot;, { keyPath: &quot;id&quot; }); // create it
  }
};
```

To delete an object store:

```js
db.deleteObjectStore(&quot;books&quot;);
```

## Transactions

The term &quot;transaction&quot; is generic, used in many kinds of databases.

A transaction is a group of operations, that should either all succeed or all fail.

For instance, when a person buys something, we need to:

1. Subtract the money from their account.
2. Add the item to their inventory.

It would be pretty bad if we complete the 1st operation, and then something goes wrong, e.g. lights out, and we fail to do the 2nd. Both should either succeed (purchase complete, good!) or both fail (at least the person kept their money, so they can retry).

Transactions can guarantee that.

**All data operations must be made within a transaction in IndexedDB.**

To start a transaction:

```js
db.transaction(store[, type]);
```

- `store` is a store name that the transaction is going to access, e.g. `&quot;books&quot;`. Can be an array of store names if we&#39;re going to access multiple stores.
- `type` – a transaction type, one of:
  - `readonly` -- can only read, the default.
  - `readwrite` -- can only read and write the data, but not create/remove/alter object stores.

There&#39;s also `versionchange` transaction type: such transactions can do everything, but we can&#39;t create them manually. IndexedDB automatically creates a `versionchange` transaction when opening the database, for `updateneeded` handler. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a single place where we can update the database structure, create/remove object stores.

```smart header=&quot;Why are there different types of transactions?&quot;
Performance is the reason why transactions need to be labeled either `readonly` and `readwrite`.

Many `readonly` transactions are able to access the same store concurrently, but `readwrite` transactions can&#39;t. A `readwrite` transaction &quot;locks&quot; the store for writing. The next transaction must wait before the previous one finishes before accessing the same store.
```

After the transaction is created, we can add an item to the store, like this:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;books&quot;, &quot;readwrite&quot;); // (1)

// get an object store to operate on it
*!*
let books = transaction.objectStore(&quot;books&quot;); // (2)
*/!*

let book = {
  id: &#39;js&#39;,
  price: 10,
  created: new Date()
};

*!*
let request = books.add(book); // (3)
*/!*

request.onsuccess = function() { // (4)
  console.log(&quot;Book added to the store&quot;, request.result);
};

request.onerror = function() {
  console.log(&quot;Error&quot;, request.error);
};
```

There were basically four steps:

1. Create a transaction, mentioning all the stores it&#39;s going to access, at `(1)`.
2. Get the store object using `transaction.objectStore(name)`, at `(2)`.
3. Perform the request to the object store `books.add(book)`, at `(3)`.
4. ...Handle request success/error `(4)`, then we can make other requests if needed, etc.

Object stores support two methods to store a value:

- **put(value, [key])**
  Add the `value` to the store. The `key` is supplied only if the object store did not have `keyPath` or `autoIncrement` option. If there&#39;s already a value with the same key, it will be replaced.

- **add(value, [key])**
  Same as `put`, but if there&#39;s already a value with the same key, then the request fails, and an error with the name `&quot;ConstraintError&quot;` is generated.

Similar to opening a database, we can send a request: `books.add(book)`, and then wait for `success/error` events.

- The `request.result` for `add` is the key of the new object.
- The error is in `request.error` (if any).

## Transactions&#39; autocommit

In the example above we started the transaction and made `add` request. But as we stated previously, a transaction may have multiple associated requests, that must either all succeed or all fail. How do we mark the transaction as finished, with no more requests to come?

The short answer is: we don&#39;t.

In the next version 3.0 of the specification, there will probably be a manual way to finish the transaction, but right now in 2.0 there isn&#39;t.

**When all transaction requests are finished, and the [microtasks queue](info:microtask-queue) is empty, it is committed automatically.**

Usually, we can assume that a transaction commits when all its requests are complete, and the current code finishes.

So, in the example above no special call is needed to finish the transaction.

Transactions auto-commit principle has an important side effect. We can&#39;t insert an async operation like `fetch`, `setTimeout` in the middle of a transaction. IndexedDB will not keep the transaction waiting till these are done.

In the code below, `request2` in the line `(*)` fails, because the transaction is already committed, and can&#39;t make any request in it:

```js
let request1 = books.add(book);

request1.onsuccess = function() {
  fetch(&#39;/&#39;).then(response =&gt; {
*!*
    let request2 = books.add(anotherBook); // (*)
*/!*
    request2.onerror = function() {
      console.log(request2.error.name); // TransactionInactiveError
    };
  });
};
```

That&#39;s because `fetch` is an asynchronous operation, a macrotask. Transactions are closed before the browser starts doing macrotasks.

Authors of IndexedDB spec believe that transactions should be short-lived. Mostly for performance reasons.

Notably, `readwrite` transactions &quot;lock&quot; the stores for writing. So if one part of the application initiated `readwrite` on `books` object store, then another part that wants to do the same has to wait: the new transaction &quot;hangs&quot; till the first one is done. That can lead to strange delays if transactions take a long time.

So, what to do?

In the example above we could make a new `db.transaction` right before the new request `(*)`.

But it will be even better, if we&#39;d like to keep the operations together, in one transaction, to split apart IndexedDB transactions and &quot;other&quot; async stuff.

First, make `fetch`, prepare the data if needed, afterwards create a transaction and perform all the database requests, it&#39;ll work then.

To detect the moment of successful completion, we can listen to `transaction.oncomplete` event:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;books&quot;, &quot;readwrite&quot;);

// ...perform operations...

transaction.oncomplete = function () {
  console.log(&quot;Transaction is complete&quot;);
};
```

Only `complete` guarantees that the transaction is saved as a whole. Individual requests may succeed, but the final write operation may go wrong (e.g. I/O error or something).

To manually abort the transaction, call:

```js
transaction.abort();
```

That cancels all modification made by the requests in it and triggers `transaction.onabort` event.

## Error handling

Write requests may fail.

That&#39;s to be expected, not only because of possible errors at our side, but also for reasons not related to the transaction itself. For instance, the storage quota may be exceeded. So we must be ready to handle such case.

**A failed request automatically aborts the transaction, canceling all its changes.**

In some situations, we may want to handle the failure (e.g. try another request), without canceling existing changes, and continue the transaction. That&#39;s possible. The `request.onerror` handler is able to prevent the transaction abort by calling `event.preventDefault()`.

In the example below a new book is added with the same key (`id`) as the existing one. The `store.add` method generates a `&quot;ConstraintError&quot;` in that case. We handle it without canceling the transaction:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;books&quot;, &quot;readwrite&quot;);

let book = { id: &quot;js&quot;, price: 10 };

let request = transaction.objectStore(&quot;books&quot;).add(book);

request.onerror = function (event) {
  // ConstraintError occurs when an object with the same id already exists
  if (request.error.name == &quot;ConstraintError&quot;) {
    console.log(&quot;Book with such id already exists&quot;); // handle the error
    event.preventDefault(); // don&#39;t abort the transaction
    // use another key for the book?
  } else {
    // unexpected error, can&#39;t handle it
    // the transaction will abort
  }
};

transaction.onabort = function () {
  console.log(&quot;Error&quot;, transaction.error);
};
```

### Event delegation

Do we need onerror/onsuccess for every request? Not every time. We can use event delegation instead.

**IndexedDB events bubble: `request` -&gt; `transaction` -&gt; `database`.**

All events are DOM events, with capturing and bubbling, but usually only bubbling stage is used.

So we can catch all errors using `db.onerror` handler, for reporting or other purposes:

```js
db.onerror = function (event) {
  let request = event.target; // the request that caused the error

  console.log(&quot;Error&quot;, request.error);
};
```

...But what if an error is fully handled? We don&#39;t want to report it in that case.

We can stop the bubbling and hence `db.onerror` by using `event.stopPropagation()` in `request.onerror`.

```js
request.onerror = function (event) {
  if (request.error.name == &quot;ConstraintError&quot;) {
    console.log(&quot;Book with such id already exists&quot;); // handle the error
    event.preventDefault(); // don&#39;t abort the transaction
    event.stopPropagation(); // don&#39;t bubble error up, &quot;chew&quot; it
  } else {
    // do nothing
    // transaction will be aborted
    // we can take care of error in transaction.onabort
  }
};
```

## Searching

There are two main types of search in an object store:

1. By a key value or a key range. In our &quot;books&quot; storage that would be a value or range of values of `book.id`.
2. By another object field, e.g. `book.price`. This required an additional data structure, named &quot;index&quot;.

### By key

First let&#39;s deal with the first type of search: by key.

Searching methods support both exact key values and so-called &quot;ranges of values&quot; -- [IDBKeyRange](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#keyrange) objects that specify an acceptable &quot;key range&quot;.

`IDBKeyRange` objects are created using following calls:

- `IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(lower, [open])` means: `≥lower` (or `&gt;lower` if `open` is true)
- `IDBKeyRange.upperBound(upper, [open])` means: `≤upper` (or `&lt;upper` if `open` is true)
- `IDBKeyRange.bound(lower, upper, [lowerOpen], [upperOpen])` means: between `lower` and `upper`. If the open flags is true, the corresponding key is not included in the range.
- `IDBKeyRange.only(key)` -- a range that consists of only one `key`, rarely used.

We&#39;ll see practical examples of using them very soon.

To perform the actual search, there are following methods. They accept a `query` argument that can be either an exact key or a key range:

- `store.get(query)` -- search for the first value by a key or a range.
- `store.getAll([query], [count])` -- search for all values, limit by `count` if given.
- `store.getKey(query)` -- search for the first key that satisfies the query, usually a range.
- `store.getAllKeys([query], [count])` -- search for all keys that satisfy the query, usually a range, up to `count` if given.
- `store.count([query])` -- get the total count of keys that satisfy the query, usually a range.

For instance, we have a lot of books in our store. Remember, the `id` field is the key, so all these methods can search by `id`.

Request examples:

```js
// get one book
books.get(&quot;js&quot;);

// get books with &#39;css&#39; &lt;= id &lt;= &#39;html&#39;
books.getAll(IDBKeyRange.bound(&quot;css&quot;, &quot;html&quot;));

// get books with id &lt; &#39;html&#39;
books.getAll(IDBKeyRange.upperBound(&quot;html&quot;, true));

// get all books
books.getAll();

// get all keys, where id &gt; &#39;js&#39;
books.getAllKeys(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(&quot;js&quot;, true));
```

```smart header=&quot;Object store is always sorted&quot;
An object store sorts values by key internally.

So requests that return many values always return them in sorted by key order.
```

### By a field using an index

To search by other object fields, we need to create an additional data structure named &quot;index&quot;.

An index is an &quot;add-on&quot; to the store that tracks a given object field. For each value of that field, it stores a list of keys for objects that have that value. There will be a more detailed picture below.

The syntax:

```js
objectStore.createIndex(name, keyPath, [options]);
```

- **`name`** -- index name,
- **`keyPath`** -- path to the object field that the index should track (we&#39;re going to search by that field),
- **`option`** -- an optional object with properties:
  - **`unique`** -- if true, then there may be only one object in the store with the given value at the `keyPath`. The index will enforce that by generating an error if we try to add a duplicate.
  - **`multiEntry`** -- only used if the value on `keyPath` is an array. In that case, by default, the index will treat the whole array as the key. But if `multiEntry` is true, then the index will keep a list of store objects for each value in that array. So array members become index keys.

In our example, we store books keyed by `id`.

Let&#39;s say we want to search by `price`.

First, we need to create an index. It must be done in `upgradeneeded`, just like an object store:

```js
openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // we must create the index here, in versionchange transaction
  let books = db.createObjectStore(&#39;books&#39;, {keyPath: &#39;id&#39;});
*!*
  let index = books.createIndex(&#39;price_idx&#39;, &#39;price&#39;);
*/!*
};
```

- The index will track `price` field.
- The price is not unique, there may be multiple books with the same price, so we don&#39;t set `unique` option.
- The price is not an array, so `multiEntry` flag is not applicable.

Imagine that our `inventory` has 4 books. Here&#39;s the picture that shows exactly what the `index` is:

![](indexeddb-index.svg)

As said, the index for each value of `price` (second argument) keeps the list of keys that have that price.

The index keeps itself up to date automatically, we don&#39;t have to care about it.

Now, when we want to search for a given price, we simply apply the same search methods to the index:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;books&quot;); // readonly
let books = transaction.objectStore(&quot;books&quot;);
let priceIndex = books.index(&quot;price_idx&quot;);

*!*
let request = priceIndex.getAll(10);
*/!*

request.onsuccess = function() {
  if (request.result !== undefined) {
    console.log(&quot;Books&quot;, request.result); // array of books with price=10
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;No such books&quot;);
  }
};
```

We can also use `IDBKeyRange` to create ranges and looks for cheap/expensive books:

```js
// find books where price &lt;= 5
let request = priceIndex.getAll(IDBKeyRange.upperBound(5));
```

Indexes are internally sorted by the tracked object field, `price` in our case. So when we do the search, the results are also sorted by `price`.

## Deleting from store

The `delete` method looks up values to delete by a query, the call format is similar to `getAll`:

- **`delete(query)`** -- delete matching values by query.

For instance:

```js
// delete the book with id=&#39;js&#39;
books.delete(&quot;js&quot;);
```

If we&#39;d like to delete books based on a price or another object field, then we should first find the key in the index, and then call `delete`:

```js
// find the key where price = 5
let request = priceIndex.getKey(5);

request.onsuccess = function () {
  let id = request.result;
  let deleteRequest = books.delete(id);
};
```

To delete everything:

```js
books.clear(); // clear the storage.
```

## Cursors

Methods like `getAll/getAllKeys` return an array of keys/values.

But an object storage can be huge, bigger than the available memory. Then `getAll` will fail to get all records as an array.

What to do?

Cursors provide the means to work around that.

**A _cursor_ is a special object that traverses the object storage, given a query, and returns one key/value at a time, thus saving memory.**

As an object store is sorted internally by key, a cursor walks the store in key order (ascending by default).

The syntax:

```js
// like getAll, but with a cursor:
let request = store.openCursor(query, [direction]);

// to get keys, not values (like getAllKeys): store.openKeyCursor
```

- **`query`** is a key or a key range, same as for `getAll`.
- **`direction`** is an optional argument, which order to use:
  - `&quot;next&quot;` -- the default, the cursor walks up from the record with the lowest key.
  - `&quot;prev&quot;` -- the reverse order: down from the record with the biggest key.
  - `&quot;nextunique&quot;`, `&quot;prevunique&quot;` -- same as above, but skip records with the same key (only for cursors over indexes, e.g. for multiple books with price=5 only the first one will be returned).

**The main difference of the cursor is that `request.onsuccess` triggers multiple times: once for each result.**

Here&#39;s an example of how to use a cursor:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;books&quot;);
let books = transaction.objectStore(&quot;books&quot;);

let request = books.openCursor();

// called for each book found by the cursor
request.onsuccess = function () {
  let cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    let key = cursor.key; // book key (id field)
    let value = cursor.value; // book object
    console.log(key, value);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;No more books&quot;);
  }
};
```

The main cursor methods are:

- `advance(count)` -- advance the cursor `count` times, skipping values.
- `continue([key])` -- advance the cursor to the next value in range matching (or immediately after `key` if given).

Whether there are more values matching the cursor or not -- `onsuccess` gets called, and then in `result` we can get the cursor pointing to the next record, or `undefined`.

In the example above the cursor was made for the object store.

But we also can make a cursor over an index. As we remember, indexes allow to search by an object field. Cursors over indexes do precisely the same as over object stores -- they save memory by returning one value at a time.

For cursors over indexes, `cursor.key` is the index key (e.g. price), and we should use `cursor.primaryKey` property for the object key:

```js
let request = priceIdx.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.upperBound(5));

// called for each record
request.onsuccess = function () {
  let cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    let primaryKey = cursor.primaryKey; // next object store key (id field)
    let value = cursor.value; // next object store object (book object)
    let key = cursor.key; // next index key (price)
    console.log(key, value);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;No more books&quot;);
  }
};
```

## Promise wrapper

Adding `onsuccess/onerror` to every request is quite a cumbersome task. Sometimes we can make our life easier by using event delegation, e.g. set handlers on the whole transactions, but `async/await` is much more convenient.

Let&#39;s use a thin promise wrapper &lt;https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb&gt; further in this chapter. It creates a global `idb` object with [promisified](info:promisify) IndexedDB methods.

Then, instead of `onsuccess/onerror` we can write like this:

```js
let db = await idb.openDB(&#39;store&#39;, 1, db =&gt; {
  if (db.oldVersion == 0) {
    // perform the initialization
    db.createObjectStore(&#39;books&#39;, {keyPath: &#39;id&#39;});
  }
});

let transaction = db.transaction(&#39;books&#39;, &#39;readwrite&#39;);
let books = transaction.objectStore(&#39;books&#39;);

try {
  await books.add(...);
  await books.add(...);

  await transaction.complete;

  console.log(&#39;jsbook saved&#39;);
} catch(err) {
  console.log(&#39;error&#39;, err.message);
}

```

So we have all the sweet &quot;plain async code&quot; and &quot;try..catch&quot; stuff.

### Error handling

If we don&#39;t catch an error, then it falls through, till the closest outer `try..catch`.

An uncaught error becomes an &quot;unhandled promise rejection&quot; event on `window` object.

We can handle such errors like this:

```js
window.addEventListener(&#39;unhandledrejection&#39;, event =&gt; {
  let request = event.target; // IndexedDB native request object
  let error = event.reason; //  Unhandled error object, same as request.error
  ...report about the error...
});
```

### &quot;Inactive transaction&quot; pitfall

As we already know, a transaction auto-commits as soon as the browser is done with the current code and microtasks. So if we put a _macrotask_ like `fetch` in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction won&#39;t wait for it to finish. It just auto-commits. So the next request in it would fail.

For a promise wrapper and `async/await` the situation is the same.

Here&#39;s an example of `fetch` in the middle of the transaction:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(&quot;inventory&quot;, &quot;readwrite&quot;);
let inventory = transaction.objectStore(&quot;inventory&quot;);

await inventory.add({ id: &#39;js&#39;, price: 10, created: new Date() });

await fetch(...); // (*)

await inventory.add({ id: &#39;js&#39;, price: 10, created: new Date() }); // Error
```

The next `inventory.add` after `fetch` `(*)` fails with an &quot;inactive transaction&quot; error, because the transaction is already committed and closed at that time.

The workaround is the same as when working with native IndexedDB: either make a new transaction or just split things apart.

1. Prepare the data and fetch all that&#39;s needed first.
2. Then save in the database.

### Getting native objects

Internally, the wrapper performs a native IndexedDB request, adding `onerror/onsuccess` to it, and returns a promise that rejects/resolves with the result.

That works fine most of the time. The examples are at the lib page &lt;https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb&gt;.

In few rare cases, when we need the original `request` object, we can access it as `promise.request` property of the promise:

```js
let promise = books.add(book); // get a promise (don&#39;t await for its result)

let request = promise.request; // native request object
let transaction = request.transaction; // native transaction object

// ...do some native IndexedDB voodoo...

let result = await promise; // if still needed
```

## Summary

IndexedDB can be thought of as a &quot;localStorage on steroids&quot;. It&#39;s a simple key-value database, powerful enough for offline apps, yet simple to use.

The best manual is the specification, [the current one](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB-2/) is 2.0, but few methods from [3.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) (it&#39;s not much different) are partially supported.

The basic usage can be described with a few phrases:

1. Get a promise wrapper like [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb).
2. Open a database: `idb.openDb(name, version, onupgradeneeded)`
   - Create object storages and indexes in `onupgradeneeded` handler or perform version update if needed.
3. For requests:
   - Create transaction `db.transaction(&#39;books&#39;)` (readwrite if needed).
   - Get the object store `transaction.objectStore(&#39;books&#39;)`.
4. Then, to search by a key, call methods on the object store directly.
   - To search by an object field, create an index.
5. If the data does not fit in memory, use a cursor.

Here&#39;s a small demo app:

# Bezier curve

Bezier curves are used in computer graphics to draw shapes, for CSS animation and in many other places.

They are a very simple thing, worth to study once and then feel comfortable in the world of vector graphics and advanced animations.

## Control points

A [bezier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) is defined by control points.

There may be 2, 3, 4 or more.

For instance, two points curve:

![](bezier2.svg)

Three points curve:

![](bezier3.svg)

Four points curve:

![](bezier4.svg)

If you look closely at these curves, you can immediately notice:

1. **Points are not always on curve.** That&#39;s perfectly normal, later we&#39;ll see how the curve is built.
2. **The curve order equals the number of points minus one**.
   For two points we have a linear curve (that&#39;s a straight line), for three points -- quadratic curve (parabolic), for four points -- cubic curve.
3. **A curve is always inside the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of control points:**

   ![](bezier4-e.svg) ![](bezier3-e.svg)

Because of that last property, in computer graphics it&#39;s possible to optimize intersection tests. If convex hulls do not intersect, then curves do not either. So checking for the convex hulls intersection first can give a very fast &quot;no intersection&quot; result. Checking the intersection of convex hulls is much easier, because they are rectangles, triangles and so on (see the picture above), much simpler figures than the curve.

**The main value of Bezier curves for drawing -- by moving the points the curve is changing _in intuitively obvious way_.**

Try to move control points using a mouse in the example below:

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?nocpath=1&amp;p=0,0,0.5,0,0.5,1,1,1&quot; height=370]

**As you can notice, the curve stretches along the tangential lines 1 -&gt; 2 and 3 -&gt; 4.**

After some practice it becomes obvious how to place points to get the needed curve. And by connecting several curves we can get practically anything.

Here are some examples:

![](bezier-car.svg) ![](bezier-letter.svg) ![](bezier-vase.svg)

## De Casteljau&#39;s algorithm

There&#39;s a mathematical formula for Bezier curves, but let&#39;s cover it a bit later, because
[De Casteljau&#39;s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm) is identical to the mathematical definition and visually shows how it is constructed.

First let&#39;s see the 3-points example.

Here&#39;s the demo, and the explanation follow.

Control points (1,2 and 3) can be moved by the mouse. Press the &quot;play&quot; button to run it.

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,0.5,1,1,0&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

**De Casteljau&#39;s algorithm of building the 3-point bezier curve:**

1. Draw control points. In the demo above they are labeled: `1`, `2`, `3`.
2. Build segments between control points 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. In the demo above they are &lt;span style=&quot;color:#825E28&quot;&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt;.
3. The parameter `t` moves from `0` to `1`. In the example above the step `0.05` is used: the loop goes over `0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, ... 0.95, 1`.

   For each of these values of `t`:

   - On each &lt;span style=&quot;color:#825E28&quot;&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt; segment we take a point located on the distance proportional to `t` from its beginning. As there are two segments, we have two points.

     For instance, for `t=0` -- both points will be at the beginning of segments, and for `t=0.25` -- on the 25% of segment length from the beginning, for `t=0.5` -- 50%(the middle), for `t=1` -- in the end of segments.

   - Connect the points. On the picture below the connecting segment is painted &lt;span style=&quot;color:#167490&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;.

| For `t=0.25`           | For `t=0.5`            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ![](bezier3-draw1.svg) | ![](bezier3-draw2.svg) |

4. Now in the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#167490&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; segment take a point on the distance proportional to the same value of `t`. That is, for `t=0.25` (the left picture) we have a point at the end of the left quarter of the segment, and for `t=0.5` (the right picture) -- in the middle of the segment. On pictures above that point is &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;.

5. As `t` runs from `0` to `1`, every value of `t` adds a point to the curve. The set of such points forms the Bezier curve. It&#39;s red and parabolic on the pictures above.

That was a process for 3 points. But the same is for 4 points.

The demo for 4 points (points can be moved by a mouse):

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,0.5,0,0.5,1,1,1&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

The algorithm for 4 points:

- Connect control points by segments: 1 -&gt; 2, 2 -&gt; 3, 3 -&gt; 4. There will be 3 &lt;span style=&quot;color:#825E28&quot;&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt; segments.
- For each `t` in the interval from `0` to `1`:
  - We take points on these segments on the distance proportional to `t` from the beginning. These points are connected, so that we have two &lt;span style=&quot;color:#0A0&quot;&gt;green segments&lt;/span&gt;.
  - On these segments we take points proportional to `t`. We get one &lt;span style=&quot;color:#167490&quot;&gt;blue segment&lt;/span&gt;.
  - On the blue segment we take a point proportional to `t`. On the example above it&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;.
- These points together form the curve.

The algorithm is recursive and can be generalized for any number of control points.

Given N of control points:

1. We connect them to get initially N-1 segments.
2. Then for each `t` from `0` to `1`, we take a point on each segment on the distance proportional to `t` and connect them. There will be N-2 segments.
3. Repeat step 2 until there is only one point.

These points make the curve.

```online
**Run and pause examples to clearly see the segments and how the curve is built.**
```

A curve that looks like `y=1/t`:

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,0,0.75,0.25,1,1,1&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

Zig-zag control points also work fine:

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,0.5,1,1&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

Making a loop is possible:

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,1,0.5,0&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

A non-smooth Bezier curve (yeah, that&#39;s possible too):

[iframe src=&quot;demo.svg?p=0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0&amp;animate=1&quot; height=370]

```online
If there&#39;s something unclear in the algorithm description, please look at the live examples above to see how
the curve is built.
```

As the algorithm is recursive, we can build Bezier curves of any order, that is: using 5, 6 or more control points. But in practice many points are less useful. Usually we take 2-3 points, and for complex lines glue several curves together. That&#39;s simpler to develop and calculate.

```smart header=&quot;How to draw a curve *through* given points?&quot;
To specify a Bezier curve, control points are used. As we can see, they are not on the curve, except the first and the last ones.

Sometimes we have another task: to draw a curve *through several points*, so that all of them are on a single smooth curve. That task is called  [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation), and here we don&#39;t cover it.

There are mathematical formulas for such curves, for instance [Lagrange polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial). In computer graphics [spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) is often used to build smooth curves that connect many points.
```

## Maths

A Bezier curve can be described using a mathematical formula.

As we saw -- there&#39;s actually no need to know it, most people just draw the curve by moving points with a mouse. But if you&#39;re into maths -- here it is.

Given the coordinates of control points &lt;code&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: the first control point has coordinates &lt;code&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, the second: &lt;code&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, and so on, the curve coordinates are described by the equation that depends on the parameter `t` from the segment `[0,1]`.

- The formula for a 2-points curve:

  &lt;code&gt;P = (1-t)P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + tP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

- For 3 control points:

  &lt;code&gt;P = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2(1−t)tP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

- For 4 control points:

  &lt;code&gt;P = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 3(1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;tP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +3(1−t)t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

These are vector equations. In other words, we can put `x` and `y` instead of `P` to get corresponding coordinates.

For instance, the 3-point curve is formed by points `(x,y)` calculated as:

- &lt;code&gt;x = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2(1−t)tx&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
- &lt;code&gt;y = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2(1−t)ty&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Instead of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; we should put coordinates of 3 control points, and then as `t` moves from `0` to `1`, for each value of `t` we&#39;ll have `(x,y)` of the curve.

For instance, if control points are `(0,0)`, `(0.5, 1)` and `(1, 0)`, the equations become:

- &lt;code&gt;x = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; _ 0 + 2(1−t)t _ 0.5 + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; \* 1 = (1-t)t + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = t&lt;/code&gt;
- &lt;code&gt;y = (1−t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; _ 0 + 2(1−t)t _ 1 + t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; \* 0 = 2(1-t)t = –2t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2t&lt;/code&gt;

Now as `t` runs from `0` to `1`, the set of values `(x,y)` for each `t` forms the curve for such control points.

## Summary

Bezier curves are defined by their control points.

We saw two definitions of Bezier curves:

1. Using a drawing process: De Casteljau&#39;s algorithm.
2. Using a mathematical formulas.

Good properties of Bezier curves:

- We can draw smooth lines with a mouse by moving control points.
- Complex shapes can be made of several Bezier curves.

Usage:

- In computer graphics, modeling, vector graphic editors. Fonts are described by Bezier curves.
- In web development -- for graphics on Canvas and in the SVG format. By the way, &quot;live&quot; examples above are written in SVG. They are actually a single SVG document that is given different points as parameters. You can open it in a separate window and see the source: [demo.svg](demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,0.5,1,1&amp;animate=1).
- In CSS animation to describe the path and speed of animation.

# CSS-animations

CSS animations make it possible to do simple animations without JavaScript at all.

JavaScript can be used to control CSS animations and make them even better, with little code.

## CSS transitions [#css-transition]

The idea of CSS transitions is simple. We describe a property and how its changes should be animated. When the property changes, the browser paints the animation.

That is, all we need is to change the property, and the fluid transition will be done by the browser.

For instance, the CSS below animates changes of `background-color` for 3 seconds:

```css
.animated {
  transition-property: background-color;
  transition-duration: 3s;
}
```

Now if an element has `.animated` class, any change of `background-color` is animated during 3 seconds.

Click the button below to animate the background:

```html run autorun height=60
&lt;button id=&quot;color&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  #color {
    transition-property: background-color;
    transition-duration: 3s;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  color.onclick = function () {
    this.style.backgroundColor = &quot;red&quot;;
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

There are 4 properties to describe CSS transitions:

- `transition-property`
- `transition-duration`
- `transition-timing-function`
- `transition-delay`

We&#39;ll cover them in a moment, for now let&#39;s note that the common `transition` property allows declaring them together in the order: `property duration timing-function delay`, as well as animating multiple properties at once.

For instance, this button animates both `color` and `font-size`:

```html run height=80 autorun no-beautify
&lt;button id=&quot;growing&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  #growing {
  *!*
    transition: font-size 3s, color 2s;
  */!*
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  growing.onclick = function () {
    this.style.fontSize = &quot;36px&quot;;
    this.style.color = &quot;red&quot;;
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Now, let&#39;s cover animation properties one by one.

## transition-property

In `transition-property`, we write a list of properties to animate, for instance: `left`, `margin-left`, `height`, `color`. Or we could write `all`, which means &quot;animate all properties&quot;.

Do note that, there are properties which can not be animated. However, [most of the generally used properties are animatable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties).

## transition-duration

In `transition-duration` we can specify how long the animation should take. The time should be in [CSS time format](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#time): in seconds `s` or milliseconds `ms`.

## transition-delay

In `transition-delay` we can specify the delay _before_ the animation. For instance, if `transition-delay` is `1s` and `transition-duration` is `2s`, then the animation starts 1 second after the property change and the total duration will be 2 seconds.

Negative values are also possible. Then the animation is shown immediately, but the starting point of the animation will be after given value (time). For example, if `transition-delay` is `-1s` and `transition-duration` is `2s`, then animation starts from the halfway point and total duration will be 1 second.

Here the animation shifts numbers from `0` to `9` using CSS `translate` property:

[codetabs src=&quot;digits&quot;]

The `transform` property is animated like this:

```css
#stripe.animate {
  transform: translate(-90%);
  transition-property: transform;
  transition-duration: 9s;
}
```

In the example above JavaScript adds the class `.animate` to the element -- and the animation starts:

```js
stripe.classList.add(&quot;animate&quot;);
```

We could also start it from somewhere in the middle of the transition, from an exact number, e.g. corresponding to the current second, using a negative `transition-delay`.

Here if you click the digit -- it starts the animation from the current second:

[codetabs src=&quot;digits-negative-delay&quot;]

JavaScript does it with an extra line:

```js
stripe.onclick = function() {
  let sec = new Date().getSeconds() % 10;
*!*
  // for instance, -3s here starts the animation from the 3rd second
  stripe.style.transitionDelay = &#39;-&#39; + sec + &#39;s&#39;;
*/!*
  stripe.classList.add(&#39;animate&#39;);
};
```

## transition-timing-function

The timing function describes how the animation process is distributed along its timeline. Will it start slowly and then go fast, or vice versa.

It appears to be the most complicated property at first. But it becomes very simple if we devote a bit time to it.

That property accepts two kinds of values: a Bezier curve or steps. Let&#39;s start with the curve, as it&#39;s used more often.

### Bezier curve

The timing function can be set as a [Bezier curve](/bezier-curve) with 4 control points that satisfy the conditions:

1. First control point: `(0,0)`.
2. Last control point: `(1,1)`.
3. For intermediate points, the values of `x` must be in the interval `0..1`, `y` can be anything.

The syntax for a Bezier curve in CSS: `cubic-bezier(x2, y2, x3, y3)`. Here we need to specify only 2nd and 3rd control points, because the 1st one is fixed to `(0,0)` and the 4th one is `(1,1)`.

The timing function describes how fast the animation process goes.

- The `x` axis is the time: `0` -- the start, `1` -- the end of `transition-duration`.
- The `y` axis specifies the completion of the process: `0` -- the starting value of the property, `1` -- the final value.

The simplest variant is when the animation goes uniformly, with the same linear speed. That can be specified by the curve `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)`.

Here&#39;s how that curve looks:

![](bezier-linear.svg)

...As we can see, it&#39;s just a straight line. As the time (`x`) passes, the completion (`y`) of the animation steadily goes from `0` to `1`.

The train in the example below goes from left to right with the permanent speed (click it):

[codetabs src=&quot;train-linear&quot;]

The CSS `transition` is based on that curve:

```css
.train {
  left: 0;
  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1);
  /* JavaScript sets left to 450px */
}
```

...And how can we show a train slowing down?

We can use another Bezier curve: `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.5, 0.5 ,1.0)`.

The graph:

![](train-curve.svg)

As we can see, the process starts fast: the curve soars up high, and then slower and slower.

Here&#39;s the timing function in action (click the train):

[codetabs src=&quot;train&quot;]

CSS:

```css
.train {
  left: 0;
  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, 0.5, 0.5, 1);
  /* JavaScript sets left to 450px */
}
```

There are several built-in curves: `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out` and `ease-in-out`.

The `linear` is a shorthand for `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)` -- a straight line, which we described above.

Other names are shorthands for the following `cubic-bezier`:

| &lt;code&gt;ease&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;      | &lt;code&gt;ease-in&lt;/code&gt;             | &lt;code&gt;ease-out&lt;/code&gt;             | &lt;code&gt;ease-in-out&lt;/code&gt;                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| &lt;code&gt;(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)&lt;/code&gt; | &lt;code&gt;(0.42, 0, 1.0, 1.0)&lt;/code&gt; | &lt;code&gt;(0, 0, 0.58, 1.0)&lt;/code&gt;    | &lt;code&gt;(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1.0)&lt;/code&gt;       |
| ![ease, figure](ease.svg)           | ![ease-in, figure](ease-in.svg)  | ![ease-out, figure](ease-out.svg) | ![ease-in-out, figure](ease-in-out.svg) |

`*` -- by default, if there&#39;s no timing function, `ease` is used.

So we could use `ease-out` for our slowing down train:

```css
.train {
  left: 0;
  transition: left 5s ease-out;
  /* transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, .5, .5, 1); */
}
```

But it looks a bit differently.

**A Bezier curve can make the animation exceed its range.**

The control points on the curve can have any `y` coordinates: even negative or huge ones. Then the Bezier curve would also extend very low or high, making the animation go beyond its normal range.

In the example below the animation code is:

```css
.train {
  left: 100px;
  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0.5, -1, 0.5, 2);
  /* JavaScript sets left to 400px */
}
```

The property `left` should animate from `100px` to `400px`.

But if you click the train, you&#39;ll see that:

- First, the train goes _back_: `left` becomes less than `100px`.
- Then it goes forward, a little bit farther than `400px`.
- And then back again -- to `400px`.

[codetabs src=&quot;train-over&quot;]

Why it happens is pretty obvious if we look at the graph of the given Bezier curve:

![](bezier-train-over.svg)

We moved the `y` coordinate of the 2nd point below zero, and for the 3rd point we made it over `1`, so the curve goes out of the &quot;regular&quot; quadrant. The `y` is out of the &quot;standard&quot; range `0..1`.

As we know, `y` measures &quot;the completion of the animation process&quot;. The value `y = 0` corresponds to the starting property value and `y = 1` -- the ending value. So values `y&lt;0` move the property beyond the starting `left` and `y&gt;1` -- past the final `left`.

That&#39;s a &quot;soft&quot; variant for sure. If we put `y` values like `-99` and `99` then the train would jump out of the range much more.

But how do we make a Bezier curve for a specific task? There are many tools. For instance, we can do it on the site &lt;http://cubic-bezier.com/&gt;.

### Steps

The timing function `steps(number of steps[, start/end])` allows splitting an animation into steps.

Let&#39;s see that in an example with digits.

Here&#39;s a list of digits, without any animations, just as a source:

[codetabs src=&quot;step-list&quot;]

We&#39;ll make the digits appear in a discrete way by making the part of the list outside of the red &quot;window&quot; invisible and shifting the list to the left with each step.

There will be 9 steps, a step-move for each digit:

```css
#stripe.animate {
  transform: translate(-90%);
  transition: transform 9s * ! * steps(9, start) * / ! *;
}
```

In action:

[codetabs src=&quot;step&quot;]

The first argument of `steps(9, start)` is the number of steps. The transform will be split into 9 parts (10% each). The time interval is automatically divided into 9 parts as well, so `transition: 9s` gives us 9 seconds for the whole animation – 1 second per digit.

The second argument is one of two words: `start` or `end`.

The `start` means that in the beginning of animation we need to make the first step immediately.

We can observe that during the animation: when we click on the digit it changes to `1` (the first step) immediately, and then changes in the beginning of the next second.

The process is progressing like this:

- `0s` -- `-10%` (first change in the beginning of the 1st second, immediately)
- `1s` -- `-20%`
- ...
- `8s` -- `-80%`
- (the last second shows the final value).

The alternative value `end` would mean that the change should be applied not in the beginning, but at the end of each second.

So the process would go like this:

- `0s` -- `0`
- `1s` -- `-10%` (first change at the end of the 1st second)
- `2s` -- `-20%`
- ...
- `9s` -- `-90%`

Here&#39;s `steps(9, end)` in action (note the pause between the first digit change):

[codetabs src=&quot;step-end&quot;]

There are also shorthand values:

- `step-start` -- is the same as `steps(1, start)`. That is, the animation starts immediately and takes 1 step. So it starts and finishes immediately, as if there were no animation.
- `step-end` -- the same as `steps(1, end)`: make the animation in a single step at the end of `transition-duration`.

These values are rarely used, because that&#39;s not really animation, but rather a single-step change.

## Event transitionend

When the CSS animation finishes the `transitionend` event triggers.

It is widely used to do an action after the animation is done. Also we can join animations.

For instance, the ship in the example below starts to sail there and back when clicked, each time farther and farther to the right:

[iframe src=&quot;boat&quot; height=300 edit link]

The animation is initiated by the function `go` that re-runs each time the transition finishes, and flips the direction:

```js
boat.onclick = function () {
  //...
  let times = 1;

  function go() {
    if (times % 2) {
      // sail to the right
      boat.classList.remove(&quot;back&quot;);
      boat.style.marginLeft = 100 * times + 200 + &quot;px&quot;;
    } else {
      // sail to the left
      boat.classList.add(&quot;back&quot;);
      boat.style.marginLeft = 100 * times - 200 + &quot;px&quot;;
    }
  }

  go();

  boat.addEventListener(&quot;transitionend&quot;, function () {
    times++;
    go();
  });
};
```

The event object for `transitionend` has a few specific properties:

`event.propertyName`
: The property that has finished animating. Can be good if we animate multiple properties simultaneously.

`event.elapsedTime`
: The time (in seconds) that the animation took, without `transition-delay`.

## Keyframes

We can join multiple simple animations together using the `@keyframes` CSS rule.

It specifies the &quot;name&quot; of the animation and rules - what, when and where to animate. Then using the `animation` property, we can attach the animation to the element and specify additional parameters for it.

Here&#39;s an example with explanations:

```html run height=60 autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; no-beautify
&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  *!*
    @keyframes go-left-right {        /* give it a name: &quot;go-left-right&quot; */
      from { left: 0px; }             /* animate from left: 0px */
      to { left: calc(100% - 50px); } /* animate to left: 100%-50px */
    }
  */!*

    .progress {
  *!*
      animation: go-left-right 3s infinite alternate;
      /* apply the animation &quot;go-left-right&quot; to the element
         duration 3 seconds
         number of times: infinite
         alternate direction every time
      */
  */!*

      position: relative;
      border: 2px solid green;
      width: 50px;
      height: 20px;
      background: lime;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
```

There are many articles about `@keyframes` and a [detailed specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations/).

You probably won&#39;t need `@keyframes` often, unless everything is in constant motion on your sites.

## Summary

CSS animations allow smoothly (or not) animated changes of one or multiple CSS properties.

They are good for most animation tasks. We&#39;re also able to use JavaScript for animations, the next chapter is devoted to that.

Limitations of CSS animations compared to JavaScript animations:

```compare plus=&quot;CSS animations&quot; minus=&quot;JavaScript animations&quot;
+ Simple things done simply.
+ Fast and lightweight for CPU.
- JavaScript animations are flexible. They can implement any animation logic, like an &quot;explosion&quot; of an element.
- Not just property changes. We can create new elements in JavaScript as part of the animation.
```

The majority of animations can be implemented using CSS as described in this chapter. And the `transitionend` event allows JavaScript to be run after the animation, so it integrates fine with the code.

But in the next chapter we&#39;ll do some JavaScript animations to cover more complex cases.

# JavaScript animations

JavaScript animations can handle things that CSS can&#39;t.

For instance, moving along a complex path, with a timing function different from Bezier curves, or an animation on a canvas.

## Using setInterval

An animation can be implemented as a sequence of frames -- usually small changes to HTML/CSS properties.

For instance, changing `style.left` from `0px` to `100px` moves the element. And if we increase it in `setInterval`, changing by `2px` with a tiny delay, like 50 times per second, then it looks smooth. That&#39;s the same principle as in the cinema: 24 frames per second is enough to make it look smooth.

The pseudo-code can look like this:

```js
let timer = setInterval(function() {
  if (animation complete) clearInterval(timer);
  else increase style.left by 2px
}, 20); // change by 2px every 20ms, about 50 frames per second
```

More complete example of the animation:

```js
let start = Date.now(); // remember start time

let timer = setInterval(function () {
  // how much time passed from the start?
  let timePassed = Date.now() - start;

  if (timePassed &gt;= 2000) {
    clearInterval(timer); // finish the animation after 2 seconds
    return;
  }

  // draw the animation at the moment timePassed
  draw(timePassed);
}, 20);

// as timePassed goes from 0 to 2000
// left gets values from 0px to 400px
function draw(timePassed) {
  train.style.left = timePassed / 5 + &quot;px&quot;;
}
```

[codetabs height=200 src=&quot;move&quot;]

## Using requestAnimationFrame

Let&#39;s imagine we have several animations running simultaneously.

If we run them separately, then even though each one has `setInterval(..., 20)`, then the browser would have to repaint much more often than every `20ms`.

That&#39;s because they have different starting time, so &quot;every 20ms&quot; differs between different animations. The intervals are not aligned. So we&#39;ll have several independent runs within `20ms`.

In other words, this:

```js
setInterval(function () {
  animate1();
  animate2();
  animate3();
}, 20);
```

...Is lighter than three independent calls:

```js
setInterval(animate1, 20); // independent animations
setInterval(animate2, 20); // in different places of the script
setInterval(animate3, 20);
```

These several independent redraws should be grouped together, to make the redraw easier for the browser and hence load less CPU load and look smoother.

There&#39;s one more thing to keep in mind. Sometimes CPU is overloaded, or there are other reasons to redraw less often (like when the browser tab is hidden), so we really shouldn&#39;t run it every `20ms`.

But how do we know about that in JavaScript? There&#39;s a specification [Animation timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/) that provides the function `requestAnimationFrame`. It addresses all these issues and even more.

The syntax:

```js
let requestId = requestAnimationFrame(callback);
```

That schedules the `callback` function to run in the closest time when the browser wants to do animation.

If we do changes in elements in `callback` then they will be grouped together with other `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks and with CSS animations. So there will be one geometry recalculation and repaint instead of many.

The returned value `requestId` can be used to cancel the call:

```js
// cancel the scheduled execution of callback
cancelAnimationFrame(requestId);
```

The `callback` gets one argument -- the time passed from the beginning of the page load in microseconds. This time can also be obtained by calling [performance.now()](mdn:api/Performance/now).

Usually `callback` runs very soon, unless the CPU is overloaded or the laptop battery is almost discharged, or there&#39;s another reason.

The code below shows the time between first 10 runs for `requestAnimationFrame`. Usually it&#39;s 10-20ms:

```html run height=40 refresh
&lt;script&gt;
  let prev = performance.now();
  let times = 0;

  requestAnimationFrame(function measure(time) {
    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(
      &quot;beforeEnd&quot;,
      Math.floor(time - prev) + &quot; &quot;
    );
    prev = time;

    if (times++ &lt; 10) requestAnimationFrame(measure);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Structured animation

Now we can make a more universal animation function based on `requestAnimationFrame`:

```js
function animate({ timing, draw, duration }) {
  let start = performance.now();

  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {
    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1
    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;
    if (timeFraction &gt; 1) timeFraction = 1;

    // calculate the current animation state
    let progress = timing(timeFraction);

    draw(progress); // draw it

    if (timeFraction &lt; 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
  });
}
```

Function `animate` accepts 3 parameters that essentially describes the animation:

`duration`
: Total time of animation. Like, `1000`.

`timing(timeFraction)`
: Timing function, like CSS-property `transition-timing-function` that gets the fraction of time that passed (`0` at start, `1` at the end) and returns the animation completion (like `y` on the Bezier curve).

    For instance, a linear function means that the animation goes on uniformly with the same speed:

    ```js
    function linear(timeFraction) {
      return timeFraction;
    }
    ```

    It&#39;s graph:
    ![](linear.svg)

    That&#39;s just like `transition-timing-function: linear`. There are more interesting variants shown below.

`draw(progress)`
: The function that takes the animation completion state and draws it. The value `progress=0` denotes the beginning animation state, and `progress=1` -- the end state.

    This is that function that actually draws out the animation.

    It can move the element:
    ```js
    function draw(progress) {
      train.style.left = progress + &#39;px&#39;;
    }
    ```

    ...Or do anything else, we can animate anything, in any way.

Let&#39;s animate the element `width` from `0` to `100%` using our function.

Click on the element for the demo:

[codetabs height=60 src=&quot;width&quot;]

The code for it:

```js
animate({
  duration: 1000,
  timing(timeFraction) {
    return timeFraction;
  },
  draw(progress) {
    elem.style.width = progress * 100 + &quot;%&quot;;
  },
});
```

Unlike CSS animation, we can make any timing function and any drawing function here. The timing function is not limited by Bezier curves. And `draw` can go beyond properties, create new elements for like fireworks animation or something.

## Timing functions

We saw the simplest, linear timing function above.

Let&#39;s see more of them. We&#39;ll try movement animations with different timing functions to see how they work.

### Power of n

If we want to speed up the animation, we can use `progress` in the power `n`.

For instance, a parabolic curve:

```js
function quad(timeFraction) {
  return Math.pow(timeFraction, 2);
}
```

The graph:

![](quad.svg)

See in action (click to activate):

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;quad&quot; link]

...Or the cubic curve or even greater `n`. Increasing the power makes it speed up faster.

Here&#39;s the graph for `progress` in the power `5`:

![](quint.svg)

In action:

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;quint&quot; link]

### The arc

Function:

```js
function circ(timeFraction) {
  return 1 - Math.sin(Math.acos(timeFraction));
}
```

The graph:

![](circ.svg)

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;circ&quot; link]

### Back: bow shooting

This function does the &quot;bow shooting&quot;. First we &quot;pull the bowstring&quot;, and then &quot;shoot&quot;.

Unlike previous functions, it depends on an additional parameter `x`, the &quot;elasticity coefficient&quot;. The distance of &quot;bowstring pulling&quot; is defined by it.

The code:

```js
function back(x, timeFraction) {
  return Math.pow(timeFraction, 2) * ((x + 1) * timeFraction - x);
}
```

**The graph for `x = 1.5`:**

![](back.svg)

For animation we use it with a specific value of `x`. Example for `x = 1.5`:

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;back&quot; link]

### Bounce

Imagine we are dropping a ball. It falls down, then bounces back a few times and stops.

The `bounce` function does the same, but in the reverse order: &quot;bouncing&quot; starts immediately. It uses few special coefficients for that:

```js
function bounce(timeFraction) {
  for (let a = 0, b = 1, result; 1; a += b, b /= 2) {
    if (timeFraction &gt;= (7 - 4 * a) / 11) {
      return (
        -Math.pow((11 - 6 * a - 11 * timeFraction) / 4, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2)
      );
    }
  }
}
```

In action:

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;bounce&quot; link]

### Elastic animation

One more &quot;elastic&quot; function that accepts an additional parameter `x` for the &quot;initial range&quot;.

```js
function elastic(x, timeFraction) {
  return (
    Math.pow(2, 10 * (timeFraction - 1)) *
    Math.cos(((20 * Math.PI * x) / 3) * timeFraction)
  );
}
```

**The graph for `x=1.5`:**
![](elastic.svg)

In action for `x=1.5`:

[iframe height=40 src=&quot;elastic&quot; link]

## Reversal: ease\*

So we have a collection of timing functions. Their direct application is called &quot;easeIn&quot;.

Sometimes we need to show the animation in the reverse order. That&#39;s done with the &quot;easeOut&quot; transform.

### easeOut

In the &quot;easeOut&quot; mode the `timing` function is put into a wrapper `timingEaseOut`:

```js
timingEaseOut(timeFraction) = 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction)
```

In other words, we have a &quot;transform&quot; function `makeEaseOut` that takes a &quot;regular&quot; timing function and returns the wrapper around it:

```js
// accepts a timing function, returns the transformed variant
function makeEaseOut(timing) {
  return function (timeFraction) {
    return 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction);
  };
}
```

For instance, we can take the `bounce` function described above and apply it:

```js
let bounceEaseOut = makeEaseOut(bounce);
```

Then the bounce will be not in the beginning, but at the end of the animation. Looks even better:

[codetabs src=&quot;bounce-easeout&quot;]

Here we can see how the transform changes the behavior of the function:

![](bounce-inout.svg)

If there&#39;s an animation effect in the beginning, like bouncing -- it will be shown at the end.

In the graph above the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#EE6B47&quot;&gt;regular bounce&lt;/span&gt; has the red color, and the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#62C0DC&quot;&gt;easeOut bounce&lt;/span&gt; is blue.

- Regular bounce -- the object bounces at the bottom, then at the end sharply jumps to the top.
- After `easeOut` -- it first jumps to the top, then bounces there.

### easeInOut

We also can show the effect both in the beginning and the end of the animation. The transform is called &quot;easeInOut&quot;.

Given the timing function, we calculate the animation state like this:

```js
if (timeFraction &lt;= 0.5) {
  // first half of the animation
  return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;
} else {
  // second half of the animation
  return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;
}
```

The wrapper code:

```js
function makeEaseInOut(timing) {
  return function (timeFraction) {
    if (timeFraction &lt; 0.5) return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;
    else return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;
  };
}

bounceEaseInOut = makeEaseInOut(bounce);
```

In action, `bounceEaseInOut`:

[codetabs src=&quot;bounce-easeinout&quot;]

The &quot;easeInOut&quot; transform joins two graphs into one: `easeIn` (regular) for the first half of the animation and `easeOut` (reversed) -- for the second part.

The effect is clearly seen if we compare the graphs of `easeIn`, `easeOut` and `easeInOut` of the `circ` timing function:

![](circ-ease.svg)

- &lt;span style=&quot;color:#EE6B47&quot;&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; is the regular variant of `circ` (`easeIn`).
- &lt;span style=&quot;color:#8DB173&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; -- `easeOut`.
- &lt;span style=&quot;color:#62C0DC&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt; -- `easeInOut`.

As we can see, the graph of the first half of the animation is the scaled down `easeIn`, and the second half is the scaled down `easeOut`. As a result, the animation starts and finishes with the same effect.

## More interesting &quot;draw&quot;

Instead of moving the element we can do something else. All we need is to write the proper `draw`.

Here&#39;s the animated &quot;bouncing&quot; text typing:

[codetabs src=&quot;text&quot;]

## Summary

For animations that CSS can&#39;t handle well, or those that need tight control, JavaScript can help. JavaScript animations should be implemented via `requestAnimationFrame`. That built-in method allows to setup a callback function to run when the browser will be preparing a repaint. Usually that&#39;s very soon, but the exact time depends on the browser.

When a page is in the background, there are no repaints at all, so the callback won&#39;t run: the animation will be suspended and won&#39;t consume resources. That&#39;s great.

Here&#39;s the helper `animate` function to setup most animations:

```js
function animate({ timing, draw, duration }) {
  let start = performance.now();

  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {
    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1
    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;
    if (timeFraction &gt; 1) timeFraction = 1;

    // calculate the current animation state
    let progress = timing(timeFraction);

    draw(progress); // draw it

    if (timeFraction &lt; 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
  });
}
```

Options:

- `duration` -- the total animation time in ms.
- `timing` -- the function to calculate animation progress. Gets a time fraction from 0 to 1, returns the animation progress, usually from 0 to 1.
- `draw` -- the function to draw the animation.

Surely we could improve it, add more bells and whistles, but JavaScript animations are not applied on a daily basis. They are used to do something interesting and non-standard. So you&#39;d want to add the features that you need when you need them.

JavaScript animations can use any timing function. We covered a lot of examples and transformations to make them even more versatile. Unlike CSS, we are not limited to Bezier curves here.

The same is about `draw`: we can animate anything, not just CSS properties.

# Logical operators

There are four logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&amp;&amp;` (AND), `!` (NOT), `??` (Nullish Coalescing). Here we cover the first three, the `??` operator is in the next article.

Although they are called &quot;logical&quot;, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.

Let&#39;s see the details.

## || (OR)

The &quot;OR&quot; operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

```js
result = a || b;
```

In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are `true`, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let&#39;s see what happens with boolean values.

There are four possible logical combinations:

```js run
alert(true || true); // true
alert(false || true); // true
alert(true || false); // true
alert(false || false); // false
```

As we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.

If an operand is not a boolean, it&#39;s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

For instance, the number `1` is treated as `true`, the number `0` as `false`:

```js run
if (1 || 0) {
  // works just like if( true || false )
  alert(&quot;truthy!&quot;);
}
```

Most of the time, OR `||` is used in an `if` statement to test if _any_ of the given conditions is `true`.

For example:

```js run
let hour = 9;

*!*
if (hour &lt; 10 || hour &gt; 18) {
*/!*
  alert( &#39;The office is closed.&#39; );
}
```

We can pass more conditions:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour &lt; 10 || hour &gt; 18 || isWeekend) {
  alert(&quot;The office is closed.&quot;); // it is the weekend
}
```

## OR &quot;||&quot; finds the first truthy value [#or-finds-the-first-truthy-value]

The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let&#39;s bring in the &quot;extra&quot; features of JavaScript.

The extended algorithm works as follows.

Given multiple OR&#39;ed values:

```js
result = value1 || value2 || value3;
```

The OR `||` operator does the following:

- Evaluates operands from left to right.
- For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is `true`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were `false`), returns the last operand.

A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

In other words, a chain of OR `||` returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

For instance:

```js run
alert(1 || 0); // 1 (1 is truthy)

alert(null || 1); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
alert(null || 0 || 1); // 1 (the first truthy value)

alert(undefined || null || 0); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
```

This leads to some interesting usage compared to a &quot;pure, classical, boolean-only OR&quot;.

1. **Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.**

   For instance, we have `firstName`, `lastName` and `nickName` variables, all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values).

   Let&#39;s use OR `||` to choose the one that has the data and show it (or `&quot;Anonymous&quot;` if nothing set):

   ```js run
   let firstName = &quot;&quot;;
   let lastName = &quot;&quot;;
   let nickName = &quot;SuperCoder&quot;;

   *!*
   alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || &quot;Anonymous&quot;); // SuperCoder
   */!*
   ```

   If all variables were falsy, `&quot;Anonymous&quot;` would show up.

2. **Short-circuit evaluation.**

   Another feature of OR `||` operator is the so-called &quot;short-circuit&quot; evaluation.

   It means that `||` processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.

   That importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn&#39;t just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call.

   In the example below, only the second message is printed:

   ```js run no-beautify
   *!*true*/!* || alert(&quot;not printed&quot;);
   *!*false*/!* || alert(&quot;printed&quot;);
   ```

   In the first line, the OR `||` operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing `true`, so the `alert` isn&#39;t run.

   Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.

## &amp;&amp; (AND)

The AND operator is represented with two ampersands `&amp;&amp;`:

```js
result = a &amp;&amp; b;
```

In classical programming, AND returns `true` if both operands are truthy and `false` otherwise:

```js run
alert(true &amp;&amp; true); // true
alert(false &amp;&amp; true); // false
alert(true &amp;&amp; false); // false
alert(false &amp;&amp; false); // false
```

An example with `if`:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 &amp;&amp; minute == 30) {
  alert(&quot;The time is 12:30&quot;);
}
```

Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

```js run
if (1 &amp;&amp; 0) {
  // evaluated as true &amp;&amp; false
  alert(&quot;won&#39;t work, because the result is falsy&quot;);
}
```

## AND &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; finds the first falsy value

Given multiple AND&#39;ed values:

```js
result = value1 &amp;&amp; value2 &amp;&amp; value3;
```

The AND `&amp;&amp;` operator does the following:

- Evaluates operands from left to right.
- For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is `false`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.

In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first _falsy_ value while OR returns the first _truthy_ one.

Examples:

```js run
// if the first operand is truthy,
// AND returns the second operand:
alert(1 &amp;&amp; 0); // 0
alert(1 &amp;&amp; 5); // 5

// if the first operand is falsy,
// AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
alert(null &amp;&amp; 5); // null
alert(0 &amp;&amp; &quot;no matter what&quot;); // 0
```

We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

```js run
alert(1 &amp;&amp; 2 &amp;&amp; null &amp;&amp; 3); // null
```

When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

```js run
alert(1 &amp;&amp; 2 &amp;&amp; 3); // 3, the last one
```

````smart header=&quot;Precedence of AND `&amp;&amp;`is higher than OR`||`&quot; The precedence of AND `&amp;&amp;`operator is higher than OR`||`.

So the code `a &amp;&amp; b || c &amp;&amp; d` is essentially the same as if the `&amp;&amp;` expressions were in parentheses: `(a &amp;&amp; b) || (c &amp;&amp; d)`.
</code></pre>
<p>```<code>warn header="Don't replace</code>if<code>with</code>||<code>or</code>&amp;&amp;<code>" Sometimes, people use the AND</code>&amp;&amp;<code>operator as a "shorter way to write</code>if`".</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let x = 1;</p>
<p>(x &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; alert( ‘Greater than zero!’ ); ```</p>
<p>The action in the right part of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That is, only if <code>(x &gt; 0)</code> is true.</p>
<p>So we basically have an analogue for:</p>
<p>```js run let x = 1;</p>
<p>if (x &gt; 0) alert( ‘Greater than zero!’ );</p>
<pre><code>
Although, the variant with `&amp;&amp;` appears shorter, `if` is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable. So we recommend using every construct for its purpose: use `if` if we want `if` and use `&amp;&amp;` if we want AND.</code></pre>
<h2 id="not">! (NOT)</h2>
<p>The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign <code>!</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is pretty simple:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb46-1" title="1">result <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">!</span>value<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Converts the operand to boolean type: <code>true/false</code>.</li>
<li>Returns the inverse value.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(!true); // false alert(!0); // true</code></p>
<p>A double NOT <code>!!</code> is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(!!"non-empty string"); // true alert(!!null); // false</code></p>
<p>That is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.</p>
<p>There’s a little more verbose way to do the same thing – a built-in <code>Boolean</code> function:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(Boolean("non-empty string")); // true alert(Boolean(null)); // false</code></p>
<p>The precedence of NOT <code>!</code> is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>.</p>
<h1 id="from-the-orbital-height">From the orbital height</h1>
<p>This section describes a set of modern standards for “web components”.</p>
<p>As of now, these standards are under development. Some features are well-supported and integrated into the modern HTML/DOM standard, while others are yet in draft stage. You can try examples in any browser, Google Chrome is probably the most up to date with these features. Guess, that’s because Google fellows are behind many of the related specifications.</p>
<h2 id="whats-common-between">What’s common between…</h2>
<p>The whole component idea is nothing new. It’s used in many frameworks and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Before we move to implementation details, take a look at this great achievement of humanity:</p>
<p><img src="satellite.jpg" /></p>
<p>That’s the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>And this is how it’s made inside (approximately):</p>
<p><img src="satellite-expanded.jpg" /></p>
<p>The International Space Station:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consists of many components.</li>
<li>Each component, in its turn, has many smaller details inside.</li>
<li>The components are very complex, much more complicated than most websites.</li>
<li>Components are developed internationally, by teams from different countries, speaking different languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>…And this thing flies, keeps humans alive in space!</p>
<p>How such complex devices are created?</p>
<p>Which principles we could borrow to make our development same-level reliable and scalable? Or, at least, close to it.</p>
<h2 id="component-architecture">Component architecture</h2>
<p>The well known rule for developing complex software is: don’t make complex software.</p>
<p>If something becomes complex – split it into simpler parts and connect in the most obvious way.</p>
<p><strong>A good architect is the one who can make the complex simple.</strong></p>
<p>We can split user interface into visual components: each of them has own place on the page, can “do” a well-described task, and is separate from the others.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a website, for example Twitter.</p>
<p>It naturally splits into components:</p>
<p><img src="web-components-twitter.svg" /></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Top navigation.</li>
<li>User info.</li>
<li>Follow suggestions.</li>
<li>Submit form.</li>
<li>(and also 6, 7) – messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Components may have subcomponents, e.g. messages may be parts of a higher-level “message list” component. A clickable user picture itself may be a component, and so on.</p>
<p>How do we decide, what is a component? That comes from intuition, experience and common sense. Usually it’s a separate visual entity that we can describe in terms of what it does and how it interacts with the page. In the case above, the page has blocks, each of them plays its own role, it’s logical to make these components.</p>
<p>A component has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its own JavaScript class.</li>
<li>DOM structure, managed solely by its class, outside code doesn’t access it (“encapsulation” principle).</li>
<li>CSS styles, applied to the component.</li>
<li>API: events, class methods etc, to interact with other components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the whole “component” thing is nothing special.</p>
<p>There exist many frameworks and development methodologies to build them, each with its own bells and whistles. Usually, special CSS classes and conventions are used to provide “component feel” – CSS scoping and DOM encapsulation.</p>
<p>“Web components” provide built-in browser capabilities for that, so we don’t have to emulate them any more.</p>

<li><a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#retarget">Event retargeting</a> and other minor stuff to make custom components better fit the development.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter we’ll go into details of “Custom Elements” – the fundamental and well-supported feature of web components, good on its own.</p>
<h1 id="custom-elements">Custom elements</h1>
<p>We can create custom HTML elements, described by our class, with its own methods and properties, events and so on.</p>
<p>Once a custom element is defined, we can use it on par with built-in HTML elements.</p>
<p>That’s great, as HTML dictionary is rich, but not infinite. There are no <code>&lt;easy-tabs&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;sliding-carousel&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;beautiful-upload&gt;</code>… Just think of any other tag we might need.</p>
<p>We can define them with a special class, and then use as if they were always a part of HTML.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of custom elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Autonomous custom elements</strong> – “all-new” elements, extending the abstract <code>HTMLElement</code> class.</li>
<li><strong>Customized built-in elements</strong> – extending built-in elements, like a customized button, based on <code>HTMLButtonElement</code> etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>First we’ll cover autonomous elements, and then move to customized built-in ones.</p>
<p>To create a custom element, we need to tell the browser several details about it: how to show it, what to do when the element is added or removed to page, etc.</p>
<p>That’s done by making a class with special methods. That’s easy, as there are only few methods, and all of them are optional.</p>
<p>Here’s a sketch with the full list:</p>

<p>After that, we need to register the element:</p>

<p>Now for any HTML elements with tag <code>&lt;my-element&gt;</code>, an instance of <code>MyElement</code> is created, and the aforementioned methods are called. We also can <code>document.createElement('my-element')</code> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Custom element name must contain a hyphen</code>-<code>" Custom element name must have a hyphen</code>-<code>, e.g.</code>my-element<code>and</code>super-button<code>are valid names, but</code>myelement` is not.</p>
<p>That’s to ensure that there are no name conflicts between built-in and custom HTML elements.</p>
<pre><code>
## Example: &quot;time-formatted&quot;

For example, there already exists `&lt;time&gt;` element in HTML, for date/time. But it doesn&#39;t do any formatting by itself.

Let&#39;s create `&lt;time-formatted&gt;` element that displays the time in a nice, language-aware format:


```html run height=50 autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot;
&lt;script&gt;
*!*
class TimeFormatted extends HTMLElement { // (1)
*/!*

  connectedCallback() {
    let date = new Date(this.getAttribute(&#39;datetime&#39;) || Date.now());

    this.innerHTML = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;default&quot;, {
      year: this.getAttribute(&#39;year&#39;) || undefined,
      month: this.getAttribute(&#39;month&#39;) || undefined,
      day: this.getAttribute(&#39;day&#39;) || undefined,
      hour: this.getAttribute(&#39;hour&#39;) || undefined,
      minute: this.getAttribute(&#39;minute&#39;) || undefined,
      second: this.getAttribute(&#39;second&#39;) || undefined,
      timeZoneName: this.getAttribute(&#39;time-zone-name&#39;) || undefined,
    }).format(date);
  }

}

*!*
customElements.define(&quot;time-formatted&quot;, TimeFormatted); // (2)
*/!*
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- (3) --&gt;
*!*
&lt;time-formatted datetime=&quot;2019-12-01&quot;
*/!*
  year=&quot;numeric&quot; month=&quot;long&quot; day=&quot;numeric&quot;
  hour=&quot;numeric&quot; minute=&quot;numeric&quot; second=&quot;numeric&quot;
  time-zone-name=&quot;short&quot;
&gt;&lt;/time-formatted&gt;</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The class has only one method <code>connectedCallback()</code> – the browser calls it when <code>&lt;time-formatted&gt;</code> element is added to page (or when HTML parser detects it), and it uses the built-in <a href="mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat">Intl.DateTimeFormat</a> data formatter, well-supported across the browsers, to show a nicely formatted time.</li>
<li>We need to register our new element by <code>customElements.define(tag, class)</code>.</li>
<li>And then we can use it everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>``<code>smart header="Custom elements upgrade" If the browser encounters any</code><time-formatted><code>elements before</code>customElements.define`, that’s not an error. But the element is yet unknown, just like any non-standard tag.</p>
<p>Such “undefined” elements can be styled with CSS selector <code>:not(:defined)</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>customElement.define</code> is called, they are “upgraded”: a new instance of <code>TimeFormatted</code> is created for each, and <code>connectedCallback</code> is called. They become <code>:defined</code>.</p>
<p>To get the information about custom elements, there are methods: - <code>customElements.get(name)</code> – returns the class for a custom element with the given <code>name</code>, - <code>customElements.whenDefined(name)</code> – returns a promise that resolves (without value) when a custom element with the given <code>name</code> becomes defined. ```</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Rendering in</code>connectedCallback<code>, not in</code>constructor<code>" In the example above, element content is rendered (created) in</code>connectedCallback`.</p>
<p>Why not in the <code>constructor</code>?</p>
<p>The reason is simple: when <code>constructor</code> is called, it’s yet too early. The element is created, but the browser did not yet process/assign attributes at this stage: calls to <code>getAttribute</code> would return <code>null</code>. So we can’t really render there.</p>
<p>Besides, if you think about it, that’s better performance-wise – to delay the work until it’s really needed.</p>
<p>The <code>connectedCallback</code> triggers when the element is added to the document. Not just appended to another element as a child, but actually becomes a part of the page. So we can build detached DOM, create elements and prepare them for later use. They will only be actually rendered when they make it into the page.</p>
<pre><code>
## Observing attributes

In the current implementation of `&lt;time-formatted&gt;`, after the element is rendered, further attribute changes don&#39;t have any effect. That&#39;s strange for an HTML element. Usually, when we change an attribute, like `a.href`, we expect the change to be immediately visible. So let&#39;s fix this.

We can observe attributes by providing their list in `observedAttributes()` static getter. For such attributes, `attributeChangedCallback` is called when they are modified. It doesn&#39;t trigger for other, unlisted attributes (that&#39;s for performance reasons).

Here&#39;s a new `&lt;time-formatted&gt;`, that auto-updates when attributes change:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; height=50
&lt;script&gt;
class TimeFormatted extends HTMLElement {

*!*
  render() { // (1)
*/!*
    let date = new Date(this.getAttribute(&#39;datetime&#39;) || Date.now());

    this.innerHTML = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;default&quot;, {
      year: this.getAttribute(&#39;year&#39;) || undefined,
      month: this.getAttribute(&#39;month&#39;) || undefined,
      day: this.getAttribute(&#39;day&#39;) || undefined,
      hour: this.getAttribute(&#39;hour&#39;) || undefined,
      minute: this.getAttribute(&#39;minute&#39;) || undefined,
      second: this.getAttribute(&#39;second&#39;) || undefined,
      timeZoneName: this.getAttribute(&#39;time-zone-name&#39;) || undefined,
    }).format(date);
  }

*!*
  connectedCallback() { // (2)
*/!*
    if (!this.rendered) {
      this.render();
      this.rendered = true;
    }
  }

*!*
  static get observedAttributes() { // (3)
*/!*
    return [&#39;datetime&#39;, &#39;year&#39;, &#39;month&#39;, &#39;day&#39;, &#39;hour&#39;, &#39;minute&#39;, &#39;second&#39;, &#39;time-zone-name&#39;];
  }

*!*
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) { // (4)
*/!*
    this.render();
  }

}

customElements.define(&quot;time-formatted&quot;, TimeFormatted);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;time-formatted id=&quot;elem&quot; hour=&quot;numeric&quot; minute=&quot;numeric&quot; second=&quot;numeric&quot;&gt;&lt;/time-formatted&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
*!*
setInterval(() =&gt; elem.setAttribute(&#39;datetime&#39;, new Date()), 1000); // (5)
*/!*
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The rendering logic is moved to <code>render()</code> helper method.</li>
<li>We call it once when the element is inserted into page.</li>
<li>For a change of an attribute, listed in <code>observedAttributes()</code>, <code>attributeChangedCallback</code> triggers.</li>
<li>…and re-renders the element.</li>
<li>At the end, we can easily make a live timer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rendering-order">Rendering order</h2>
<p>When HTML parser builds the DOM, elements are processed one after another, parents before children. E.g. if we have <code>&lt;outer&gt;&lt;inner&gt;&lt;/inner&gt;&lt;/outer&gt;</code>, then <code>&lt;outer&gt;</code> element is created and connected to DOM first, and then <code>&lt;inner&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>That leads to important consequences for custom elements.</p>
<p>For example, if a custom element tries to access <code>innerHTML</code> in <code>connectedCallback</code>, it gets nothing:</p>
```html run height=40
<script>
  customElements.define('user-info', class extends HTMLElement {

    connectedCallback() {
  *!*
      alert(this.innerHTML); // empty (*)
  */!*
    }

  });
</script>
<p><em>!</em> <user-info>John</user-info> <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>If you run it, the <code>alert</code> is empty.</p>
<p>That’s exactly because there are no children on that stage, the DOM is unfinished. HTML parser connected the custom element <code>&lt;user-info&gt;</code>, and is going to proceed to its children, but just didn’t yet.</p>
<p>If we’d like to pass information to custom element, we can use attributes. They are available immediately.</p>
<p>Or, if we really need the children, we can defer access to them with zero-delay <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>
<p>This works:</p>
```html run height=40
<script>
  customElements.define('user-info', class extends HTMLElement {

    connectedCallback() {
  *!*
      setTimeout(() => alert(this.innerHTML)); // John (*)
  */!*
    }

  });
</script>
<p><em>!</em> <user-info>John</user-info> <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Now the <code>alert</code> in line <code>(*)</code> shows “John”, as we run it asynchronously, after the HTML parsing is complete. We can process children if needed and finish the initialization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this solution is also not perfect. If nested custom elements also use <code>setTimeout</code> to initialize themselves, then they queue up: the outer <code>setTimeout</code> triggers first, and then the inner one.</p>
<p>So the outer element finishes the initialization before the inner one.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate that on example:</p>
``<code>html run height=0 &lt;script&gt;   customElements.define(     "user-info",     class extends HTMLElement {       connectedCallback() {         alert(</code><span class="math inline">${this.id} connected.`);  setTimeout(() =&gt; alert(`$</span>{this.id} initialized.`)); } } );
</script>
<p><em>!</em> <user-info id="outer"> <user-info id="inner"></user-info> </user-info> <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Output order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>outer connected.</li>
<li>inner connected.</li>
<li>outer initialized.</li>
<li>inner initialized.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can clearly see that the outer element finishes initialization <code>(3)</code> before the inner one <code>(4)</code>.</p>
<p>There’s no built-in callback that triggers after nested elements are ready. If needed, we can implement such thing on our own. For instance, inner elements can dispatch events like <code>initialized</code>, and outer ones can listen and react on them.</p>
<h2 id="customized-built-in-elements">Customized built-in elements</h2>
<p>New elements that we create, such as <code>&lt;time-formatted&gt;</code>, don’t have any associated semantics. They are unknown to search engines, and accessibility devices can’t handle them.</p>
<p>But such things can be important. E.g, a search engine would be interested to know that we actually show a time. And if we’re making a special kind of button, why not reuse the existing <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> functionality?</p>
<p>We can extend and customize built-in HTML elements by inheriting from their classes.</p>
<p>For example, buttons are instances of <code>HTMLButtonElement</code>, let’s build upon it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Extend <code>HTMLButtonElement</code> with our class:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-1" title="1"><span class="kw">class</span> HelloButton <span class="kw">extends</span> HTMLButtonElement <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-2" title="2">  <span class="co">/* custom element methods */</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Provide the third argument to <code>customElements.define</code>, that specifies the tag:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb52"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb52-1" title="1"><span class="va">customElements</span>.<span class="at">define</span>(<span class="st">&#39;hello-button&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> HelloButton<span class="op">,</span> <span class="op">*!*{</span><span class="dt">extends</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&#39;button&#39;</span><span class="op">}*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*)</span><span class="ss">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>There may be different tags that share the same DOM-class, that’s why specifying <code>extends</code> is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end, to use our custom element, insert a regular <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag, but add <code>is="hello-button"</code> to it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb53"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb53-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;button</span><span class="ot"> is=</span><span class="st">&quot;hello-button&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>...<span class="kw">&lt;/button&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a full example:</p>
```html run autorun=“no-epub”
<script>
  // The button that says "hello" on click
  class HelloButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
  *!*
    constructor() {
  */!*
      super();
      this.addEventListener('click', () => alert("Hello!"));
    }
  }

  *!*
  customElements.define('hello-button', HelloButton, {extends: 'button'});
  */!*
</script>
<p><em>!</em> <button is="hello-button">Click me</button> <em>/!</em> <em>!</em> <button is="hello-button" disabled>Disabled</button> <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Our new button extends the built-in one. So it keeps the same styles and standard features like <code>disabled</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Custom elements are well-supported among browsers. There’s a polyfill <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs" class="uri">https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs</a>.</p>
<h1 id="shadow-dom">Shadow DOM</h1>
<p>Shadow DOM serves for encapsulation. It allows a component to have its very own “shadow” DOM tree, that can’t be accidentally accessed from the main document, may have local style rules, and more.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-shadow-dom">Built-in shadow DOM</h2>
<p>Did you ever think how complex browser controls are created and styled?</p>
<p>Such as <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code>:</p>
<p>
<input type="range">
</p>
<p>The browser uses DOM/CSS internally to draw them. That DOM structure is normally hidden from us, but we can see it in developer tools. E.g. in Chrome, we need to enable in Dev Tools “Show user agent shadow DOM” option.</p>
<p>Then <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="shadow-dom-range.png" /></p>
<p>What you see under <code>#shadow-root</code> is called “shadow DOM”.</p>
<p>We can’t get built-in shadow DOM elements by regular JavaScript calls or selectors. These are not regular children, but a powerful encapsulation technique.</p>
<p>In the example above, we can see a useful attribute <code>pseudo</code>. It’s non-standard, exists for historical reasons. We can use it style subelements with CSS, like this:</p>
```html run autorun
<style>
  /* make the slider track red */
  input::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {
    background: red;
  }
</style>
<p><input type="range" /> ```</p>
<p>Once again, <code>pseudo</code> is a non-standard attribute. Chronologically, browsers first started to experiment with internal DOM structures to implement controls, and then, after time, shadow DOM was standardized to allow us, developers, to do the similar thing.</p>
<p>Further on, we’ll use the modern shadow DOM standard, covered by <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees">DOM spec</a> and other related specifications.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-tree">Shadow tree</h2>
<p>A DOM element can have two types of DOM subtrees:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Light tree – a regular DOM subtree, made of HTML children. All subtrees that we’ve seen in previous chapters were “light”.</li>
<li>Shadow tree – a hidden DOM subtree, not reflected in HTML, hidden from prying eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an element has both, then the browser renders only the shadow tree. But we can setup a kind of composition between shadow and light trees as well. We’ll see the details later in the chapter <a href="info:slots-composition" class="uri">info:slots-composition</a>.</p>
<p>Shadow tree can be used in Custom Elements to hide component internals and apply component-local styles.</p>
<p>For example, this <code>&lt;show-hello&gt;</code> element hides its internal DOM in shadow tree:</p>
``<code>html run autorun height=60 &lt;script&gt;   customElements.define(     "show-hello",     class extends HTMLElement {       connectedCallback() {         const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });         shadow.innerHTML =</code>
<p>
Hello, ${this.getAttribute(“name”)}
</p>
`; } } );
</script>
<p><show-hello name="John"></show-hello> ```</p>
<p>That’s how the resulting DOM looks in Chrome dev tools, all the content is under “#shadow-root”:</p>
<p><img src="shadow-dom-say-hello.png" /></p>
<p>First, the call to <code>elem.attachShadow({mode: …})</code> creates a shadow tree.</p>
<p>There are two limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We can create only one shadow root per element.</li>
<li>The <code>elem</code> must be either a custom element, or one of: “article”, “aside”, “blockquote”, “body”, “div”, “footer”, “h1..h6”, “header”, “main” “nav”, “p”, “section”, or “span”. Other elements, like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, can’t host shadow tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>mode</code> option sets the encapsulation level. It must have any of two values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>"open"</code> – the shadow root is available as <code>elem.shadowRoot</code>.</p>
<p>Any code is able to access the shadow tree of <code>elem</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>"closed"</code> – <code>elem.shadowRoot</code> is always <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>We can only access the shadow DOM by the reference returned by <code>attachShadow</code> (and probably hidden inside a class). Browser-native shadow trees, such as <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code>, are closed. There’s no way to access them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadowroot">shadow root</a>, returned by <code>attachShadow</code>, is like an element: we can use <code>innerHTML</code> or DOM methods, such as <code>append</code>, to populate it.</p>
<p>The element with a shadow root is called a “shadow tree host”, and is available as the shadow root <code>host</code> property:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-1" title="1"><span class="co">// assuming {mode: &quot;open&quot;}, otherwise elem.shadowRoot is null</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-2" title="2"><span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="va">elem</span>.<span class="va">shadowRoot</span>.<span class="at">host</span> <span class="op">===</span> elem)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// true</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h2>
<p>Shadow DOM is strongly delimited from the main document:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Shadow DOM elements are not visible to <code>querySelector</code> from the light DOM. In particular, Shadow DOM elements may have ids that conflict with those in the light DOM. They must be unique only within the shadow tree.</li>
<li>Shadow DOM has own stylesheets. Style rules from the outer DOM don’t get applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
```html run untrusted height=40
<style>
  *!*
  /* document style won't apply to the shadow tree inside #elem (1) */
*/!*
  p {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<div id="elem">

</div>
<script>
    elem.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
  *!*
      // shadow tree has its own style (2)
  */!*
    elem.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style> p { font-weight: bold; } </style>
      <p>Hello, John!</p>
    `;

  *!*
    // <p> is only visible from queries inside the shadow tree (3)
  */!*
    alert(document.querySelectorAll('p').length); // 0
    alert(elem.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll('p').length); // 1
</script>
<p>```</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The style from the document does not affect the shadow tree.</li>
<li>…But the style from the inside works.</li>
<li>To get elements in shadow tree, we must query from inside the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>Shadow DOM is a way to create a component-local DOM.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>shadowRoot = elem.attachShadow({mode: open|closed})</code> – creates shadow DOM for <code>elem</code>. If <code>mode="open"</code>, then it’s accessible as <code>elem.shadowRoot</code> property.</li>
<li>We can populate <code>shadowRoot</code> using <code>innerHTML</code> or other DOM methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shadow DOM elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have their own ids space,</li>
<li>Invisible to JavaScript selectors from the main document, such as <code>querySelector</code>,</li>
<li>Use styles only from the shadow tree, not from the main document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shadow DOM, if exists, is rendered by the browser instead of so-called “light DOM” (regular children). In the chapter <a href="info:slots-composition" class="uri">info:slots-composition</a> we’ll see how to compose them.</p>
<h1 id="template-element">Template element</h1>
<p>A built-in <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element serves as a storage for HTML markup templates. The browser ignores it contents, only checks for syntax validity, but we can access and use it in JavaScript, to create other elements.</p>
<p>In theory, we could create any invisible element somewhere in HTML for HTML markup storage purposes. What’s special about <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>?</p>
<p>First, its content can be any valid HTML, even if it normally requires a proper enclosing tag.</p>
<p>For example, we can put there a table row <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;template&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">&lt;tr&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-3" title="3">    <span class="kw">&lt;td&gt;</span>Contents<span class="kw">&lt;/td&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-4" title="4">  <span class="kw">&lt;/tr&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-5" title="5"><span class="kw">&lt;/template&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Usually, if we try to put <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> inside, say, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the browser detects the invalid DOM structure and “fixes” it, adds <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> around. That’s not what we want. On the other hand, <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> keeps exactly what we place there.</p>
<p>We can put styles and scripts into <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> as well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;template&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">&lt;style&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-3" title="3">    p {</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-4" title="4">      <span class="kw">font-weight</span>: <span class="dv">bold</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-5" title="5">    }</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-6" title="6">  <span class="kw">&lt;/style&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-7" title="7">  <span class="kw">&lt;script&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-8" title="8">    <span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-9" title="9">  <span class="kw">&lt;/script&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-10" title="10"><span class="kw">&lt;/template&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The browser considers <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> content “out of the document”: styles are not applied, scripts are not executed, <code>&lt;video autoplay&gt;</code> is not run, etc.</p>
<p>The content becomes live (styles apply, scripts run etc) when we insert it into the document.</p>
<h2 id="inserting-template">Inserting template</h2>
<p>The template content is available in its <code>content</code> property as a <a href="info:modifying-document#document-fragment">DocumentFragment</a> – a special type of DOM node.</p>
<p>We can treat it as any other DOM node, except one special property: when we insert it somewhere, its children are inserted instead.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
```html run <template id="tmpl">
<script>
    alert("Hello");
  </script>
<div class="message">
Hello, world!
</div>
<p></template></p>
<script>
    let elem = document.createElement('div');

  *!*
    // Clone the template content to reuse it multiple times
    elem.append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));
  */!*

    document.body.append(elem);
    // Now the script from <template> runs
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>Let’s rewrite a Shadow DOM example from the previous chapter using <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>:</p>
```html run untrusted autorun=“no-epub” height=60 <template id="tmpl">
<style>
    p {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  </style>
<p id="message">
</p>
<p></template></p>
<div id="elem">
Click me
</div>
<script>
    elem.onclick = function() {
      elem.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});

  *!*
      elem.shadowRoot.append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true)); // (*)
  */!*

      elem.shadowRoot.getElementById('message').innerHTML = "Hello from the shadows!";
    };
</script>
<p>```</p>
<p>In the line <code>(*)</code> when we clone and insert <code>tmpl.content</code>, as its <code>DocumentFragment</code>, its children (<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) are inserted instead.</p>
<p>They form the shadow DOM:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;elem&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-2" title="2">  #shadow-root</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">&lt;style&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-4" title="4">    p {</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-5" title="5">      <span class="kw">font-weight</span>: <span class="dv">bold</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-6" title="6">    }</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-7" title="7">  <span class="kw">&lt;/style&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-8" title="8">  <span class="kw">&lt;p</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;message&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-9" title="9"><span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="summary-10">Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;template&gt;</code> content can be any syntactically correct HTML.</li>
<li><code>&lt;template&gt;</code> content is considered “out of the document”, so it doesn’t affect anything.</li>
<li>We can access <code>template.content</code> from JavaScript, clone it to reuse in a new component.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag is quite unique, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser checks HTML syntax inside it (as opposed to using a template string inside a script).</li>
<li>…But still allows use of any top-level HTML tags, even those that don’t make sense without proper wrappers (e.g. <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>The content becomes interactive: scripts run, <code>&lt;video autoplay&gt;</code> plays etc, when inserted into the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element does not feature any iteration mechanisms, data binding or variable substitutions, but we can implement those on top of it.</p>
<h1 id="shadow-dom-slots-composition">Shadow DOM slots, composition</h1>
<p>Many types of components, such as tabs, menus, image galleries, and so on, need the content to render.</p>
<p>Just like built-in browser <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> expects <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> items, our <code>&lt;custom-tabs&gt;</code> may expect the actual tab content to be passed. And a <code>&lt;custom-menu&gt;</code> may expect menu items.</p>
<p>The code that makes use of <code>&lt;custom-menu&gt;</code> can look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;custom-menu&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">&lt;title&gt;</span>Candy menu<span class="kw">&lt;/title&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">&lt;item&gt;</span>Lollipop<span class="kw">&lt;/item&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-4" title="4">  <span class="kw">&lt;item&gt;</span>Fruit Toast<span class="kw">&lt;/item&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-5" title="5">  <span class="kw">&lt;item&gt;</span>Cup Cake<span class="kw">&lt;/item&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-6" title="6"><span class="kw">&lt;/custom-menu&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>…Then our component should render it properly, as a nice menu with given title and items, handle menu events, etc.</p>
<p>How to implement it?</p>
<p>We could try to analyze the element content and dynamically copy-rearrange DOM nodes. That’s possible, but if we’re moving elements to shadow DOM, then CSS styles from the document do not apply in there, so the visual styling may be lost. Also that requires some coding.</p>
<p>Luckily, we don’t have to. Shadow DOM supports <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> elements, that are automatically filled by the content from light DOM.</p>
<h2 id="named-slots">Named slots</h2>
<p>Let’s see how slots work on a simple example.</p>
<p>Here, <code>&lt;user-card&gt;</code> shadow DOM provides two slots, filled from light DOM:</p>
``<code>html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80 &lt;script&gt; customElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {   connectedCallback() {     this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});     this.shadowRoot.innerHTML =</code>
<div>
Name: <em>!</em> <slot name="username"></slot> <em>/!</em>
</div>
<pre><code>  &lt;div&gt;Birthday:</code></pre>
<em>!</em> <slot name="birthday"></slot> <em>/!</em>
</div>
<pre><code>`;</code></pre>
} });
</script>
<p><user-card> &lt;span <em>!</em>slot=“username”<em>/!</em>&gt;John Smith</span> &lt;span <em>!</em>slot=“birthday”<em>/!</em>&gt;01.01.2001</span> </user-card> ```</p>
<p>In the shadow DOM, <code>&lt;slot name="X"&gt;</code> defines an “insertion point”, a place where elements with <code>slot="X"</code> are rendered.</p>
<p>Then the browser performs “composition”: it takes elements from the light DOM and renders them in corresponding slots of the shadow DOM. At the end, we have exactly what we want – a component that can be filled with data.</p>
<p>Here’s the DOM structure after the script, not taking composition into account:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;user-card&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-2" title="2">  #shadow-root</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">&lt;div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-4" title="4">    Name:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-5" title="5">    <span class="kw">&lt;slot</span><span class="ot"> name=</span><span class="st">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-7" title="7">  <span class="kw">&lt;div&gt;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-13" title="13"><span class="kw">&lt;/user-card&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We created the shadow DOM, so here it is, under <code>#shadow-root</code>. Now the element has both light and shadow DOM.</p>
<p>For rendering purposes, for each <code>&lt;slot name="..."&gt;</code> in shadow DOM, the browser looks for <code>slot="..."</code> with the same name in the light DOM. These elements are rendered inside the slots:</p>
<p><img src="shadow-dom-user-card.svg" /></p>
<p>The result is called “flattened” DOM:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;user-card&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-2" title="2">  #shadow-root</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">&lt;div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-4" title="4">    Name:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-5" title="5">    <span class="kw">&lt;slot</span><span class="ot"> name=</span><span class="st">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-9" title="9">  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-10" title="10">  <span class="kw">&lt;div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-11" title="11">    Birthday:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-12" title="12">    <span class="kw">&lt;slot</span><span class="ot"> name=</span><span class="st">&quot;birthday&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-13" title="13">      <span class="kw">&lt;span</span><span class="ot"> slot=</span><span class="st">&quot;birthday&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>01.01.2001<span class="kw">&lt;/span&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-14" title="14">    <span class="kw">&lt;/slot&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-15" title="15">  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-16" title="16"><span class="kw">&lt;/user-card&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>…But the flattened DOM exists only for rendering and event-handling purposes. It’s kind of “virtual”. That’s how things are shown. But the nodes in the document are actually not moved around!</p>
<p>That can be easily checked if we run <code>querySelectorAll</code>: nodes are still at their places.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-1" title="1"><span class="co">// light DOM &lt;span&gt; nodes are still at the same place, under `&lt;user-card&gt;`</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-2" title="2"><span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="va">document</span>.<span class="at">querySelectorAll</span>(<span class="st">&quot;user-card span&quot;</span>).<span class="at">length</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 2</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So, the flattened DOM is derived from shadow DOM by inserting slots. The browser renders it and uses for style inheritance, event propagation (more about that later). But JavaScript still sees the document “as is”, before flattening.</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Only top-level children may have slot="..." attribute" The</code>slot=“…”<code>attribute is only valid for direct children of the shadow host (in our example,</code><user-card>` element). For nested elements it’s ignored.</p>
<p>For example, the second <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> here is ignored (as it’s not a top-level child of <code>&lt;user-card&gt;</code>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;user-card&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">&lt;span</span><span class="ot"> slot=</span><span class="st">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>John Smith<span class="kw">&lt;/span&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">&lt;div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-4" title="4">    <span class="co">&lt;!-- invalid slot, must be direct child of user-card --&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-5" title="5">    <span class="kw">&lt;span</span><span class="ot"> slot=</span><span class="st">&quot;birthday&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>01.01.2001<span class="kw">&lt;/span&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-6" title="6">  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-7" title="7"><span class="kw">&lt;/user-card&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>
If there are multiple elements in light DOM with the same slot name, they are appended into the slot, one after another.

For example, this:

```html
&lt;user-card&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

Gives this flattened DOM with two elements in `&lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;`:

```html
&lt;user-card&gt;
  #shadow-root
  &lt;div&gt;
    Name:
    &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Birthday:
    &lt;slot name=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

## Slot fallback content

If we put something inside a `&lt;slot&gt;`, it becomes the fallback, &quot;default&quot; content. The browser shows it if there&#39;s no corresponding filler in light DOM.

For example, in this piece of shadow DOM, `Anonymous` renders if there&#39;s no `slot=&quot;username&quot;` in light DOM.

```html
&lt;div&gt;
  Name:
  &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Anonymous&lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

## Default slot: first unnamed

The first `&lt;slot&gt;` in shadow DOM that doesn&#39;t have a name is a &quot;default&quot; slot. It gets all nodes from the light DOM that aren&#39;t slotted elsewhere.

For example, let&#39;s add the default slot to our `&lt;user-card&gt;` that shows all unslotted information about the user:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=140
&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
    &lt;div&gt;Name:
      &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Birthday:
      &lt;slot name=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
      &lt;legend&gt;Other information&lt;/legend&gt;
*!*
      &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
*/!*
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
    `;
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;user-card&gt;
  *!*
  &lt;div&gt;I like to swim.&lt;/div&gt;
  */!*
  &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;01.01.2001&lt;/span&gt;
  *!*
  &lt;div&gt;...And play volleyball too!&lt;/div&gt;
  */!*
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

All the unslotted light DOM content gets into the &quot;Other information&quot; fieldset.

Elements are appended to a slot one after another, so both unslotted pieces of information are in the default slot together.

The flattened DOM looks like this:

```html
&lt;user-card&gt;
  #shadow-root
  &lt;div&gt;
    Name:
    &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Birthday:
    &lt;slot name=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;01.01.2001&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Other information&lt;/legend&gt;
    *!*
    &lt;slot&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I like to swim.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;...And play volleyball too!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
    */!*
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

## Menu example

Now let&#39;s back to `&lt;custom-menu&gt;`, mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.

We can use slots to distribute elements.

Here&#39;s the markup for `&lt;custom-menu&gt;`:

```html
&lt;custom-menu&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Candy menu&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Lollipop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Fruit Toast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Cup Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/custom-menu&gt;
```

The shadow DOM template with proper slots:

```html
&lt;template id=&quot;tmpl&quot;&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    /* menu styles */
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
    &lt;slot name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
```

1. `&lt;span slot=&quot;title&quot;&gt;` goes into `&lt;slot name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;`.
2. There are many `&lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;` in the template, but only one `&lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;` in the template. So all such `&lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;` are appended to `&lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;` one after another, thus forming the list.

The flattened DOM becomes:

```html
&lt;custom-menu&gt;
  #shadow-root
  &lt;style&gt;
    /* menu styles */
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
    &lt;slot name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Candy menu&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Lollipop&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Fruit Toast&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Cup Cake&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/custom-menu&gt;
```

One might notice that, in a valid DOM, `&lt;li&gt;` must be a direct child of `&lt;ul&gt;`. But that&#39;s flattened DOM, it describes how the component is rendered, such thing happens naturally here.

We just need to add a `click` handler to open/close the list, and the `&lt;custom-menu&gt;` is ready:

```js
customElements.define(
  &quot;custom-menu&quot;,
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });

      // tmpl is the shadow DOM template (above)
      this.shadowRoot.append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));

      // we can&#39;t select light DOM nodes, so let&#39;s handle clicks on the slot
      this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&#39;slot[name=&quot;title&quot;]&#39;).onclick = () =&gt; {
        // open/close the menu
        this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&quot;.menu&quot;).classList.toggle(&quot;closed&quot;);
      };
    }
  }
);
```

Here&#39;s the full demo:

[iframe src=&quot;menu&quot; height=140 edit]

Of course, we can add more functionality to it: events, methods and so on.

## Updating slots

What if the outer code wants to add/remove menu items dynamically?

**The browser monitors slots and updates the rendering if slotted elements are added/removed.**

Also, as light DOM nodes are not copied, but just rendered in slots, the changes inside them immediately become visible.

So we don&#39;t have to do anything to update rendering. But if the component code wants to know about slot changes, then `slotchange` event is available.

For example, here the menu item is inserted dynamically after 1 second, and the title changes after 2 seconds:

```html run untrusted height=80
&lt;custom-menu id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Candy menu&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/custom-menu&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;custom-menu&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `&lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
      &lt;slot name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;`;

        // shadowRoot can&#39;t have event handlers, so using the first child
        this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.addEventListener(&quot;slotchange&quot;, (e) =&gt;
          alert(&quot;slotchange: &quot; + e.target.name)
        );
      }
    }
  );

  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    menu.insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeEnd&quot;, &#39;&lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Lollipop&lt;/li&gt;&#39;);
  }, 1000);

  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    menu.querySelector(&#39;[slot=&quot;title&quot;]&#39;).innerHTML = &quot;New menu&quot;;
  }, 2000);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The menu rendering updates each time without our intervention.

There are two `slotchange` events here:

1. At initialization:

   `slotchange: title` triggers immediately, as the `slot=&quot;title&quot;` from the light DOM gets into the corresponding slot.

2. After 1 second:

   `slotchange: item` triggers, when a new `&lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;` is added.

Please note: there&#39;s no `slotchange` event after 2 seconds, when the content of `slot=&quot;title&quot;` is modified. That&#39;s because there&#39;s no slot change. We modify the content inside the slotted element, that&#39;s another thing.

If we&#39;d like to track internal modifications of light DOM from JavaScript, that&#39;s also possible using a more generic mechanism: [MutationObserver](info:mutation-observer).

## Slot API

Finally, let&#39;s mention the slot-related JavaScript methods.

As we&#39;ve seen before, JavaScript looks at the &quot;real&quot; DOM, without flattening. But, if the shadow tree has `{mode: &#39;open&#39;}`, then we can figure out which elements assigned to a slot and, vise-versa, the slot by the element inside it:

- `node.assignedSlot` -- returns the `&lt;slot&gt;` element that the `node` is assigned to.
- `slot.assignedNodes({flatten: true/false})` -- DOM nodes, assigned to the slot. The `flatten` option is `false` by default. If explicitly set to `true`, then it looks more deeply into the flattened DOM, returning nested slots in case of nested components and the fallback content if no node assigned.
- `slot.assignedElements({flatten: true/false})` -- DOM elements, assigned to the slot (same as above, but only element nodes).

These methods are useful when we need not just show the slotted content, but also track it in JavaScript.

For example, if `&lt;custom-menu&gt;` component wants to know, what it shows, then it could track `slotchange` and get the items from `slot.assignedElements`:

```html run untrusted height=120
&lt;custom-menu id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Candy menu&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Lollipop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Fruit Toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/custom-menu&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(&#39;custom-menu&#39;, class extends HTMLElement {
    items = []

    connectedCallback() {
      this.attachShadow({mode: &#39;open&#39;});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `&lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
        &lt;slot name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;item&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;`;

      // triggers when slot content changes
  *!*
      this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.addEventListener(&#39;slotchange&#39;, e =&gt; {
        let slot = e.target;
        if (slot.name == &#39;item&#39;) {
          this.items = slot.assignedElements().map(elem =&gt; elem.textContent);
          alert(&quot;Items: &quot; + this.items);
        }
      });
  */!*
    }
  });

  // items update after 1 second
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    menu.insertAdjacentHTML(&#39;beforeEnd&#39;, &#39;&lt;li slot=&quot;item&quot;&gt;Cup Cake&lt;/li&gt;&#39;)
  }, 1000);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

## Summary

Usually, if an element has shadow DOM, then its light DOM is not displayed. Slots allow to show elements from light DOM in specified places of shadow DOM.

There are two kinds of slots:

- Named slots: `&lt;slot name=&quot;X&quot;&gt;...&lt;/slot&gt;` -- gets light children with `slot=&quot;X&quot;`.
- Default slot: the first `&lt;slot&gt;` without a name (subsequent unnamed slots are ignored) -- gets unslotted light children.
- If there are many elements for the same slot -- they are appended one after another.
- The content of `&lt;slot&gt;` element is used as a fallback. It&#39;s shown if there are no light children for the slot.

The process of rendering slotted elements inside their slots is called &quot;composition&quot;. The result is called a &quot;flattened DOM&quot;.

Composition does not really move nodes, from JavaScript point of view the DOM is still same.

JavaScript can access slots using methods:

- `slot.assignedNodes/Elements()` -- returns nodes/elements inside the `slot`.
- `node.assignedSlot` -- the reverse property, returns slot by a node.

If we&#39;d like to know what we&#39;re showing, we can track slot contents using:

- `slotchange` event -- triggers the first time a slot is filled, and on any add/remove/replace operation of the slotted element, but not its children. The slot is `event.target`.
- [MutationObserver](info:mutation-observer) to go deeper into slot content, watch changes inside it.

Now, as we know how to show elements from light DOM in shadow DOM, let&#39;s see how to style them properly. The basic rule is that shadow elements are styled inside, and light elements -- outside, but there are notable exceptions.

We&#39;ll see the details in the next chapter.

# Shadow DOM styling

Shadow DOM may include both `&lt;style&gt;` and `&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;` tags. In the latter case, stylesheets are HTTP-cached, so they are not redownloaded for multiple components that use same template.

As a general rule, local styles work only inside the shadow tree, and document styles work outside of it. But there are few exceptions.

## :host

The `:host` selector allows to select the shadow host (the element containing the shadow tree).

For instance, we&#39;re making `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` element that should be centered. For that we need to style the `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` element itself.

That&#39;s exactly what `:host` does:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;template id=&quot;tmpl&quot;&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    /* the style will be applied from inside to the custom-dialog element */
    :host {
      position: fixed;
      left: 50%;
      top: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      display: inline-block;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;custom-dialog&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; }).append(
          tmpl.content.cloneNode(true)
        );
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;custom-dialog&gt; Hello! &lt;/custom-dialog&gt;
```

## Cascading

The shadow host (`&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` itself) resides in the light DOM, so it&#39;s affected by document CSS rules.

If there&#39;s a property styled both in `:host` locally, and in the document, then the document style takes precedence.

For instance, if in the document we had:

```html
&lt;style&gt;
  custom-dialog {
    padding: 0;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
```

...Then the `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` would be without padding.

It&#39;s very convenient, as we can setup &quot;default&quot; component styles in its `:host` rule, and then easily override them in the document.

The exception is when a local property is labelled `!important`, for such properties, local styles take precedence.

## :host(selector)

Same as `:host`, but applied only if the shadow host matches the `selector`.

For example, we&#39;d like to center the `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` only if it has `centered` attribute:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;template id=&quot;tmpl&quot;&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    *!*
        :host([centered]) {
    */!*
          position: fixed;
          left: 50%;
          top: 50%;
          transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
          border-color: blue;
        }

        :host {
          display: inline-block;
          border: 1px solid red;
          padding: 10px;
        }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;custom-dialog&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; }).append(
          tmpl.content.cloneNode(true)
        );
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;custom-dialog centered&gt; Centered! &lt;/custom-dialog&gt;

&lt;custom-dialog&gt; Not centered. &lt;/custom-dialog&gt;
```

Now the additional centering styles are only applied to the first dialog: `&lt;custom-dialog centered&gt;`.

## :host-context(selector)

Same as `:host`, but applied only if the shadow host or any of its ancestors in the outer document matches the `selector`.

E.g. `:host-context(.dark-theme)` matches only if there&#39;s `dark-theme` class on `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` on anywhere above it:

```html
&lt;body class=&quot;dark-theme&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--
    :host-context(.dark-theme) applies to custom-dialogs inside .dark-theme
  --&gt;
  &lt;custom-dialog&gt;...&lt;/custom-dialog&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

To summarize, we can use `:host`-family of selectors to style the main element of the component, depending on the context. These styles (unless `!important`) can be overridden by the document.

## Styling slotted content

Now let&#39;s consider the situation with slots.

Slotted elements come from light DOM, so they use document styles. Local styles do not affect slotted content.

In the example below, slotted `&lt;span&gt;` is bold, as per document style, but does not take `background` from the local style:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;style&gt;
  *!*
    span { font-weight: bold }
  */!*
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;user-card&gt;
  &lt;div slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;*!*&lt;span&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;*/!*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      &lt;style&gt;
*!*
      span { background: red; }
*/!*
      &lt;/style&gt;
      Name: &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    `;
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;
```

The result is bold, but not red.

If we&#39;d like to style slotted elements in our component, there are two choices.

First, we can style the `&lt;slot&gt;` itself and rely on CSS inheritance:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;user-card&gt;
  &lt;div slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;*!*&lt;span&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;*/!*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      &lt;style&gt;
*!*
      slot[name=&quot;username&quot;] { font-weight: bold; }
*/!*
      &lt;/style&gt;
      Name: &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    `;
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Here `&lt;p&gt;John Smith&lt;/p&gt;` becomes bold, because CSS inheritance is in effect between the `&lt;slot&gt;` and its contents. But in CSS itself not all properties are inherited.

Another option is to use `::slotted(selector)` pseudo-class. It matches elements based on two conditions:

1. That&#39;s a slotted element, that comes from the light DOM. Slot name doesn&#39;t matter. Just any slotted element, but only the element itself, not its children.
2. The element matches the `selector`.

In our example, `::slotted(div)` selects exactly `&lt;div slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;`, but not its children:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;user-card&gt;
  &lt;div slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;John Smith&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      &lt;style&gt;
*!*
      ::slotted(div) { border: 1px solid red; }
*/!*
      &lt;/style&gt;
      Name: &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    `;
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Please note, `::slotted` selector can&#39;t descend any further into the slot. These selectors are invalid:

```css
::slotted(div span) {
  /* our slotted &lt;div&gt; does not match this */
}

::slotted(div) p {
  /* can&#39;t go inside light DOM */
}
```

Also, `::slotted` can only be used in CSS. We can&#39;t use it in `querySelector`.

## CSS hooks with custom properties

How do we style internal elements of a component from the main document?

Selectors like `:host` apply rules to `&lt;custom-dialog&gt;` element or `&lt;user-card&gt;`, but how to style shadow DOM elements inside them?

There&#39;s no selector that can directly affect shadow DOM styles from the document. But just as we expose methods to interact with our component, we can expose CSS variables (custom CSS properties) to style it.

**Custom CSS properties exist on all levels, both in light and shadow.**

For example, in shadow DOM we can use `--user-card-field-color` CSS variable to style fields, and the outer document can set its value:

```html
&lt;style&gt;
  .field {
    color: var(--user-card-field-color, black);
    /* if --user-card-field-color is not defined, use black color */
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field&quot;&gt;Name: &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field&quot;&gt;Birthday: &lt;slot name=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

Then, we can declare this property in the outer document for `&lt;user-card&gt;`:

```css
user-card {
  --user-card-field-color: green;
}
```

Custom CSS properties pierce through shadow DOM, they are visible everywhere, so the inner `.field` rule will make use of it.

Here&#39;s the full example:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=80
&lt;style&gt;
  *!*
    user-card {
      --user-card-field-color: green;
    }
  */!*
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;template id=&quot;tmpl&quot;&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    *!*
        .field {
          color: var(--user-card-field-color, black);
        }
    */!*
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;field&quot;&gt;Name: &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;field&quot;&gt;Birthday: &lt;slot name=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.append(
          document.getElementById(&quot;tmpl&quot;).content.cloneNode(true)
        );
      }
    }
  );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;user-card&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span slot=&quot;birthday&quot;&gt;01.01.2001&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

## Summary

Shadow DOM can include styles, such as `&lt;style&gt;` or `&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;`.

Local styles can affect:

- shadow tree,
- shadow host with `:host`-family pseudoclasses,
- slotted elements (coming from light DOM), `::slotted(selector)` allows to select slotted elements themselves, but not their children.

Document styles can affect:

- shadow host (as it lives in the outer document)
- slotted elements and their contents (as that&#39;s also in the outer document)

When CSS properties conflict, normally document styles have precedence, unless the property is labelled as `!important`. Then local styles have precedence.

CSS custom properties pierce through shadow DOM. They are used as &quot;hooks&quot; to style the component:

1. The component uses a custom CSS property to style key elements, such as `var(--component-name-title, &lt;default value&gt;)`.
2. Component author publishes these properties for developers, they are same important as other public component methods.
3. When a developer wants to style a title, they assign `--component-name-title` CSS property for the shadow host or above.
4. Profit!

# Shadow DOM and events

The idea behind shadow tree is to encapsulate internal implementation details of a component.

Let&#39;s say, a click event happens inside a shadow DOM of `&lt;user-card&gt;` component. But scripts in the main document have no idea about the shadow DOM internals, especially if the component comes from a 3rd-party library.

So, to keep the details encapsulated, the browser _retargets_ the event.

**Events that happen in shadow DOM have the host element as the target, when caught outside of the component.**

Here&#39;s a simple example:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=60
&lt;user-card&gt;&lt;/user-card&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `&lt;p&gt;
      &lt;button&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;`;
        this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.onclick = (e) =&gt;
          alert(&quot;Inner target: &quot; + e.target.tagName);
      }
    }
  );

  document.onclick = (e) =&gt; alert(&quot;Outer target: &quot; + e.target.tagName);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

If you click on the button, the messages are:

1. Inner target: `BUTTON` -- internal event handler gets the correct target, the element inside shadow DOM.
2. Outer target: `USER-CARD` -- document event handler gets shadow host as the target.

Event retargeting is a great thing to have, because the outer document doesn&#39;t have to know about component internals. From its point of view, the event happened on `&lt;user-card&gt;`.

**Retargeting does not occur if the event occurs on a slotted element, that physically lives in the light DOM.**

For example, if a user clicks on `&lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;` in the example below, the event target is exactly this `span` element, for both shadow and light handlers:

```html run autorun=&quot;no-epub&quot; untrusted height=60
&lt;user-card id=&quot;userCard&quot;&gt;
  *!*
  &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;
  */!*
&lt;/user-card&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  customElements.define(
    &quot;user-card&quot;,
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.attachShadow({ mode: &quot;open&quot; });
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Name:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;`;

        this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.onclick = (e) =&gt;
          alert(&quot;Inner target: &quot; + e.target.tagName);
      }
    }
  );

  userCard.onclick = (e) =&gt; alert(`Outer target: ${e.target.tagName}`);
&lt;/script&gt;
```

If a click happens on `&quot;John Smith&quot;`, for both inner and outer handlers the target is `&lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;`. That&#39;s an element from the light DOM, so no retargeting.

On the other hand, if the click occurs on an element originating from shadow DOM, e.g. on `&lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt;`, then, as it bubbles out of the shadow DOM, its `event.target` is reset to `&lt;user-card&gt;`.

## Bubbling, event.composedPath()

For purposes of event bubbling, flattened DOM is used.

So, if we have a slotted element, and an event occurs somewhere inside it, then it bubbles up to the `&lt;slot&gt;` and upwards.

The full path to the original event target, with all the shadow elements, can be obtained using `event.composedPath()`. As we can see from the name of the method, that path is taken after the composition.

In the example above, the flattened DOM is:

```html
&lt;user-card id=&quot;userCard&quot;&gt;
  #shadow-root
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Name:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;slot name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/user-card&gt;
```

So, for a click on `&lt;span slot=&quot;username&quot;&gt;`, a call to `event.composedPath()` returns an array: [`span`, `slot`, `div`, `shadow-root`, `user-card`, `body`, `html`, `document`, `window`]. That&#39;s exactly the parent chain from the target element in the flattened DOM, after the composition.

```warn header=&quot;Shadow tree details are only provided for `{mode:&#39;open&#39;}`trees&quot; If the shadow tree was created with`{mode: &#39;closed&#39;}`, then the composed path starts from the host: `user-card` and upwards.

That&#39;s the similar principle as for other methods that work with shadow DOM. Internals of closed trees are completely hidden.

<h2 id="event.composed">event.composed</h2>
<p>Most events successfully bubble through a shadow DOM boundary. There are few events that do not.</p>
<p>This is governed by the <code>composed</code> event object property. If it’s <code>true</code>, then the event does cross the boundary. Otherwise, it only can be caught from inside the shadow DOM.</p>
<p>If you take a look at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents">UI Events specification</a>, most events have <code>composed: true</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>blur</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>focusin</code>, <code>focusout</code>,</li>
<li><code>click</code>, <code>dblclick</code>,</li>
<li><code>mousedown</code>, <code>mouseup</code> <code>mousemove</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseover</code>,</li>
<li><code>wheel</code>,</li>
<li><code>beforeinput</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>keydown</code>, <code>keyup</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All touch events and pointer events also have <code>composed: true</code>.</p>
<p>There are some events that have <code>composed: false</code> though:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mouseenter</code>, <code>mouseleave</code> (they do not bubble at all),</li>
<li><code>load</code>, <code>unload</code>, <code>abort</code>, <code>error</code>,</li>
<li><code>select</code>,</li>
<li><code>slotchange</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These events can be caught only on elements within the same DOM, where the event target resides.</p>
<h2 id="custom-events-1">Custom events</h2>
<p>When we dispatch custom events, we need to set both <code>bubbles</code> and <code>composed</code> properties to <code>true</code> for it to bubble up and out of the component.</p>
<p>For example, here we create <code>div#inner</code> in the shadow DOM of <code>div#outer</code> and trigger two events on it. Only the one with <code>composed: true</code> makes it outside to the document:</p>
```html run untrusted height=0
<div id="outer">

</div>
<script>
outer.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});

let inner = document.createElement('div');
outer.shadowRoot.append(inner);

/*
div(id=outer)
  #shadow-dom
    div(id=inner)
*/

document.addEventListener('test', event => alert(event.detail));

inner.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('test', {
  bubbles: true,
*!*
  composed: true,
*/!*
  detail: "composed"
}));

inner.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('test', {
  bubbles: true,
*!*
  composed: false,
*/!*
  detail: "not composed"
}));
</script>
<p>````</p>
<h2 id="summary-11">Summary</h2>
<p>Events only cross shadow DOM boundaries if their <code>composed</code> flag is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Built-in events mostly have <code>composed: true</code>, as described in the relevant specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI Events <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents" class="uri">https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents</a>.</li>

<li>Pointer Events <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents" class="uri">https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents</a>.</li>
<li>…And so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some built-in events that have <code>composed: false</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mouseenter</code>, <code>mouseleave</code> (also do not bubble),</li>
<li><code>load</code>, <code>unload</code>, <code>abort</code>, <code>error</code>,</li>
<li><code>select</code>,</li>
<li><code>slotchange</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These events can be caught only on elements within the same DOM.</p>
<p>If we dispatch a <code>CustomEvent</code>, then we should explicitly set <code>composed: true</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that in case of nested components, one shadow DOM may be nested into another. In that case composed events bubble through all shadow DOM boundaries. So, if an event is intended only for the immediate enclosing component, we can also dispatch it on the shadow host and set <code>composed: false</code>. Then it’s out of the component shadow DOM, but won’t bubble up to higher-level DOM.</p>
<h1 id="patterns-and-flags">Patterns and flags</h1>
<p>Regular expressions are patterns that provide a powerful way to search and replace in text.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, they are available via the <a href="mdn:js/RegExp">RegExp</a> object, as well as being integrated in methods of strings.</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>A regular expression (also “regexp”, or just “reg”) consists of a <em>pattern</em> and optional <em>flags</em>.</p>
<p>There are two syntaxes that can be used to create a regular expression object.</p>
<p>The “long” syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-1" title="1">regexp <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">RegExp</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pattern&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;flags&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And the “short” one, using slashes <code>"/"</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-1" title="1">regexp <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ss">/pattern/</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// no flags</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-2" title="2">regexp <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ss">/pattern/gim</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// with flags g,m and i (to be covered soon)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Slashes <code>pattern:/.../</code> tell JavaScript that we are creating a regular expression. They play the same role as quotes for strings.</p>
<p>In both cases <code>regexp</code> becomes an instance of the built-in <code>RegExp</code> class.</p>
<p>The main difference between these two syntaxes is that pattern using slashes <code>/.../</code> does not allow for expressions to be inserted (like string template literals with <code>${...}</code>). They are fully static.</p>
<p>Slashes are used when we know the regular expression at the code writing time – and that’s the most common situation. While <code>new RegExp</code> is more often used when we need to create a regexp “on the fly” from a dynamically generated string. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> tag <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;What tag do you want to find?&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;h2&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-3" title="3"><span class="kw">let</span> regexp <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">RegExp</span>(<span class="vs">`&lt;</span><span class="sc">${</span>tag<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs">&gt;`</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// same as /&lt;h2&gt;/ if answered &quot;h2&quot; in the prompt above</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>
<p>Regular expressions may have flags that affect the search.</p>
<p>There are only 6 of them in JavaScript:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>pattern:i</code></dt>
<dd>With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between <code>A</code> and <code>a</code> (see the example below).
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:g</code></dt>
<dd>With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it – only the first match is returned.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:m</code></dt>
<dd>Multiline mode (covered in the chapter <a href="info:regexp-multiline-mode" class="uri">info:regexp-multiline-mode</a>).
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:s</code></dt>
<dd>Enables “dotall” mode, that allows a dot <code>pattern:.</code> to match newline character <code>\n</code> (covered in the chapter <a href="info:regexp-character-classes" class="uri">info:regexp-character-classes</a>).
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:u</code></dt>
<dd>Enables full Unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate pairs. More about that in the chapter <a href="info:regexp-unicode" class="uri">info:regexp-unicode</a>.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:y</code></dt>
<dd>“Sticky” mode: searching at the exact position in the text (covered in the chapter <a href="info:regexp-sticky" class="uri">info:regexp-sticky</a>)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>```smart header=“Colors” From here on the color scheme is:</p>
<ul>
<li>regexp – <code>pattern:red</code></li>
<li>string (where we search) – <code>subject:blue</code></li>
<li>result – <code>match:green</code> ```</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="searching-str.match">Searching: str.match</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, regular expressions are integrated with string methods.</p>
<p>The method <code>str.match(regexp)</code> finds all matches of <code>regexp</code> in the string <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>It has 3 working modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If the regular expression has flag <code>pattern:g</code>, it returns an array of all matches:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “We will, we will rock you”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/we/gi)); // We,we (an array of 2 substrings that match) ```</p>
<p>Please note that both <code>match:We</code> and <code>match:we</code> are found, because flag <code>pattern:i</code> makes the regular expression case-insensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>If there’s no such flag it returns only the first match in the form of an array, with the full match at index <code>0</code> and some additional details in properties:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “We will, we will rock you”;</p>
<p>let result = str.match(/we/i); // without flag g</p>
<p>alert(result[0]); // We (1st match) alert(result.length); // 1</p>
<p>// Details: alert(result.index); // 0 (position of the match) alert(result.input); // We will, we will rock you (source string) ```</p>
<p>The array may have other indexes, besides <code>0</code> if a part of the regular expression is enclosed in parentheses. We’ll cover that in the chapter <a href="info:regexp-groups" class="uri">info:regexp-groups</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>And, finally, if there are no matches, <code>null</code> is returned (doesn’t matter if there’s flag <code>pattern:g</code> or not).</p>
<p>This a very important nuance. If there are no matches, we don’t receive an empty array, but instead receive <code>null</code>. Forgetting about that may lead to errors, e.g.:</p>
<p>```js run let matches = “JavaScript”.match(/HTML/); // = null</p>
<p>if (!matches.length) { // Error: Cannot read property ‘length’ of null alert(“Error in the line above”); } ```</p>
<p>If we’d like the result to always be an array, we can write it this way:</p>
<p>```js run let matches = “JavaScript”.match(/HTML/)<em>!</em> || []<em>/!</em>;</p>
<p>if (!matches.length) { alert(“No matches”); // now it works } ```</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="replacing-str.replace">Replacing: str.replace</h2>
<p>The method <code>str.replace(regexp, replacement)</code> replaces matches found using <code>regexp</code> in string <code>str</code> with <code>replacement</code> (all matches if there’s flag <code>pattern:g</code>, otherwise, only the first one).</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run // no flag g alert(“We will, we will”.replace(/we/i, “I”)); // I will, we will</p>
<p>// with flag g alert(“We will, we will”.replace(/we/gi, “I”)); // I will, I will ```</p>
<p>The second argument is the <code>replacement</code> string. We can use special character combinations in it to insert fragments of the match:</p>

<p>Later in this chapter we’ll study more regular expressions, walk through more examples, and also meet other methods.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="character-classes">Character classes</h1>
<p>Consider a practical task – we have a phone number like <code>"+7(903)-123-45-67"</code>, and we need to turn it into pure numbers: <code>79031234567</code>.</p>
<p>To do so, we can find and remove anything that’s not a number. Character classes can help with that.</p>
<p>A <em>character class</em> is a special notation that matches any symbol from a certain set.</p>
<p>For the start, let’s explore the “digit” class. It’s written as <code>pattern:\d</code> and corresponds to “any single digit”.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s find the first digit in the phone number:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “+7(903)-123-45-67”;</p>
<p>let regexp = /;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // 7 ```</p>
<p>Without the flag <code>pattern:g</code>, the regular expression only looks for the first match, that is the first digit <code>pattern:\d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s add the <code>pattern:g</code> flag to find all digits:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “+7(903)-123-45-67”;</p>
<p>let regexp = /g;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // array of matches: 7,9,0,3,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</p>
<p>// let’s make the digits-only phone number of them: alert(str.match(regexp).join("")); // 79031234567 ```</p>
<p>That was a character class for digits. There are other character classes as well.</p>
<p>Most used are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>pattern:\d</code> (“d” is from “digit”)</dt>
<dd>A digit: a character from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:\s</code> (“s” is from “space”)</dt>
<dd>A space symbol: includes spaces, tabs <code>\t</code>, newlines <code>\n</code> and few other rare characters, such as <code>\v</code>, <code>\f</code> and <code>\r</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:\w</code> (“w” is from “word”)</dt>
<dd>A “wordly” character: either a letter of Latin alphabet or a digit or an underscore <code>_</code>. Non-Latin letters (like cyrillic or hindi) do not belong to <code>pattern:\w</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For instance, <code>pattern:\d\s\w</code> means a “digit” followed by a “space character” followed by a “wordly character”, such as <code>match:1 a</code>.</p>
<p><strong>A regexp may contain both regular symbols and character classes.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, <code>pattern:CSS\d</code> matches a string <code>match:CSS</code> with a digit after it:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Is there CSS4?”; let regexp = /CSS;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // CSS4 ```</p>
<p>Also we can use many character classes:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("I love HTML5!".match(/\s\w\w\w\w\d/)); // ' HTML5'</code></p>
<p>The match (each regexp character class has the corresponding result character):</p>
<p><img src="love-html5-classes.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="inverse-classes">Inverse classes</h2>
<p>For every character class there exists an “inverse class”, denoted with the same letter, but uppercased.</p>
<p>The “inverse” means that it matches all other characters, for instance:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>pattern:\D</code></dt>
<dd>Non-digit: any character except <code>pattern:\d</code>, for instance a letter.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:\S</code></dt>
<dd>Non-space: any character except <code>pattern:\s</code>, for instance a letter.
</dd>
<dt><code>pattern:\W</code></dt>
<dd>Non-wordly character: anything but <code>pattern:\w</code>, e.g a non-latin letter or a space.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the beginning of the chapter we saw how to make a number-only phone number from a string like <code>subject:+7(903)-123-45-67</code>: find all digits and join them.</p>
<p>```js run let str = “+7(903)-123-45-67”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/g).join("")); // 79031234567 ```</p>
<p>An alternative, shorter way is to find non-digits <code>pattern:\D</code> and remove them from the string:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “+7(903)-123-45-67”;</p>
<p>alert(str.replace(//g, "")); // 79031234567 ```</p>
<h2 id="a-dot-is-any-character">A dot is “any character”</h2>
<p>A dot <code>pattern:.</code> is a special character class that matches “any character except a newline”.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("Z".match(/./)); // Z</code></p>
<p>Or in the middle of a regexp:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /CS.4/;</p>
<p>alert(“CSS4”.match(regexp)); // CSS4 alert(“CS-4”.match(regexp)); // CS-4 alert(“CS 4”.match(regexp)); // CS 4 (space is also a character) ```</p>
<p>Please note that a dot means “any character”, but not the “absence of a character”. There must be a character to match it:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("CS4".match(/CS.4/)); // null, no match because there's no character for the dot</code></p>
<h3 id="dot-as-literally-any-character-with-s-flag">Dot as literally any character with “s” flag</h3>
<p>By default, a dot doesn’t match the newline character <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, the regexp <code>pattern:A.B</code> matches <code>match:A</code>, and then <code>match:B</code> with any character between them, except a newline <code>\n</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("A\nB".match(/A.B/)); // null (no match)</code></p>
<p>There are many situations when we’d like a dot to mean literally “any character”, newline included.</p>
<p>That’s what flag <code>pattern:s</code> does. If a regexp has it, then a dot <code>pattern:.</code> matches literally any character:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("A\nB".match(/A.B/s)); // A\nB (match!)</code></p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Not supported in IE" The</code>pattern:s` flag is not supported in IE.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s an alternative, that works everywhere. We can use a regexp like <code>pattern:[\s\S]</code> to match “any character” (this pattern will be covered in the article <a href="info:regexp-character-sets-and-ranges" class="uri">info:regexp-character-sets-and-ranges</a>).</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "A\nB".match(/A[\s\S]B/) ); // A\nB (match!)</code></p>
<p>The pattern <code>pattern:[\s\S]</code> literally says: “a space character OR not a space character”. In other words, “anything”. We could use another pair of complementary classes, such as <code>pattern:[\d\D]</code>, that doesn’t matter. Or even the <code>pattern:[^]</code> – as it means match any character except nothing.</p>
<p>Also we can use this trick if we want both kind of “dots” in the same pattern: the actual dot <code>pattern:.</code> behaving the regular way (“not including a newline”), and also a way to match “any character” with <code>pattern:[\s\S]</code> or alike. ````</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Pay attention to spaces" Usually we pay little attention to spaces. For us strings</code>subject:1-5<code>and</code>subject:1 - 5` are nearly identical.</p>
<p>But if a regexp doesn’t take spaces into account, it may fail to work.</p>
<p>Let’s try to find digits separated by a hyphen:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "1 - 5".match(/\d-\d/) ); // null, no match!</code></p>
<p>Let’s fix it adding spaces into the regexp <code>pattern:\d - \d</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "1 - 5".match(/\d - \d/) ); // 1 - 5, now it works // or we can use \s class: alert( "1 - 5".match(/\d\s-\s\d/) ); // 1 - 5, also works</code></p>
<p><strong>A space is a character. Equal in importance with any other character.</strong></p>
<p>We can’t add or remove spaces from a regular expression and expect it to work the same.</p>
<p>In other words, in a regular expression all characters matter, spaces too.</p>
<pre><code>
## Summary

There exist following character classes:

- `pattern:\d` -- digits.
- `pattern:\D` -- non-digits.
- `pattern:\s` -- space symbols, tabs, newlines.
- `pattern:\S` -- all but `pattern:\s`.
- `pattern:\w` -- Latin letters, digits, underscore `&#39;_&#39;`.
- `pattern:\W` -- all but `pattern:\w`.
- `pattern:.` -- any character if with the regexp `&#39;s&#39;` flag, otherwise any except a newline `\n`.

...But that&#39;s not all!

Unicode encoding, used by JavaScript for strings, provides many properties for characters, like: which language the letter belongs to (if it&#39;s a letter), is it a punctuation sign, etc.

We can search by these properties as well. That requires flag `pattern:u`, covered in the next article.

# Unicode: flag &quot;u&quot; and class \p{...}

JavaScript uses [Unicode encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) for strings. Most characters are encoded with 2 bytes, but that allows to represent at most 65536 characters.

That range is not big enough to encode all possible characters, that&#39;s why some rare characters are encoded with 4 bytes, for instance like `𝒳` (mathematical X) or `😄` (a smile), some hieroglyphs and so on.

Here are the Unicode values of some characters:

| Character | Unicode   | Bytes count in Unicode |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| a         | `0x0061`  | 2                      |
| ≈         | `0x2248`  | 2                      |
| 𝒳         | `0x1d4b3` | 4                      |
| 𝒴         | `0x1d4b4` | 4                      |
| 😄        | `0x1f604` | 4                      |

So characters like `a` and `≈` occupy 2 bytes, while codes for `𝒳`, `𝒴` and `😄` are longer, they have 4 bytes.

Long time ago, when JavaScript language was created, Unicode encoding was simpler: there were no 4-byte characters. So, some language features still handle them incorrectly.

For instance, `length` thinks that here are two characters:

```js run
alert(&quot;😄&quot;.length); // 2
alert(&quot;𝒳&quot;.length); // 2
```

...But we can see that there&#39;s only one, right? The point is that `length` treats 4 bytes as two 2-byte characters. That&#39;s incorrect, because they must be considered only together (so-called &quot;surrogate pair&quot;, you can read about them in the article &lt;info:string&gt;).

By default, regular expressions also treat 4-byte &quot;long characters&quot; as a pair of 2-byte ones. And, as it happens with strings, that may lead to odd results. We&#39;ll see that a bit later, in the article &lt;info:regexp-character-sets-and-ranges&gt;.

Unlike strings, regular expressions have flag `pattern:u` that fixes such problems. With such flag, a regexp handles 4-byte characters correctly. And also Unicode property search becomes available, we&#39;ll get to it next.

## Unicode properties \p{...}

Every character in Unicode has a lot of properties. They describe what &quot;category&quot; the character belongs to, contain miscellaneous information about it.

For instance, if a character has `Letter` property, it means that the character belongs to an alphabet (of any language). And `Number` property means that it&#39;s a digit: maybe Arabic or Chinese, and so on.

We can search for characters with a property, written as `pattern:\p{…}`. To use `pattern:\p{…}`, a regular expression must have flag `pattern:u`.

For instance, `\p{Letter}` denotes a letter in any language. We can also use `\p{L}`, as `L` is an alias of `Letter`. There are shorter aliases for almost every property.

In the example below three kinds of letters will be found: English, Georgian and Korean.

```js run
let str = &quot;A ბ ㄱ&quot;;

alert(str.match(/\p{L}/gu)); // A,ბ,ㄱ
alert(str.match(/\p{L}/g)); // null (no matches, \p doesn&#39;t work without the flag &quot;u&quot;)
```

Here&#39;s the main character categories and their subcategories:

- Letter `L`:
  - lowercase `Ll`
  - modifier `Lm`,
  - titlecase `Lt`,
  - uppercase `Lu`,
  - other `Lo`.
- Number `N`:
  - decimal digit `Nd`,
  - letter number `Nl`,
  - other `No`.
- Punctuation `P`:
  - connector `Pc`,
  - dash `Pd`,
  - initial quote `Pi`,
  - final quote `Pf`,
  - open `Ps`,
  - close `Pe`,
  - other `Po`.
- Mark `M` (accents etc):
  - spacing combining `Mc`,
  - enclosing `Me`,
  - non-spacing `Mn`.
- Symbol `S`:
  - currency `Sc`,
  - modifier `Sk`,
  - math `Sm`,
  - other `So`.
- Separator `Z`:
  - line `Zl`,
  - paragraph `Zp`,
  - space `Zs`.
- Other `C`:
  - control `Cc`,
  - format `Cf`,
  - not assigned `Cn`,
  - private use `Co`,
  - surrogate `Cs`.

So, e.g. if we need letters in lower case, we can write `pattern:\p{Ll}`, punctuation signs: `pattern:\p{P}` and so on.

There are also other derived categories, like:

- `Alphabetic` (`Alpha`), includes Letters `L`, plus letter numbers `Nl` (e.g. Ⅻ - a character for the roman number 12), plus some other symbols `Other_Alphabetic` (`OAlpha`).
- `Hex_Digit` includes hexadecimal digits: `0-9`, `a-f`.
- ...And so on.

Unicode supports many different properties, their full list would require a lot of space, so here are the references:

- List all properties by a character: &lt;https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp&gt;.
- List all characters by a property: &lt;https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp&gt;.
- Short aliases for properties: &lt;https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropertyValueAliases.txt&gt;.
- A full base of Unicode characters in text format, with all properties, is here: &lt;https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/&gt;.

### Example: hexadecimal numbers

For instance, let&#39;s look for hexadecimal numbers, written as `xFF`, where `F` is a hex digit (0..1 or A..F).

A hex digit can be denoted as `pattern:\p{Hex_Digit}`:

```js run
let regexp = /x\p{Hex_Digit}\p{Hex_Digit}/u;

alert(&quot;number: xAF&quot;.match(regexp)); // xAF
```

### Example: Chinese hieroglyphs

Let&#39;s look for Chinese hieroglyphs.

There&#39;s a Unicode property `Script` (a writing system), that may have a value: `Cyrillic`, `Greek`, `Arabic`, `Han` (Chinese) and so on, [here&#39;s the full list](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unicode)&gt;).

To look for characters in a given writing system we should use `pattern:Script=&lt;value&gt;`, e.g. for Cyrillic letters: `pattern:\p{sc=Cyrillic}`, for Chinese hieroglyphs: `pattern:\p{sc=Han}`, and so on:

```js run
let regexp = /\p{sc=Han}/gu; // returns Chinese hieroglyphs

let str = `Hello Привет 你好 123_456`;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // 你,好
```

### Example: currency

Characters that denote a currency, such as `$`, `€`, `¥`, have Unicode property `pattern:\p{Currency_Symbol}`, the short alias: `pattern:\p{Sc}`.

Let&#39;s use it to look for prices in the format &quot;currency, followed by a digit&quot;:

```js run
let regexp = /\p{Sc}\d/gu;

let str = `Prices: $2, €1, ¥9`;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // $2,€1,¥9
```

Later, in the article &lt;info:regexp-quantifiers&gt; we&#39;ll see how to look for numbers that contain many digits.

## Summary

Flag `pattern:u` enables the support of Unicode in regular expressions.

That means two things:

1. Characters of 4 bytes are handled correctly: as a single character, not two 2-byte characters.
2. Unicode properties can be used in the search: `\p{…}`.

With Unicode properties we can look for words in given languages, special characters (quotes, currencies) and so on.

# Nullish coalescing operator &#39;??&#39;

[recent browser=&quot;new&quot;]

The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks `??`.

As it treats `null` and `undefined` similarly, we&#39;ll use a special term here, in this article. We&#39;ll say that an expression is &quot;defined&quot; when it&#39;s neither `null` nor `undefined`.

The result of `a ?? b` is:

- if `a` is defined, then `a`,
- if `a` isn&#39;t defined, then `b`.

In other words, `??` returns the first argument if it&#39;s not `null/undefined`. Otherwise, the second one.

The nullish coalescing operator isn&#39;t anything completely new. It&#39;s just a nice syntax to get the first &quot;defined&quot; value of the two.

We can rewrite `result = a ?? b` using the operators that we already know, like this:

```js
result = a !== null &amp;&amp; a !== undefined ? a : b;
```

Now it should be absolutely clear what `??` does. Let&#39;s see where it helps.

The common use case for `??` is to provide a default value for a potentially undefined variable.

For example, here we show `user` if defined, otherwise `Anonymous`:

```js run
let user;

alert(user ?? &quot;Anonymous&quot;); // Anonymous (user not defined)
```

Here&#39;s the example with `user` assigned to a name:

```js run
let user = &quot;John&quot;;

alert(user ?? &quot;Anonymous&quot;); // John (user defined)
```

We can also use a sequence of `??` to select the first value from a list that isn&#39;t `null/undefined`.

Let&#39;s say we have a user&#39;s data in variables `firstName`, `lastName` or `nickName`. All of them may be not defined, if the user decided not to enter a value.

We&#39;d like to display the user name using one of these variables, or show &quot;Anonymous&quot; if all of them aren&#39;t defined.

Let&#39;s use the `??` operator for that:

```js run
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = &quot;Supercoder&quot;;

// shows the first defined value:
*!*
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? &quot;Anonymous&quot;); // Supercoder
*/!*
```

## Comparison with ||

The OR `||` operator can be used in the same way as `??`, as it was described in the [previous chapter](info:logical-operators#or-finds-the-first-truthy-value).

For example, in the code above we could replace `??` with `||` and still get the same result:

```js run
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = &quot;Supercoder&quot;;

// shows the first truthy value:
*!*
alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || &quot;Anonymous&quot;); // Supercoder
*/!*
```

Historically, the OR `||` operator was there first. It exists since the beginning of JavaScript, so developers were using it for such purposes for a long time.

On the other hand, the nullish coalescing operator `??` was added to JavaScript only recently, and the reason for that was that people weren&#39;t quite happy with `||`.

The important difference between them is that:

- `||` returns the first _truthy_ value.
- `??` returns the first _defined_ value.

In other words, `||` doesn&#39;t distinguish between `false`, `0`, an empty string `&quot;&quot;` and `null/undefined`. They are all the same -- falsy values. If any of these is the first argument of `||`, then we&#39;ll get the second argument as the result.

In practice though, we may want to use default value only when the variable is `null/undefined`. That is, when the value is really unknown/not set.

For example, consider this:

```js run
let height = 0;

alert(height || 100); // 100
alert(height ?? 100); // 0
```

- The `height || 100` checks `height` for being a falsy value, and it&#39;s `0`, falsy indeed.
  - so the result of `||` is the second argument, `100`.
- The `height ?? 100` checks `height` for being `null/undefined`, and it&#39;s not,
  - so the result is `height` &quot;as is&quot;, that is `0`.

In practice, the zero height is often a valid value, that shouldn&#39;t be replaced with the default. So `??` does just the right thing.

## Precedence

The precedence of the `??` operator is about the same as `||`, just a bit lower. It equals `5` in the [MDN table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table), while `||` is `6`.

That means that, just like `||`, the nullish coalescing operator `??` is evaluated before `=` and `?`, but after most other operations, such as `+`, `*`.

So if we&#39;d like to choose a value with `??` in an expression with other operators, consider adding parentheses:

```js run
let height = null;
let width = null;

// important: use parentheses
let area = (height ?? 100) * (width ?? 50);

alert(area); // 5000
```

Otherwise, if we omit parentheses, then as `*` has the higher precedence than `??`, it would execute first, leading to incorrect results.

```js
// without parentheses
let area = height ?? 100 * width ?? 50;

// ...works the same as this (probably not what we want):
let area = height ?? 100 * width ?? 50;
```

### Using ?? with &amp;&amp; or ||

Due to safety reasons, JavaScript forbids using `??` together with `&amp;&amp;` and `||` operators, unless the precedence is explicitly specified with parentheses.

The code below triggers a syntax error:

```js run
let x = 1 &amp;&amp; 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error
```

The limitation is surely debatable, it was added to the language specification with the purpose to avoid programming mistakes, when people start to switch from `||` to `??`.

Use explicit parentheses to work around it:

```js run
*!*
let x = (1 &amp;&amp; 2) ?? 3; // Works
*/!*

alert(x); // 2
```

## Summary

- The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short way to choose the first &quot;defined&quot; value from a list.

  It&#39;s used to assign default values to variables:

  ```js
  // set height=100, if height is null or undefined
  height = height ?? 100;
  ```

- The operator `??` has a very low precedence, only a bit higher than `?` and `=`, so consider adding parentheses when using it in an expression.
- It&#39;s forbidden to use it with `||` or `&amp;&amp;` without explicit parentheses.

# Anchors: string start ^ and end $

The caret `pattern:^` and dollar `pattern:$` characters have special meaning in a regexp. They are called &quot;anchors&quot;.

The caret `pattern:^` matches at the beginning of the text, and the dollar `pattern:$` -- at the end.

For instance, let&#39;s test if the text starts with `Mary`:

```js run
let str1 = &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot;;
alert(/^Mary/.test(str1)); // true
```

The pattern `pattern:^Mary` means: &quot;string start and then Mary&quot;.

Similar to this, we can test if the string ends with `snow` using `pattern:snow$`:

```js run
let str1 = &quot;it&#39;s fleece was white as snow&quot;;
alert(/snow$/.test(str1)); // true
```

In these particular cases we could use string methods `startsWith/endsWith` instead. Regular expressions should be used for more complex tests.

## Testing for a full match

Both anchors together `pattern:^...$` are often used to test whether or not a string fully matches the pattern. For instance, to check if the user input is in the right format.

Let&#39;s check whether or not a string is a time in `12:34` format. That is: two digits, then a colon, and then another two digits.

In regular expressions language that&#39;s `pattern:\d\d:\d\d`:

```js run
let goodInput = &quot;12:34&quot;;
let badInput = &quot;12:345&quot;;

let regexp = /^\d\d:\d\d$/;
alert(regexp.test(goodInput)); // true
alert(regexp.test(badInput)); // false
```

Here the match for `pattern:\d\d:\d\d` must start exactly after the beginning of the text `pattern:^`, and the end `pattern:$` must immediately follow.

The whole string must be exactly in this format. If there&#39;s any deviation or an extra character, the result is `false`.

Anchors behave differently if flag `pattern:m` is present. We&#39;ll see that in the next article.

```smart header=&quot;Anchors have &quot;zero width&quot;&quot;
Anchors `pattern:^` and `pattern:$` are tests. They have zero width.

In other words, they do not match a character, but rather force the regexp engine to check the condition (text start/end).
```

# Multiline mode of anchors ^ $, flag &quot;m&quot;

The multiline mode is enabled by the flag `pattern:m`.

It only affects the behavior of `pattern:^` and `pattern:$`.

In the multiline mode they match not only at the beginning and the end of the string, but also at start/end of line.

## Searching at line start ^

In the example below the text has multiple lines. The pattern `pattern:/^\d/gm` takes a digit from the beginning of each line:

```js run
let str = `1st place: Winnie
2nd place: Piglet
3rd place: Eeyore`;

*!*
alert( str.match(/^\d/gm) ); // 1, 2, 3
*/!*
```

Without the flag `pattern:m` only the first digit is matched:

```js run
let str = `1st place: Winnie
2nd place: Piglet
3rd place: Eeyore`;

*!*
alert( str.match(/^\d/g) ); // 1
*/!*
```

That&#39;s because by default a caret `pattern:^` only matches at the beginning of the text, and in the multiline mode -- at the start of any line.

```smart
&quot;Start of a line&quot; formally means &quot;immediately after a line break&quot;: the test  `pattern:^` in multiline mode matches at all positions preceded by a newline character `\n`.

And at the text start.
```

## Searching at line end $

The dollar sign `pattern:$` behaves similarly.

The regular expression `pattern:\d$` finds the last digit in every line

```js run
let str = `Winnie: 1
Piglet: 2
Eeyore: 3`;

alert(str.match(/\d$/gm)); // 1,2,3
```

Without the flag `pattern:m`, the dollar `pattern:$` would only match the end of the whole text, so only the very last digit would be found.

```smart
&quot;End of a line&quot; formally means &quot;immediately before a line break&quot;: the test  `pattern:$` in multiline mode matches at all positions succeeded by a newline character `\n`.

And at the text end.
```

## Searching for \n instead of ^ $

To find a newline, we can use not only anchors `pattern:^` and `pattern:$`, but also the newline character `\n`.

What&#39;s the difference? Let&#39;s see an example.

Here we search for `pattern:\d\n` instead of `pattern:\d$`:

```js run
let str = `Winnie: 1
Piglet: 2
Eeyore: 3`;

alert(str.match(/\d\n/gm)); // 1\n,2\n
```

As we can see, there are 2 matches instead of 3.

That&#39;s because there&#39;s no newline after `subject:3` (there&#39;s text end though, so it matches `pattern:$`).

Another difference: now every match includes a newline character `match:\n`. Unlike the anchors `pattern:^` `pattern:$`, that only test the condition (start/end of a line), `\n` is a character, so it becomes a part of the result.

So, a `\n` in the pattern is used when we need newline characters in the result, while anchors are used to find something at the beginning/end of a line.

# Word boundary: \b

A word boundary `pattern:\b` is a test, just like `pattern:^` and `pattern:$`.

When the regexp engine (program module that implements searching for regexps) comes across `pattern:\b`, it checks that the position in the string is a word boundary.

There are three different positions that qualify as word boundaries:

- At string start, if the first string character is a word character `pattern:\w`.
- Between two characters in the string, where one is a word character `pattern:\w` and the other is not.
- At string end, if the last string character is a word character `pattern:\w`.

For instance, regexp `pattern:\bJava\b` will be found in `subject:Hello, Java!`, where `subject:Java` is a standalone word, but not in `subject:Hello, JavaScript!`.

```js run
alert(&quot;Hello, Java!&quot;.match(/\bJava\b/)); // Java
alert(&quot;Hello, JavaScript!&quot;.match(/\bJava\b/)); // null
```

In the string `subject:Hello, Java!` following positions correspond to `pattern:\b`:

![](hello-java-boundaries.svg)

So, it matches the pattern `pattern:\bHello\b`, because:

1. At the beginning of the string matches the first test `pattern:\b`.
2. Then matches the word `pattern:Hello`.
3. Then the test `pattern:\b` matches again, as we&#39;re between `subject:o` and a comma.

So the pattern `pattern:\bHello\b` would match, but not `pattern:\bHell\b` (because there&#39;s no word boundary after `l`) and not `Java!\b` (because the exclamation sign is not a wordly character `pattern:\w`, so there&#39;s no word boundary after it).

```js run
alert(&quot;Hello, Java!&quot;.match(/\bHello\b/)); // Hello
alert(&quot;Hello, Java!&quot;.match(/\bJava\b/)); // Java
alert(&quot;Hello, Java!&quot;.match(/\bHell\b/)); // null (no match)
alert(&quot;Hello, Java!&quot;.match(/\bJava!\b/)); // null (no match)
```

We can use `pattern:\b` not only with words, but with digits as well.

For example, the pattern `pattern:\b\d\d\b` looks for standalone 2-digit numbers. In other words, it looks for 2-digit numbers that are surrounded by characters different from `pattern:\w`, such as spaces or punctuation (or text start/end).

```js run
alert(&quot;1 23 456 78&quot;.match(/\b\d\d\b/g)); // 23,78
alert(&quot;12,34,56&quot;.match(/\b\d\d\b/g)); // 12,34,56
```

```warn header=&quot;Word boundary `pattern:\b`doesn&#39;t work for non-latin alphabets&quot; The word boundary test`pattern:\b`checks that there should be`pattern:\w`on the one side from the position and &quot;not`pattern:\w`&quot; - on the other side.

But `pattern:\w` means a latin letter `a-z` (or a digit or an underscore), so the test doesn&#39;t work for other characters, e.g. cyrillic letters or hieroglyphs.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="escaping-special-characters">Escaping, special characters</h1>
<p>As we’ve seen, a backslash <code>pattern:\</code> is used to denote character classes, e.g. <code>pattern:\d</code>. So it’s a special character in regexps (just like in regular strings).</p>
<p>There are other special characters as well, that have special meaning in a regexp. They are used to do more powerful searches. Here’s a full list of them: <code>pattern:[ \ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )</code>.</p>
<p>Don’t try to remember the list – soon we’ll deal with each of them separately and you’ll know them by heart automatically.</p>
<h2 id="escaping">Escaping</h2>
<p>Let’s say we want to find literally a dot. Not “any character”, but just a dot.</p>
<p>To use a special character as a regular one, prepend it with a backslash: <code>pattern:\.</code>.</p>
<p>That’s also called “escaping a character”.</p>
<p>For example: ```js run alert( “Chapter 5.1”.match(/) ); // 5.1 (match!) alert( “Chapter 511”.match(/) ); // null (looking for a real dot .)</p>
<pre><code>
Parentheses are also special characters, so if we want them, we should use `pattern:\(`. The example below looks for a string `&quot;g()&quot;`:

```js run
alert(&quot;function g()&quot;.match(/g\(\)/)); // &quot;g()&quot;
```

If we&#39;re looking for a backslash `\`, it&#39;s a special character in both regular strings and regexps, so we should double it.

```js run
alert(&quot;1\\2&quot;.match(/\\/)); // &#39;\&#39;
```

## A slash

A slash symbol `&#39;/&#39;` is not a special character, but in JavaScript it is used to open and close the regexp: `pattern:/...pattern.../`, so we should escape it too.

Here&#39;s what a search for a slash `&#39;/&#39;` looks like:

```js run
alert(&quot;/&quot;.match(/\//)); // &#39;/&#39;
```

On the other hand, if we&#39;re not using `pattern:/.../`, but create a regexp using `new RegExp`, then we don&#39;t need to escape it:

```js run
alert(&quot;/&quot;.match(new RegExp(&quot;/&quot;))); // finds /
```

## new RegExp

If we are creating a regular expression with `new RegExp`, then we don&#39;t have to escape `/`, but need to do some other escaping.

For instance, consider this:

```js run
let regexp = new RegExp(&quot;d.d&quot;);

alert(&quot;Chapter 5.1&quot;.match(regexp)); // null
```

The similar search in one of previous examples worked with `pattern:/\d\.\d/`, but `new RegExp(&quot;\d\.\d&quot;)` doesn&#39;t work, why?

The reason is that backslashes are &quot;consumed&quot; by a string. As we may recall, regular strings have their own special characters, such as `\n`, and a backslash is used for escaping.

Here&#39;s how &quot;\d\.\d&quot; is preceived:

```js run
alert(&quot;d.d&quot;); // d.d
```

String quotes &quot;consume&quot; backslashes and interpret them on their own, for instance:

- `\n` -- becomes a newline character,
- `\u1234` -- becomes the Unicode character with such code,
- ...And when there&#39;s no special meaning: like `pattern:\d` or `\z`, then the backslash is simply removed.

So `new RegExp` gets a string without backslashes. That&#39;s why the search doesn&#39;t work!

To fix it, we need to double backslashes, because string quotes turn `\\` into `\`:

```js run
*!*
let regStr = &quot;\\d\\.\\d&quot;;
*/!*
alert(regStr); // \d\.\d (correct now)

let regexp = new RegExp(regStr);

alert( &quot;Chapter 5.1&quot;.match(regexp) ); // 5.1
```

## Summary

- To search for special characters `pattern:[ \ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )` literally, we need to prepend them with a backslash `\` (&quot;escape them&quot;).
- We also need to escape `/` if we&#39;re inside `pattern:/.../` (but not inside `new RegExp`).
- When passing a string to `new RegExp`, we need to double backslashes `\\`, cause string quotes consume one of them.

# Sets and ranges [...]

Several characters or character classes inside square brackets `[…]` mean to &quot;search for any character among given&quot;.

## Sets

For instance, `pattern:[eao]` means any of the 3 characters: `&#39;a&#39;`, `&#39;e&#39;`, or `&#39;o&#39;`.

That&#39;s called a _set_. Sets can be used in a regexp along with regular characters:

```js run
// find [t or m], and then &quot;op&quot;
alert(&quot;Mop top&quot;.match(/[tm]op/gi)); // &quot;Mop&quot;, &quot;top&quot;
```

Please note that although there are multiple characters in the set, they correspond to exactly one character in the match.

So the example below gives no matches:

```js run
// find &quot;V&quot;, then [o or i], then &quot;la&quot;
alert(&quot;Voila&quot;.match(/V[oi]la/)); // null, no matches
```

The pattern searches for:

- `pattern:V`,
- then _one_ of the letters `pattern:[oi]`,
- then `pattern:la`.

So there would be a match for `match:Vola` or `match:Vila`.

## Ranges

Square brackets may also contain _character ranges_.

For instance, `pattern:[a-z]` is a character in range from `a` to `z`, and `pattern:[0-5]` is a digit from `0` to `5`.

In the example below we&#39;re searching for `&quot;x&quot;` followed by two digits or letters from `A` to `F`:

```js run
alert(&quot;Exception 0xAF&quot;.match(/x[0-9A-F][0-9A-F]/g)); // xAF
```

Here `pattern:[0-9A-F]` has two ranges: it searches for a character that is either a digit from `0` to `9` or a letter from `A` to `F`.

If we&#39;d like to look for lowercase letters as well, we can add the range `a-f`: `pattern:[0-9A-Fa-f]`. Or add the flag `pattern:i`.

We can also use character classes inside `[…]`.

For instance, if we&#39;d like to look for a wordly character `pattern:\w` or a hyphen `pattern:-`, then the set is `pattern:[\w-]`.

Combining multiple classes is also possible, e.g. `pattern:[\s\d]` means &quot;a space character or a digit&quot;.

```smart header=&quot;Character classes are shorthands for certain character sets&quot;
For instance:

- **\d** -- is the same as `pattern:[0-9]`,
- **\w** -- is the same as `pattern:[a-zA-Z0-9_]`,
- **\s** -- is the same as `pattern:[\t\n\v\f\r ]`, plus few other rare Unicode space characters.
```

### Example: multi-language \w

As the character class `pattern:\w` is a shorthand for `pattern:[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, it can&#39;t find Chinese hieroglyphs, Cyrillic letters, etc.

We can write a more universal pattern, that looks for wordly characters in any language. That&#39;s easy with Unicode properties: `pattern:[\p{Alpha}\p{M}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}\p{Join_C}]`.

Let&#39;s decipher it. Similar to `pattern:\w`, we&#39;re making a set of our own that includes characters with following Unicode properties:

- `Alphabetic` (`Alpha`) - for letters,
- `Mark` (`M`) - for accents,
- `Decimal_Number` (`Nd`) - for digits,
- `Connector_Punctuation` (`Pc`) - for the underscore `&#39;_&#39;` and similar characters,
- `Join_Control` (`Join_C`) - two special codes `200c` and `200d`, used in ligatures, e.g. in Arabic.

An example of use:

```js run
let regexp = /[\p{Alpha}\p{M}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}\p{Join_C}]/gu;

let str = `Hi 你好 12`;

// finds all letters and digits:
alert(str.match(regexp)); // H,i,你,好,1,2
```

Of course, we can edit this pattern: add Unicode properties or remove them. Unicode properties are covered in more details in the article &lt;info:regexp-unicode&gt;.

```warn header=&quot;Unicode properties aren&#39;t supported in IE&quot;
Unicode properties `pattern:p{…}` are not implemented in IE. If we really need them, we can use library [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/).

Or just use ranges of characters in a language that interests us, e.g.  `pattern:[а-я]` for Cyrillic letters.
```

## Excluding ranges

Besides normal ranges, there are &quot;excluding&quot; ranges that look like `pattern:[^…]`.

They are denoted by a caret character `^` at the start and match any character _except the given ones_.

For instance:

- `pattern:[^aeyo]` -- any character except `&#39;a&#39;`, `&#39;e&#39;`, `&#39;y&#39;` or `&#39;o&#39;`.
- `pattern:[^0-9]` -- any character except a digit, the same as `pattern:\D`.
- `pattern:[^\s]` -- any non-space character, same as `\S`.

The example below looks for any characters except letters, digits and spaces:

```js run
alert(&quot;alice15@gmail.com&quot;.match(/[^\d\sA-Z]/gi)); // @ and .
```

## Escaping in […]

Usually when we want to find exactly a special character, we need to escape it like `pattern:\.`. And if we need a backslash, then we use `pattern:\\`, and so on.

In square brackets we can use the vast majority of special characters without escaping:

- Symbols `pattern:. + ( )` never need escaping.
- A hyphen `pattern:-` is not escaped in the beginning or the end (where it does not define a range).
- A caret `pattern:^` is only escaped in the beginning (where it means exclusion).
- The closing square bracket `pattern:]` is always escaped (if we need to look for that symbol).

In other words, all special characters are allowed without escaping, except when they mean something for square brackets.

A dot `.` inside square brackets means just a dot. The pattern `pattern:[.,]` would look for one of characters: either a dot or a comma.

In the example below the regexp `pattern:[-().^+]` looks for one of the characters `-().^+`:

```js run
// No need to escape
let regexp = /[-().^+]/g;

alert(&quot;1 + 2 - 3&quot;.match(regexp)); // Matches +, -
```

...But if you decide to escape them &quot;just in case&quot;, then there would be no harm:

```js run
// Escaped everything
let regexp = /[\-\(\)\.\^\+]/g;

alert(&quot;1 + 2 - 3&quot;.match(regexp)); // also works: +, -
```

## Ranges and flag &quot;u&quot;

If there are surrogate pairs in the set, flag `pattern:u` is required for them to work correctly.

For instance, let&#39;s look for `pattern:[𝒳𝒴]` in the string `subject:𝒳`:

```js run
alert(&quot;𝒳&quot;.match(/[𝒳𝒴]/)); // shows a strange character, like [?]
// (the search was performed incorrectly, half-character returned)
```

The result is incorrect, because by default regular expressions &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; about surrogate pairs.

The regular expression engine thinks that `[𝒳𝒴]` -- are not two, but four characters:

1. left half of `𝒳` `(1)`,
2. right half of `𝒳` `(2)`,
3. left half of `𝒴` `(3)`,
4. right half of `𝒴` `(4)`.

We can see their codes like this:

```js run
for (let i = 0; i &lt; &quot;𝒳𝒴&quot;.length; i++) {
  alert(&quot;𝒳𝒴&quot;.charCodeAt(i)); // 55349, 56499, 55349, 56500
}
```

So, the example above finds and shows the left half of `𝒳`.

If we add flag `pattern:u`, then the behavior will be correct:

```js run
alert(&quot;𝒳&quot;.match(/[𝒳𝒴]/u)); // 𝒳
```

The similar situation occurs when looking for a range, such as `[𝒳-𝒴]`.

If we forget to add flag `pattern:u`, there will be an error:

```js run
&quot;𝒳&quot;.match(/[𝒳-𝒴]/); // Error: Invalid regular expression
```

The reason is that without flag `pattern:u` surrogate pairs are perceived as two characters, so `[𝒳-𝒴]` is interpreted as `[&lt;55349&gt;&lt;56499&gt;-&lt;55349&gt;&lt;56500&gt;]` (every surrogate pair is replaced with its codes). Now it&#39;s easy to see that the range `56499-55349` is invalid: its starting code `56499` is greater than the end `55349`. That&#39;s the formal reason for the error.

With the flag `pattern:u` the pattern works correctly:

```js run
// look for characters from 𝒳 to 𝒵
alert(&quot;𝒴&quot;.match(/[𝒳-𝒵]/u)); // 𝒴
```

# Quantifiers +, \*, ? and {n}

Let&#39;s say we have a string like `+7(903)-123-45-67` and want to find all numbers in it. But unlike before, we are interested not in single digits, but full numbers: `7, 903, 123, 45, 67`.

A number is a sequence of 1 or more digits `pattern:\d`. To mark how many we need, we can append a _quantifier_.

## Quantity {n}

The simplest quantifier is a number in curly braces: `pattern:{n}`.

A quantifier is appended to a character (or a character class, or a `[...]` set etc) and specifies how many we need.

It has a few advanced forms, let&#39;s see examples:

The exact count: `pattern:{5}`
: `pattern:\d{5}` denotes exactly 5 digits, the same as `pattern:\d\d\d\d\d`.

    The example below looks for a 5-digit number:

    ```js run
    alert( &quot;I&#39;m 12345 years old&quot;.match(/\d{5}/) ); //  &quot;12345&quot;
    ```

    We can add `\b` to exclude longer numbers: `pattern:\b\d{5}\b`.

The range: `pattern:{3,5}`, match 3-5 times
: To find numbers from 3 to 5 digits we can put the limits into curly braces: `pattern:\d{3,5}`

    ```js run
    alert( &quot;I&#39;m not 12, but 1234 years old&quot;.match(/\d{3,5}/) ); // &quot;1234&quot;
    ```

    We can omit the upper limit.

    Then a regexp `pattern:\d{3,}` looks for sequences of digits of length `3` or more:

    ```js run
    alert( &quot;I&#39;m not 12, but 345678 years old&quot;.match(/\d{3,}/) ); // &quot;345678&quot;
    ```

Let&#39;s return to the string `+7(903)-123-45-67`.

A number is a sequence of one or more digits in a row. So the regexp is `pattern:\d{1,}`:

```js run
let str = &quot;+7(903)-123-45-67&quot;;

let numbers = str.match(/\d{1,}/g);

alert(numbers); // 7,903,123,45,67
```

## Shorthands

There are shorthands for most used quantifiers:

`pattern:+`
: Means &quot;one or more&quot;, the same as `pattern:{1,}`.

    For instance, `pattern:\d+` looks for numbers:

    ```js run
    let str = &quot;+7(903)-123-45-67&quot;;

    alert( str.match(/\d+/g) ); // 7,903,123,45,67
    ```

`pattern:?`
: Means &quot;zero or one&quot;, the same as `pattern:{0,1}`. In other words, it makes the symbol optional.

    For instance, the pattern `pattern:ou?r` looks for `match:o` followed by zero or one `match:u`, and then `match:r`.

    So, `pattern:colou?r` finds both `match:color` and `match:colour`:

    ```js run
    let str = &quot;Should I write color or colour?&quot;;

    alert( str.match(/colou?r/g) ); // color, colour
    ```

`pattern:*`
: Means &quot;zero or more&quot;, the same as `pattern:{0,}`. That is, the character may repeat any times or be absent.

    For example, `pattern:\d0*` looks for a digit followed by any number of zeroes (may be many or none):

    ```js run
    alert( &quot;100 10 1&quot;.match(/\d0*/g) ); // 100, 10, 1
    ```

    Compare it with `pattern:+` (one or more):

    ```js run
    alert( &quot;100 10 1&quot;.match(/\d0+/g) ); // 100, 10
    // 1 not matched, as 0+ requires at least one zero
    ```

## More examples

Quantifiers are used very often. They serve as the main &quot;building block&quot; of complex regular expressions, so let&#39;s see more examples.

**Regexp for decimal fractions (a number with a floating point): `pattern:\d+\.\d+`**

In action:

```js run
alert(&quot;0 1 12.345 7890&quot;.match(/\d+\.\d+/g)); // 12.345
```

**Regexp for an &quot;opening HTML-tag without attributes&quot;, such as `&lt;span&gt;` or `&lt;p&gt;`.**

1. The simplest one: `pattern:/&lt;[a-z]+&gt;/i`

   ```js run
   alert(&quot;&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt;&quot;.match(/&lt;[a-z]+&gt;/gi)); // &lt;body&gt;
   ```

   The regexp looks for character `pattern:&#39;&lt;&#39;` followed by one or more Latin letters, and then `pattern:&#39;&gt;&#39;`.

2. Improved: `pattern:/&lt;[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;/i`

   According to the standard, HTML tag name may have a digit at any position except the first one, like `&lt;h1&gt;`.

   ```js run
   alert(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hi!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.match(/&lt;[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;/gi)); // &lt;h1&gt;
   ```

**Regexp &quot;opening or closing HTML-tag without attributes&quot;: `pattern:/&lt;\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;/i`**

We added an optional slash `pattern:/?` near the beginning of the pattern. Had to escape it with a backslash, otherwise JavaScript would think it is the pattern end.

```js run
alert(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hi!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.match(/&lt;\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;/gi)); // &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;/h1&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;To make a regexp more precise, we often need make it more complex&quot;
We can see one common rule in these examples: the more precise is the regular expression -- the longer and more complex it is.

For instance, for HTML tags we could use a simpler regexp: `pattern:&lt;\w+&gt;`. But as HTML has stricter restrictions for a tag name, `pattern:&lt;[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;` is more reliable.

Can we use `pattern:&lt;\w+&gt;` or we need `pattern:&lt;[a-z][a-z0-9]*&gt;`?

In real life both variants are acceptable. Depends on how tolerant we can be to &quot;extra&quot; matches and whether it&#39;s difficult or not to remove them from the result by other means.
```

# Greedy and lazy quantifiers

Quantifiers are very simple from the first sight, but in fact they can be tricky.

We should understand how the search works very well if we plan to look for something more complex than `pattern:/\d+/`.

Let&#39;s take the following task as an example.

We have a text and need to replace all quotes `&quot;...&quot;` with guillemet marks: `«...»`. They are preferred for typography in many countries.

For instance: `&quot;Hello, world&quot;` should become `«Hello, world»`. There exist other quotes, such as `„Witam, świat!”` (Polish) or `「你好，世界」` (Chinese), but for our task let&#39;s choose `«...»`.

The first thing to do is to locate quoted strings, and then we can replace them.

A regular expression like `pattern:/&quot;.+&quot;/g` (a quote, then something, then the other quote) may seem like a good fit, but it isn&#39;t!

Let&#39;s try it:

```js run
let regexp = /&quot;.+&quot;/g;

let str = &#39;a &quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot; is one&#39;;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // &quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot;
```

...We can see that it works not as intended!

Instead of finding two matches `match:&quot;witch&quot;` and `match:&quot;broom&quot;`, it finds one: `match:&quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot;`.

That can be described as &quot;greediness is the cause of all evil&quot;.

## Greedy search

To find a match, the regular expression engine uses the following algorithm:

- For every position in the string
  - Try to match the pattern at that position.
  - If there&#39;s no match, go to the next position.

These common words do not make it obvious why the regexp fails, so let&#39;s elaborate how the search works for the pattern `pattern:&quot;.+&quot;`.

1. The first pattern character is a quote `pattern:&quot;`.

   The regular expression engine tries to find it at the zero position of the source string `subject:a &quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot; is one`, but there&#39;s `subject:a` there, so there&#39;s immediately no match.

   Then it advances: goes to the next positions in the source string and tries to find the first character of the pattern there, fails again, and finally finds the quote at the 3rd position:

   ![](witch_greedy1.svg)

2. The quote is detected, and then the engine tries to find a match for the rest of the pattern. It tries to see if the rest of the subject string conforms to `pattern:.+&quot;`.

   In our case the next pattern character is `pattern:.` (a dot). It denotes &quot;any character except a newline&quot;, so the next string letter `match:&#39;w&#39;` fits:

   ![](witch_greedy2.svg)

3. Then the dot repeats because of the quantifier `pattern:.+`. The regular expression engine adds to the match one character after another.

   ...Until when? All characters match the dot, so it only stops when it reaches the end of the string:

   ![](witch_greedy3.svg)

4. Now the engine finished repeating `pattern:.+` and tries to find the next character of the pattern. It&#39;s the quote `pattern:&quot;`. But there&#39;s a problem: the string has finished, there are no more characters!

   The regular expression engine understands that it took too many `pattern:.+` and starts to _backtrack_.

   In other words, it shortens the match for the quantifier by one character:

   ![](witch_greedy4.svg)

   Now it assumes that `pattern:.+` ends one character before the string end and tries to match the rest of the pattern from that position.

   If there were a quote there, then the search would end, but the last character is `subject:&#39;e&#39;`, so there&#39;s no match.

5. ...So the engine decreases the number of repetitions of `pattern:.+` by one more character:

   ![](witch_greedy5.svg)

   The quote `pattern:&#39;&quot;&#39;` does not match `subject:&#39;n&#39;`.

6. The engine keep backtracking: it decreases the count of repetition for `pattern:&#39;.&#39;` until the rest of the pattern (in our case `pattern:&#39;&quot;&#39;`) matches:

   ![](witch_greedy6.svg)

7. The match is complete.

8. So the first match is `match:&quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot;`. If the regular expression has flag `pattern:g`, then the search will continue from where the first match ends. There are no more quotes in the rest of the string `subject:is one`, so no more results.

That&#39;s probably not what we expected, but that&#39;s how it works.

**In the greedy mode (by default) a quantified character is repeated as many times as possible.**

The regexp engine adds to the match as many characters as it can for `pattern:.+`, and then shortens that one by one, if the rest of the pattern doesn&#39;t match.

For our task we want another thing. That&#39;s where a lazy mode can help.

## Lazy mode

The lazy mode of quantifiers is an opposite to the greedy mode. It means: &quot;repeat minimal number of times&quot;.

We can enable it by putting a question mark `pattern:&#39;?&#39;` after the quantifier, so that it becomes `pattern:*?` or `pattern:+?` or even `pattern:??` for `pattern:&#39;?&#39;`.

To make things clear: usually a question mark `pattern:?` is a quantifier by itself (zero or one), but if added _after another quantifier (or even itself)_ it gets another meaning -- it switches the matching mode from greedy to lazy.

The regexp `pattern:/&quot;.+?&quot;/g` works as intended: it finds `match:&quot;witch&quot;` and `match:&quot;broom&quot;`:

```js run
let regexp = /&quot;.+?&quot;/g;

let str = &#39;a &quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot; is one&#39;;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // &quot;witch&quot;, &quot;broom&quot;
```

To clearly understand the change, let&#39;s trace the search step by step.

1. The first step is the same: it finds the pattern start `pattern:&#39;&quot;&#39;` at the 3rd position:

   ![](witch_greedy1.svg)

2. The next step is also similar: the engine finds a match for the dot `pattern:&#39;.&#39;`:

   ![](witch_greedy2.svg)

3. And now the search goes differently. Because we have a lazy mode for `pattern:+?`, the engine doesn&#39;t try to match a dot one more time, but stops and tries to match the rest of the pattern `pattern:&#39;&quot;&#39;` right now:

   ![](witch_lazy3.svg)

   If there were a quote there, then the search would end, but there&#39;s `&#39;i&#39;`, so there&#39;s no match.

4. Then the regular expression engine increases the number of repetitions for the dot and tries one more time:

   ![](witch_lazy4.svg)

   Failure again. Then the number of repetitions is increased again and again...

5. ...Till the match for the rest of the pattern is found:

   ![](witch_lazy5.svg)

6. The next search starts from the end of the current match and yield one more result:

   ![](witch_lazy6.svg)

In this example we saw how the lazy mode works for `pattern:+?`. Quantifiers `pattern:*?` and `pattern:??` work the similar way -- the regexp engine increases the number of repetitions only if the rest of the pattern can&#39;t match on the given position.

**Laziness is only enabled for the quantifier with `?`.**

Other quantifiers remain greedy.

For instance:

```js run
alert(&quot;123 456&quot;.match(/\d+ \d+?/)); // 123 4
```

1. The pattern `pattern:\d+` tries to match as many digits as it can (greedy mode), so it finds `match:123` and stops, because the next character is a space `pattern:&#39; &#39;`.
2. Then there&#39;s a space in the pattern, it matches.
3. Then there&#39;s `pattern:\d+?`. The quantifier is in lazy mode, so it finds one digit `match:4` and tries to check if the rest of the pattern matches from there.

   ...But there&#39;s nothing in the pattern after `pattern:\d+?`.

   The lazy mode doesn&#39;t repeat anything without a need. The pattern finished, so we&#39;re done. We have a match `match:123 4`.

```smart header=&quot;Optimizations&quot;
Modern regular expression engines can optimize internal algorithms to work faster. So they may work a bit differently from the described algorithm.

But to understand how regular expressions work and to build regular expressions, we don&#39;t need to know about that. They are only used internally to optimize things.

Complex regular expressions are hard to optimize, so the search may work exactly as described as well.
```

## Alternative approach

With regexps, there&#39;s often more than one way to do the same thing.

In our case we can find quoted strings without lazy mode using the regexp `pattern:&quot;[^&quot;]+&quot;`:

```js run
let regexp = /&quot;[^&quot;]+&quot;/g;

let str = &#39;a &quot;witch&quot; and her &quot;broom&quot; is one&#39;;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // &quot;witch&quot;, &quot;broom&quot;
```

The regexp `pattern:&quot;[^&quot;]+&quot;` gives correct results, because it looks for a quote `pattern:&#39;&quot;&#39;` followed by one or more non-quotes `pattern:[^&quot;]`, and then the closing quote.

When the regexp engine looks for `pattern:[^&quot;]+` it stops the repetitions when it meets the closing quote, and we&#39;re done.

Please note, that this logic does not replace lazy quantifiers!

It is just different. There are times when we need one or another.

**Let&#39;s see an example where lazy quantifiers fail and this variant works right.**

For instance, we want to find links of the form `&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;`, with any `href`.

Which regular expression to use?

The first idea might be: `pattern:/&lt;a href=&quot;.*&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g`.

Let&#39;s check it:

```js run
let str = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let regexp = /&lt;a href=&quot;.*&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g;

// Works!
alert(str.match(regexp)); // &lt;a href=&quot;link&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
```

It worked. But let&#39;s see what happens if there are many links in the text?

```js run
let str = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let regexp = /&lt;a href=&quot;.*&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g;

// Whoops! Two links in one match!
alert(str.match(regexp)); // &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
```

Now the result is wrong for the same reason as our &quot;witches&quot; example. The quantifier `pattern:.*` took too many characters.

The match looks like this:

```html
&lt;a href=&quot;.....................................&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
```

Let&#39;s modify the pattern by making the quantifier `pattern:.*?` lazy:

```js run
let str = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let regexp = /&lt;a href=&quot;.*?&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g;

// Works!
alert(str.match(regexp)); // &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
```

Now it seems to work, there are two matches:

```html
&lt;a href=&quot;.....&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;.....&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
```

...But let&#39;s test it on one more text input:

```js run
let str = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;wrong&quot;&gt;... &lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let regexp = /&lt;a href=&quot;.*?&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g;

// Wrong match!
alert(str.match(regexp)); // &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;wrong&quot;&gt;... &lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
```

Now it fails. The match includes not just a link, but also a lot of text after it, including `&lt;p...&gt;`.

Why?

That&#39;s what&#39;s going on:

1. First the regexp finds a link start `match:&lt;a href=&quot;`.
2. Then it looks for `pattern:.*?`: takes one character (lazily!), check if there&#39;s a match for `pattern:&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;` (none).
3. Then takes another character into `pattern:.*?`, and so on... until it finally reaches `match:&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;`.

But the problem is: that&#39;s already beyond the link `&lt;a...&gt;`, in another tag `&lt;p&gt;`. Not what we want.

Here&#39;s the picture of the match aligned with the text:

```html
&lt;a href=&quot;...................................&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;wrong&quot;
    &gt;...
    &lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
```

So, we need the pattern to look for `&lt;a href=&quot;...something...&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;`, but both greedy and lazy variants have problems.

The correct variant can be: `pattern:href=&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;`. It will take all characters inside the `href` attribute till the nearest quote, just what we need.

A working example:

```js run
let str1 = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;wrong&quot;&gt;... &lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let str2 = &#39;...&lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;... &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;...&#39;;
let regexp = /&lt;a href=&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;/g;

// Works!
alert(str1.match(regexp)); // null, no matches, that&#39;s correct
alert(str2.match(regexp)); // &lt;a href=&quot;link1&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;link2&quot; class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;
```

## Summary

Quantifiers have two modes of work:

Greedy
: By default the regular expression engine tries to repeat the quantified character as many times as possible. For instance, `pattern:\d+` consumes all possible digits. When it becomes impossible to consume more (no more digits or string end), then it continues to match the rest of the pattern. If there&#39;s no match then it decreases the number of repetitions (backtracks) and tries again.

Lazy
: Enabled by the question mark `pattern:?` after the quantifier. The regexp engine tries to match the rest of the pattern before each repetition of the quantified character.

As we&#39;ve seen, the lazy mode is not a &quot;panacea&quot; from the greedy search. An alternative is a &quot;fine-tuned&quot; greedy search, with exclusions, as in the pattern `pattern:&quot;[^&quot;]+&quot;`.

# Capturing groups

A part of a pattern can be enclosed in parentheses `pattern:(...)`. This is called a &quot;capturing group&quot;.

That has two effects:

1. It allows to get a part of the match as a separate item in the result array.
2. If we put a quantifier after the parentheses, it applies to the parentheses as a whole.

## Examples

Let&#39;s see how parentheses work in examples.

### Example: gogogo

Without parentheses, the pattern `pattern:go+` means `subject:g` character, followed by `subject:o` repeated one or more times. For instance, `match:goooo` or `match:gooooooooo`.

Parentheses group characters together, so `pattern:(go)+` means `match:go`, `match:gogo`, `match:gogogo` and so on.

```js run
alert(&quot;Gogogo now!&quot;.match(/(go)+/gi)); // &quot;Gogogo&quot;
```

### Example: domain

Let&#39;s make something more complex -- a regular expression to search for a website domain.

For example:

```
mail.com
users.mail.com
smith.users.mail.com
```

As we can see, a domain consists of repeated words, a dot after each one except the last one.

In regular expressions that&#39;s `pattern:(\w+\.)+\w+`:

```js run
let regexp = /(\w+\.)+\w+/g;

alert(&quot;site.com my.site.com&quot;.match(regexp)); // site.com,my.site.com
```

The search works, but the pattern can&#39;t match a domain with a hyphen, e.g. `my-site.com`, because the hyphen does not belong to class `pattern:\w`.

We can fix it by replacing `pattern:\w` with `pattern:[\w-]` in every word except the last one: `pattern:([\w-]+\.)+\w+`.

### Example: email

The previous example can be extended. We can create a regular expression for emails based on it.

The email format is: `name@domain`. Any word can be the name, hyphens and dots are allowed. In regular expressions that&#39;s `pattern:[-.\w]+`.

The pattern:

```js run
let regexp = /[-.\w]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]+/g;

alert(&quot;my@mail.com @ his@site.com.uk&quot;.match(regexp)); // my@mail.com, his@site.com.uk
```

That regexp is not perfect, but mostly works and helps to fix accidental mistypes. The only truly reliable check for an email can only be done by sending a letter.

## Parentheses contents in the match

Parentheses are numbered from left to right. The search engine memorizes the content matched by each of them and allows to get it in the result.

The method `str.match(regexp)`, if `regexp` has no flag `g`, looks for the first match and returns it as an array:

1. At index `0`: the full match.
2. At index `1`: the contents of the first parentheses.
3. At index `2`: the contents of the second parentheses.
4. ...and so on...

For instance, we&#39;d like to find HTML tags `pattern:&lt;.*?&gt;`, and process them. It would be convenient to have tag content (what&#39;s inside the angles), in a separate variable.

Let&#39;s wrap the inner content into parentheses, like this: `pattern:&lt;(.*?)&gt;`.

Now we&#39;ll get both the tag as a whole `match:&lt;h1&gt;` and its contents `match:h1` in the resulting array:

```js run
let str = &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;;

let tag = str.match(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/);

alert(tag[0]); // &lt;h1&gt;
alert(tag[1]); // h1
```

### Nested groups

Parentheses can be nested. In this case the numbering also goes from left to right.

For instance, when searching a tag in `subject:&lt;span class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;` we may be interested in:

1. The tag content as a whole: `match:span class=&quot;my&quot;`.
2. The tag name: `match:span`.
3. The tag attributes: `match:class=&quot;my&quot;`.

Let&#39;s add parentheses for them: `pattern:&lt;(([a-z]+)\s*([^&gt;]*))&gt;`.

Here&#39;s how they are numbered (left to right, by the opening paren):

![](regexp-nested-groups-pattern.svg)

In action:

```js run
let str = &#39;&lt;span class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;&#39;;

let regexp = /&lt;(([a-z]+)\s*([^&gt;]*))&gt;/;

let result = str.match(regexp);
alert(result[0]); // &lt;span class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;
alert(result[1]); // span class=&quot;my&quot;
alert(result[2]); // span
alert(result[3]); // class=&quot;my&quot;
```

The zero index of `result` always holds the full match.

Then groups, numbered from left to right by an opening paren. The first group is returned as `result[1]`. Here it encloses the whole tag content.

Then in `result[2]` goes the group from the second opening paren `pattern:([a-z]+)` - tag name, then in `result[3]` the tag: `pattern:([^&gt;]*)`.

The contents of every group in the string:

![](regexp-nested-groups-matches.svg)

### Optional groups

Even if a group is optional and doesn&#39;t exist in the match (e.g. has the quantifier `pattern:(...)?`), the corresponding `result` array item is present and equals `undefined`.

For instance, let&#39;s consider the regexp `pattern:a(z)?(c)?`. It looks for `&quot;a&quot;` optionally followed by `&quot;z&quot;` optionally followed by `&quot;c&quot;`.

If we run it on the string with a single letter `subject:a`, then the result is:

```js run
let match = &quot;a&quot;.match(/a(z)?(c)?/);

alert(match.length); // 3
alert(match[0]); // a (whole match)
alert(match[1]); // undefined
alert(match[2]); // undefined
```

The array has the length of `3`, but all groups are empty.

And here&#39;s a more complex match for the string `subject:ac`:

```js run
let match = &quot;ac&quot;.match(/a(z)?(c)?/);

alert(match.length); // 3
alert(match[0]); // ac (whole match)
alert(match[1]); // undefined, because there&#39;s nothing for (z)?
alert(match[2]); // c
```

The array length is permanent: `3`. But there&#39;s nothing for the group `pattern:(z)?`, so the result is `[&quot;ac&quot;, undefined, &quot;c&quot;]`.

## Searching for all matches with groups: matchAll

```warn header=&quot;`matchAll`is a new method, polyfill may be needed&quot; The method`matchAll` is not supported in old browsers.

A polyfill may be required, such as &lt;https://github.com/ljharb/String.prototype.matchAll&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>When we search for all matches (flag <code>pattern:g</code>), the <code>match</code> method does not return contents for groups.</p>
<p>For example, let’s find all tags in a string:</p>
```js run let str = ’
<h1>
<h2>
<p>’;</p>
<p>let tags = str.match(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/g);</p>
alert( tags ); //
<h1>
,
<h2>
<pre><code>
The result is an array of matches, but without details about each of them. But in practice we usually need contents of capturing groups in the result.

To get them, we should search using the method `str.matchAll(regexp)`.

It was added to JavaScript language long after `match`, as its &quot;new and improved version&quot;.

Just like `match`, it looks for matches, but there are 3 differences:

1. It returns not an array, but an iterable object.
2. When the flag `pattern:g` is present, it returns every match as an array with groups.
3. If there are no matches, it returns not `null`, but an empty iterable object.

For instance:

```js run
let results = &quot;&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&quot;.matchAll(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/gi);

// results - is not an array, but an iterable object
alert(results); // [object RegExp String Iterator]

alert(results[0]); // undefined (*)

results = Array.from(results); // let&#39;s turn it into array

alert(results[0]); // &lt;h1&gt;,h1 (1st tag)
alert(results[1]); // &lt;h2&gt;,h2 (2nd tag)
```

As we can see, the first difference is very important, as demonstrated in the line `(*)`. We can&#39;t get the match as `results[0]`, because that object isn&#39;t pseudoarray. We can turn it into a real `Array` using `Array.from`. There are more details about pseudoarrays and iterables in the article &lt;info:iterable&gt;.

There&#39;s no need in `Array.from` if we&#39;re looping over results:

```js run
let results = &quot;&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&quot;.matchAll(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/gi);

for (let result of results) {
  alert(result);
  // first alert: &lt;h1&gt;,h1
  // second: &lt;h2&gt;,h2
}
```

...Or using destructuring:

```js
let [tag1, tag2] = &quot;&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&quot;.matchAll(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/gi);
```

Every match, returned by `matchAll`, has the same format as returned by `match` without flag `pattern:g`: it&#39;s an array with additional properties `index` (match index in the string) and `input` (source string):

```js run
let results = &quot;&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&quot;.matchAll(/&lt;(.*?)&gt;/gi);

let [tag1, tag2] = results;

alert(tag1[0]); // &lt;h1&gt;
alert(tag1[1]); // h1
alert(tag1.index); // 0
alert(tag1.input); // &lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;
```

```smart header=&quot;Why is a result of `matchAll` an iterable object, not an array?&quot;
Why is the method designed like that? The reason is simple - for the optimization.

The call to `matchAll` does not perform the search. Instead, it returns an iterable object, without the results initially. The search is performed each time we iterate over it, e.g. in the loop.

So, there will be found as many results as needed, not more.

E.g. there are potentially 100 matches in the text, but in a `for..of` loop we found 5 of them, then decided it&#39;s enough and made a `break`. Then the engine won&#39;t spend time finding other 95 matches.

<p>Remembering groups by their numbers is hard. For simple patterns it’s doable, but for more complex ones counting parentheses is inconvenient. We have a much better option: give names to parentheses.</p>
<p>That’s done by putting <code>pattern:?&lt;name&gt;</code> immediately after the opening paren.</p>
<p>For example, let’s look for a date in the format “year-month-day”:</p>
<p>```js run <em>!</em> let dateRegexp = /(?<year>[0-9]{4})-(?<month>[0-9]{2})-(?<day>[0-9]{2})/; <em>/!</em> let str = “2019-04-30”;</p>
<p>let groups = str.match(dateRegexp).groups;</p>
<p>alert(groups.year); // 2019 alert(groups.month); // 04 alert(groups.day); // 30</p>
<pre><code>
As you can see, the groups reside in the `.groups` property of the match.

To look for all dates, we can add flag `pattern:g`.

We&#39;ll also need `matchAll` to obtain full matches, together with groups:

```js run
let dateRegexp = /(?&lt;year&gt;[0-9]{4})-(?&lt;month&gt;[0-9]{2})-(?&lt;day&gt;[0-9]{2})/g;

let str = &quot;2019-10-30 2020-01-01&quot;;

let results = str.matchAll(dateRegexp);

for (let result of results) {
  let { year, month, day } = result.groups;

  alert(`${day}.${month}.${year}`);
  // first alert: 30.10.2019
  // second: 01.01.2020
}
```

## Capturing groups in replacement

Method `str.replace(regexp, replacement)` that replaces all matches with `regexp` in `str` allows to use parentheses contents in the `replacement` string. That&#39;s done using `pattern:$n`, where `pattern:n` is the group number.

For example,

```js run
let str = &quot;John Bull&quot;;
let regexp = /(\w+) (\w+)/;

alert(str.replace(regexp, &quot;$2, $1&quot;)); // Bull, John
```

For named parentheses the reference will be `pattern:$&lt;name&gt;`.

For example, let&#39;s reformat dates from &quot;year-month-day&quot; to &quot;day.month.year&quot;:

```js run
let regexp = /(?&lt;year&gt;[0-9]{4})-(?&lt;month&gt;[0-9]{2})-(?&lt;day&gt;[0-9]{2})/g;

let str = &quot;2019-10-30, 2020-01-01&quot;;

alert(str.replace(regexp, &quot;$&lt;day&gt;.$&lt;month&gt;.$&lt;year&gt;&quot;));
// 30.10.2019, 01.01.2020
```

## Non-capturing groups with ?:

Sometimes we need parentheses to correctly apply a quantifier, but we don&#39;t want their contents in results.

A group may be excluded by adding `pattern:?:` in the beginning.

For instance, if we want to find `pattern:(go)+`, but don&#39;t want the parentheses contents (`go`) as a separate array item, we can write: `pattern:(?:go)+`.

In the example below we only get the name `match:John` as a separate member of the match:

```js run
let str = &quot;Gogogo John!&quot;;

*!*
// ?: exludes &#39;go&#39; from capturing
let regexp = /(?:go)+ (\w+)/i;
*/!*

let result = str.match(regexp);

alert( result[0] ); // Gogogo John (full match)
alert( result[1] ); // John
alert( result.length ); // 2 (no more items in the array)
```

## Summary

Parentheses group together a part of the regular expression, so that the quantifier applies to it as a whole.

Parentheses groups are numbered left-to-right, and can optionally be named with `(?&lt;name&gt;...)`.

The content, matched by a group, can be obtained in the results:

- The method `str.match` returns capturing groups only without flag `pattern:g`.
- The method `str.matchAll` always returns capturing groups.

If the parentheses have no name, then their contents is available in the match array by its number. Named parentheses are also available in the property `groups`.

We can also use parentheses contents in the replacement string in `str.replace`: by the number `$n` or the name `$&lt;name&gt;`.

A group may be excluded from numbering by adding `pattern:?:` in its start. That&#39;s used when we need to apply a quantifier to the whole group, but don&#39;t want it as a separate item in the results array. We also can&#39;t reference such parentheses in the replacement string.

# Backreferences in pattern: \N and \k&lt;name&gt;

We can use the contents of capturing groups `pattern:(...)` not only in the result or in the replacement string, but also in the pattern itself.

## Backreference by number: \N

A group can be referenced in the pattern using `pattern:\N`, where `N` is the group number.

To make clear why that&#39;s helpful, let&#39;s consider a task.

We need to find quoted strings: either single-quoted `subject:&#39;...&#39;` or a double-quoted `subject:&quot;...&quot;` -- both variants should match.

How to find them?

We can put both kinds of quotes in the square brackets: `pattern:[&#39;&quot;](.*?)[&#39;&quot;]`, but it would find strings with mixed quotes, like `match:&quot;...&#39;` and `match:&#39;...&quot;`. That would lead to incorrect matches when one quote appears inside other ones, like in the string `subject:&quot;She&#39;s the one!&quot;`:

```js run
let str = `He said: &quot;She&#39;s the one!&quot;.`;

let regexp = /[&#39;&quot;](.*?)[&#39;&quot;]/g;

// The result is not what we&#39;d like to have
alert(str.match(regexp)); // &quot;She&#39;
```

As we can see, the pattern found an opening quote `match:&quot;`, then the text is consumed till the other quote `match:&#39;`, that closes the match.

To make sure that the pattern looks for the closing quote exactly the same as the opening one, we can wrap it into a capturing group and backreference it: `pattern:([&#39;&quot;])(.*?)\1`.

Here&#39;s the correct code:

```js run
let str = `He said: &quot;She&#39;s the one!&quot;.`;

*!*
let regexp = /([&#39;&quot;])(.*?)\1/g;
*/!*

alert( str.match(regexp) ); // &quot;She&#39;s the one!&quot;
```

Now it works! The regular expression engine finds the first quote `pattern:([&#39;&quot;])` and memorizes its content. That&#39;s the first capturing group.

Further in the pattern `pattern:\1` means &quot;find the same text as in the first group&quot;, exactly the same quote in our case.

Similar to that, `pattern:\2` would mean the contents of the second group, `pattern:\3` - the 3rd group, and so on.

```smart
If we use `?:` in the group, then we can&#39;t reference it. Groups that are excluded from capturing `(?:...)` are not memorized by the engine.
```

```warn header=&quot;Don&#39;t mess up: in the pattern `pattern:\1`, in the replacement: `pattern:$1`&quot; In the replacement string we use a dollar sign: `pattern:$1`, while in the pattern - a backslash `pattern:\1`.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="backreference-by-name-kname">Backreference by name: <code>\k&lt;name&gt;</code></h2>
<p>If a regexp has many parentheses, it’s convenient to give them names.</p>
<p>To reference a named group we can use <code>pattern:\k&lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In the example below the group with quotes is named <code>pattern:?&lt;quote&gt;</code>, so the backreference is <code>pattern:\k&lt;quote&gt;</code>:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let str =</code>He said: “She’s the one!”.`;</p>
<p><em>!</em> let regexp = /(?<quote>[’"])(.<em>?)quote&gt;/g; </em>/!*</p>
<p>alert( str.match(regexp) ); // “She’s the one!” ````</p>
<h1 id="alternation-or">Alternation (OR) |</h1>
<p>Alternation is the term in regular expression that is actually a simple “OR”.</p>
<p>In a regular expression it is denoted with a vertical line character <code>pattern:|</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, we need to find programming languages: HTML, PHP, Java or JavaScript.</p>
<p>The corresponding regexp: <code>pattern:html|php|java(script)?</code>.</p>
<p>A usage example:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /html|php|css|java(script)?/gi;</p>
<p>let str = “First HTML appeared, then CSS, then JavaScript”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // ‘HTML’, ‘CSS’, ‘JavaScript’</p>
<pre><code>
We already saw a similar thing -- square brackets. They allow to choose between multiple characters, for instance `pattern:gr[ae]y` matches `match:gray` or `match:grey`.

Square brackets allow only characters or character classes. Alternation allows any expressions. A regexp `pattern:A|B|C` means one of expressions `A`, `B` or `C`.

For instance:

- `pattern:gr(a|e)y` means exactly the same as `pattern:gr[ae]y`.
- `pattern:gra|ey` means `match:gra` or `match:ey`.

To apply alternation to a chosen part of the pattern, we can enclose it in parentheses:

- `pattern:I love HTML|CSS` matches `match:I love HTML` or `match:CSS`.
- `pattern:I love (HTML|CSS)` matches `match:I love HTML` or `match:I love CSS`.

## Example: regexp for time

In previous articles there was a task to build a regexp for searching time in the form `hh:mm`, for instance `12:00`. But a simple `pattern:\d\d:\d\d` is too vague. It accepts `25:99` as the time (as 99 minutes match the pattern, but that time is invalid).

How can we make a better pattern?

We can use more careful matching. First, the hours:

- If the first digit is `0` or `1`, then the next digit can be any: `pattern:[01]\d`.
- Otherwise, if the first digit is `2`, then the next must be `pattern:[0-3]`.
- (no other first digit is allowed)

We can write both variants in a regexp using alternation: `pattern:[01]\d|2[0-3]`.

Next, minutes must be from `00` to `59`. In the regular expression language that can be written as `pattern:[0-5]\d`: the first digit `0-5`, and then any digit.

If we glue hours and minutes together, we get the pattern: `pattern:[01]\d|2[0-3]:[0-5]\d`.

We&#39;re almost done, but there&#39;s a problem. The alternation `pattern:|` now happens to be between `pattern:[01]\d` and `pattern:2[0-3]:[0-5]\d`.

That is: minutes are added to the second alternation variant, here&#39;s a clear picture:
</code></pre>
<p>[01] 2[0-3]:[0-5]``</p>
<p>That pattern looks for <code>pattern:[01]\d</code> or <code>pattern:2[0-3]:[0-5]\d</code>.</p>
<p>But that’s wrong, the alternation should only be used in the “hours” part of the regular expression, to allow <code>pattern:[01]\d</code> OR <code>pattern:2[0-3]</code>. Let’s correct that by enclosing “hours” into parentheses: <code>pattern:([01]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d</code>.</p>
<p>The final solution:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /([01]2[0-3]):[0-5]g;</p>
<p>alert(“00:00 10:10 23:59 25:99 1:2”.match(regexp)); // 00:00,10:10,23:59 ```</p>
<h1 id="loops-while-and-for">Loops: while and for</h1>
<p>We often need to repeat actions.</p>
<p>For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.</p>
<p><em>Loops</em> are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.</p>
<h2 id="the-while-loop">The “while” loop</h2>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop has the following syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb76"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-1" title="1"><span class="cf">while</span> (condition) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// code</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-3" title="3">  <span class="co">// so-called &quot;loop body&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>While the <code>condition</code> is truthy, the <code>code</code> from the loop body is executed.</p>
<p>For instance, the loop below outputs <code>i</code> while <code>i &lt; 3</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run let i = 0; while (i &lt; 3) {   // shows 0, then 1, then 2   alert(i);   i++; }</code></p>
<p>A single execution of the loop body is called <em>an iteration</em>. The loop in the example above makes three iterations.</p>
<p>If <code>i++</code> was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever. In practice, the browser provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript, we can kill the process.</p>
<p>Any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and converted to a boolean by <code>while</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, a shorter way to write <code>while (i != 0)</code> is <code>while (i)</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run let i = 3; *!* while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops */!*   alert( i );   i--; }</code></p>
<p>```<code>smart header="Curly braces are not required for a single-line body" If the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the curly braces</code>{…}`:</p>
<p><code>js run let i = 3; *!* while (i) alert(i--); */!*</code> ````</p>
<h2 id="the-do..while-loop">The “do..while” loop</h2>
<p>The condition check can be moved <em>below</em> the loop body using the <code>do..while</code> syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb77"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb77-1" title="1"><span class="cf">do</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb77-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// loop body</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb77-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">while</span> (condition)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it’s truthy, execute it again and again.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>js run let i = 0; do {   alert(i);   i++; } while (i &lt; 3);</code></p>
<p>This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute <strong>at least once</strong> regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred: <code>while(…) {…}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-for-loop">The “for” loop</h2>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb78"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb78-1" title="1"><span class="cf">for</span> (begin<span class="op">;</span> condition<span class="op">;</span> step) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb78-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// ... loop body ...</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb78-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s learn the meaning of these parts by example. The loop below runs <code>alert(i)</code> for <code>i</code> from <code>0</code> up to (but not including) <code>3</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {   // shows 0, then 1, then 2   alert(i); }</code></p>
<p>Let’s examine the <code>for</code> statement part-by-part:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 11%" />
<col style="width: 12%" />
<col style="width: 76%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>part</th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>begin</td>
<td><code>i = 0</code></td>
<td>Executes once upon entering the loop.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>condition</td>
<td><code>i &lt; 3</code></td>
<td>Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>body</td>
<td><code>alert(i)</code></td>
<td>Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>step</td>
<td><code>i++</code></td>
<td>Executes after the body on each iteration.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The general loop algorithm works like this:</p>
<pre><code>Run begin
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ ...</code></pre>
<p>That is, <code>begin</code> executes once, and then it iterates: after each <code>condition</code> test, <code>body</code> and <code>step</code> are executed.</p>
<p>If you are new to loops, it could help to go back to the example and reproduce how it runs step-by-step on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Here’s exactly what happens in our case:</p>

<p>for (; i &lt; 3; ) { alert(i++); } ```</p>
<p>This makes the loop identical to <code>while (i &lt; 3)</code>.</p>
<p>We can actually remove everything, creating an infinite loop:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb82"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb82-1" title="1"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="op">;;</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>Please note that the two <code>for</code> semicolons <code>;</code> must be present. Otherwise, there would be a syntax error.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-the-loop">Breaking the loop</h2>
<p>Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.</p>
<p>But we can force the exit at any time using the special <code>break</code> directive.</p>
<p>For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered:</p>
<p>```js run let sum = 0;</p>
<p>while (true) {</p>
<p>let value = +prompt(“Enter a number”, ’’);</p>
<p><em>!</em> if (!value) break; // (<em>) </em>/!*</p>
<p>sum += value;</p>
<p>} alert( ‘Sum:’ + sum ); ```</p>
<p>The <code>break</code> directive is activated at the line <code>(*)</code> if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, <code>alert</code>.</p>
<p>The combination “infinite loop + <code>break</code> as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.</p>
<h2 id="continue-to-the-next-iteration-continue">Continue to the next iteration [#continue]</h2>
<p>The <code>continue</code> directive is a “lighter version” of <code>break</code>. It doesn’t stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).</p>
<p>We can use it if we’re done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.</p>
<p>The loop below uses <code>continue</code> to output only odd values:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {</p>
<p>// if true, skip the remaining part of the body <em>!</em>if (i % 2 == 0) continue;<em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9 } ```</p>
<p>For even values of <code>i</code>, the <code>continue</code> directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of <code>for</code> (with the next number). So the <code>alert</code> is only called for odd values.</p>
<p>```<code>smart header="The</code>continue` directive helps decrease nesting" A loop that shows odd values could look like this:</p>
<p><code>js run for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {   if (i % 2) {     alert(i);   } }</code></p>
<p>From a technical point of view, this is identical to the example above. Surely, we can just wrap the code in an <code>if</code> block instead of using <code>continue</code>.</p>
<p>But as a side-effect, this created one more level of nesting (the <code>alert</code> call inside the curly braces). If the code inside of <code>if</code> is longer than a few lines, that may decrease the overall readability.</p>
<pre><code>
````warn header=&quot;No `break/continue` to the right side of &#39;?&#39;&quot;
Please note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the ternary operator `?`. In particular, directives such as `break/continue` aren&#39;t allowed there.

For example, if we take this code:

```js
if (i &gt; 5) {
  alert(i);
} else {
  continue;
}
```

...and rewrite it using a question mark:


```js no-beautify
(i &gt; 5) ? alert(i) : *!*continue*/!*; // continue isn&#39;t allowed here
```

...it stops working: there&#39;s a syntax error.

This is just another reason not to use the question mark operator `?` instead of `if`.</code></pre>
<h2 id="labels-for-breakcontinue">Labels for break/continue</h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below we loop over <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, prompting for the coordinates <code>(i, j)</code> from <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(2,2)</code>:</p>
<p>``<code>js run no-beautify for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {   for (let j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {     let input = prompt(</code>Value at coords (<span class="math inline"><em>i</em>,</span>{j})`, "");</p>
<pre><code>// what if we want to exit from here to Done (below)?</code></pre>
<p>} }</p>
<p>alert(“Done!”); ```</p>
<p>We need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.</p>
<p>The ordinary <code>break</code> after <code>input</code> would only break the inner loop. That’s not sufficient – labels, come to the rescue!</p>

<p>The <code>break &lt;labelName&gt;</code> statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify <em>!</em>outer:<em>/!</em> for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {</p>
<p>for (let j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {</p>
<pre><code>let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, &#39;&#39;);

// if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
if (!input) *!*break outer*/!*; // (*)

// do something with the value...</code></pre>
<p>} } alert(‘Done!’); ```</p>
<p>In the code above, <code>break outer</code> looks upwards for the label named <code>outer</code> and breaks out of that loop.</p>
<p>So the control goes straight from <code>(*)</code> to <code>alert('Done!')</code>.</p>
<p>We can also move the label onto a separate line:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify outer: for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) { ... }</code></p>
<p>The <code>continue</code> directive can also be used with a label. In this case, code execution jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.</p>
<p>````warn header=“Labels do not allow to”jump" anywhere" Labels do not allow us to jump into an arbitrary place in the code.</p>
<p>For example, it is impossible to do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb87"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb87-1" title="1"><span class="cf">break</span> label<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// jump to the label below (doesn&#39;t work)</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb87-3" title="3">label<span class="op">:</span> <span class="cf">for</span> (...)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>break</code> directive must be inside a code block. Technically, any labelled code block will do, e.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb88"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb88-1" title="1">label<span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>…Although, 99.9% of the time <code>break</code> used is inside loops, as we’ve seen in the examples above.</p>
<p>A <code>continue</code> is only possible from inside a loop. ````</p>
<h2 id="summary-13">Summary</h2>
<p>We covered 3 types of loops:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>while</code> – The condition is checked before each iteration.</li>
<li><code>do..while</code> – The condition is checked after each iteration.</li>
<li><code>for (;;)</code> – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make an “infinite” loop, usually the <code>while(true)</code> construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the <code>break</code> directive.</p>
<p>If we don’t want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the <code>continue</code> directive.</p>
<p><code>break/continue</code> support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for <code>break/continue</code> to escape a nested loop to go to an outer one.</p>
<h1 id="lookahead-and-lookbehind">Lookahead and lookbehind</h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to find only those matches for a pattern that are followed or preceded by another pattern.</p>
<p>There’s a special syntax for that, called “lookahead” and “lookbehind”, together referred to as “lookaround”.</p>
<p>For the start, let’s find the price from the string like <code>subject:1 turkey costs 30€</code>. That is: a number, followed by <code>subject:€</code> sign.</p>
<h2 id="lookahead">Lookahead</h2>
<p>The syntax is: <code>pattern:X(?=Y)</code>, it means “look for <code>pattern:X</code>, but match only if followed by <code>pattern:Y</code>”. There may be any pattern instead of <code>pattern:X</code> and <code>pattern:Y</code>.</p>
<p>For an integer number followed by <code>subject:€</code>, the regexp will be <code>pattern:\d+(?=€)</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “1 turkey costs 30€”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/(?=€)/)); // 30, the number 1 is ignored, as it’s not followed by € ```</p>
<p>Please note: the lookahead is merely a test, the contents of the parentheses <code>pattern:(?=...)</code> is not included in the result <code>match:30</code>.</p>
<p>When we look for <code>pattern:X(?=Y)</code>, the regular expression engine finds <code>pattern:X</code> and then checks if there’s <code>pattern:Y</code> immediately after it. If it’s not so, then the potential match is skipped, and the search continues.</p>
<p>More complex tests are possible, e.g. <code>pattern:X(?=Y)(?=Z)</code> means:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find <code>pattern:X</code>.</li>
<li>Check if <code>pattern:Y</code> is immediately after <code>pattern:X</code> (skip if isn’t).</li>
<li>Check if <code>pattern:Z</code> is also immediately after <code>pattern:X</code> (skip if isn’t).</li>
<li>If both tests passed, then the <code>pattern:X</code> is a match, otherwise continue searching.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, such pattern means that we’re looking for <code>pattern:X</code> followed by <code>pattern:Y</code> and <code>pattern:Z</code> at the same time.</p>
<p>That’s only possible if patterns <code>pattern:Y</code> and <code>pattern:Z</code> aren’t mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>For example, <code>pattern:\d+(?=\s)(?=.*30)</code> looks for <code>pattern:\d+</code> that is followed by a space <code>pattern:(?=\s)</code>, and there’s <code>30</code> somewhere after it <code>pattern:(?=.*30)</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “1 turkey costs 30€”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/(?=)(?=.*30)/)); // 1 ```</p>
<p>In our string that exactly matches the number <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="negative-lookahead">Negative lookahead</h2>
<p>Let’s say that we want a quantity instead, not a price from the same string. That’s a number <code>pattern:\d+</code>, NOT followed by <code>subject:€</code>.</p>
<p>For that, a negative lookahead can be applied.</p>
<p>The syntax is: <code>pattern:X(?!Y)</code>, it means “search <code>pattern:X</code>, but only if not followed by <code>pattern:Y</code>”.</p>
<p>```js run let str = “2 turkeys cost 60€”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/?!€)/g)); // 2 (the price is not matched) ```</p>
<h2 id="lookbehind">Lookbehind</h2>
<p>Lookahead allows to add a condition for “what follows”.</p>
<p>Lookbehind is similar, but it looks behind. That is, it allows to match a pattern only if there’s something before it.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive lookbehind: <code>pattern:(?&lt;=Y)X</code>, matches <code>pattern:X</code>, but only if there’s <code>pattern:Y</code> before it.</li>
<li>Negative lookbehind: <code>pattern:(?&lt;!Y)X</code>, matches <code>pattern:X</code>, but only if there’s no <code>pattern:Y</code> before it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s change the price to US dollars. The dollar sign is usually before the number, so to look for <code>$30</code> we’ll use <code>pattern:(?&lt;=\$)\d+</code> – an amount preceded by <code>subject:$</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “1 turkey costs $30”;</p>
<p>// the dollar sign is escaped $ alert(str.match(/(?&lt;=$)/)); // 30 (skipped the sole number) ```</p>
<p>And, if we need the quantity – a number, not preceded by <code>subject:$</code>, then we can use a negative lookbehind <code>pattern:(?&lt;!\$)\d+</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “2 turkeys cost $60”;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(/(?&lt;!$)/g)); // 2 (the price is not matched) ```</p>
<h2 id="capturing-groups">Capturing groups</h2>
<p>Generally, the contents inside lookaround parentheses does not become a part of the result.</p>
<p>E.g. in the pattern <code>pattern:\d+(?=€)</code>, the <code>pattern:€</code> sign doesn’t get captured as a part of the match. That’s natural: we look for a number <code>pattern:\d+</code>, while <code>pattern:(?=€)</code> is just a test that it should be followed by <code>subject:€</code>.</p>
<p>But in some situations we might want to capture the lookaround expression as well, or a part of it. That’s possible. Just wrap that part into additional parentheses.</p>
<p>In the example below the currency sign <code>pattern:(€|kr)</code> is captured, along with the amount:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “1 turkey costs 30€”; let regexp = /(?=(€|kr))/; // extra parentheses around €|kr</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // 30, € ```</p>
<p>And here’s the same for lookbehind:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “1 turkey costs $30”; let regexp = /(?&lt;=($|£))/;</p>
<p>alert(str.match(regexp)); // 30, $ ```</p>
<h2 id="summary-14">Summary</h2>
<p>Lookahead and lookbehind (commonly referred to as “lookaround”) are useful when we’d like to match something depending on the context before/after it.</p>
<p>For simple regexps we can do the similar thing manually. That is: match everything, in any context, and then filter by context in the loop.</p>
<p>Remember, <code>str.match</code> (without flag <code>pattern:g</code>) and <code>str.matchAll</code> (always) return matches as arrays with <code>index</code> property, so we know where exactly in the text it is, and can check the context.</p>
<p>But generally lookaround is more convenient.</p>

<h1 id="catastrophic-backtracking">Catastrophic backtracking</h1>
<p>Some regular expressions are looking simple, but can execute a veeeeeery long time, and even “hang” the JavaScript engine.</p>
<p>Sooner or later most developers occasionally face such behavior. The typical symptom – a regular expression works fine sometimes, but for certain strings it “hangs”, consuming 100% of CPU.</p>
<p>In such case a web-browser suggests to kill the script and reload the page. Not a good thing for sure.</p>
<p>For server-side JavaScript such a regexp may hang the server process, that’s even worse. So we definitely should take a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let’s say we have a string, and we’d like to check if it consists of words <code>pattern:\w+</code> with an optional space <code>pattern:\s?</code> after each.</p>
<p>An obvious way to construct a regexp would be to take a word followed by an optional space <code>pattern:\w+\s?</code> and then repeat it with <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>That leads us to the regexp <code>pattern:^(\w+\s?)*$</code>, it specifies zero or more such words, that start at the beginning <code>pattern:^</code> and finish at the end <code>pattern:$</code> of the line.</p>
<p>In action:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /^(+?)*$/;</p>
<p>alert(regexp.test(“A good string”)); // true alert(regexp.test(“Bad characters: $@#”)); // false ```</p>
<p>The regexp seems to work. The result is correct. Although, on certain strings it takes a lot of time. So long that JavaScript engine “hangs” with 100% CPU consumption.</p>
<p>If you run the example below, you probably won’t see anything, as JavaScript will just “hang”. A web-browser will stop reacting on events, the UI will stop working (most browsers allow only scrolling). After some time it will suggest to reload the page. So be careful with this:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /^(+?)*$/; let str = “An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regexp hang!”;</p>
<p>// will take a very long time alert(regexp.test(str)); ```</p>
<p>To be fair, let’s note that some regular expression engines can handle such a search effectively, for example V8 engine version starting from 8.8 can do that (so Google Chrome 88 doesn’t hang here), while Firefox browser does hang.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-example">Simplified example</h2>
<p>What’s the matter? Why does the regular expression hang?</p>
<p>To understand that, let’s simplify the example: remove spaces <code>pattern:\s?</code>. Then it becomes <code>pattern:^(\w+)*$</code>.</p>
<p>And, to make things more obvious, let’s replace <code>pattern:\w</code> with <code>pattern:\d</code>. The resulting regular expression still hangs, for instance:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /^()*$/;</p>
<p>let str = “012345678901234567890123456789z”;</p>
<p>// will take a very long time (careful!) alert(regexp.test(str));</p>
<pre><code>
So what&#39;s wrong with the regexp?

First, one may notice that the regexp `pattern:(\d+)*` is a little bit strange. The quantifier `pattern:*` looks extraneous. If we want a number, we can use `pattern:\d+`.

Indeed, the regexp is artificial; we got it by simplifying the previous example. But the reason why it is slow is the same. So let&#39;s understand it, and then the previous example will become obvious.

What happens during the search of `pattern:^(\d+)*$` in the line `subject:123456789z` (shortened a bit for clarity, please note a non-digit character `subject:z` at the end, it&#39;s important), why does it take so long?

Here&#39;s what the regexp engine does:

1. First, the regexp engine tries to find the content of the parentheses: the number `pattern:\d+`. The plus `pattern:+` is greedy by default, so it consumes all digits:
</code></pre>
<p>……. (123456789)z ```</p>
<p>After all digits are consumed, <code>pattern:\d+</code> is considered found (as <code>match:123456789</code>).</p>
<p>Then the star quantifier <code>pattern:(\d+)*</code> applies. But there are no more digits in the text, so the star doesn’t give anything.</p>
<p>The next character in the pattern is the string end <code>pattern:$</code>. But in the text we have <code>subject:z</code> instead, so there’s no match:</p>
<pre><code>           X
\d+........$
(123456789)z</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>As there’s no match, the greedy quantifier <code>pattern:+</code> decreases the count of repetitions, backtracks one character back.</p>
<p>Now <code>pattern:\d+</code> takes all digits except the last one (<code>match:12345678</code>):</p>
<pre><code>\d+.......
(12345678)9z</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then the engine tries to continue the search from the next position (right after <code>match:12345678</code>).</p>
<p>The star <code>pattern:(\d+)*</code> can be applied – it gives one more match of <code>pattern:\d+</code>, the number <code>match:9</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
\d+.......\d+
(12345678)(9)z</code></pre>
<p>The engine tries to match <code>pattern:$</code> again, but fails, because it meets <code>subject:z</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>             X
\d+.......\d+
(12345678)(9)z</code></pre></li>
<li><p>There’s no match, so the engine will continue backtracking, decreasing the number of repetitions. Backtracking generally works like this: the last greedy quantifier decreases the number of repetitions until it reaches the minimum. Then the previous greedy quantifier decreases, and so on.</p>
<p>All possible combinations are attempted. Here are their examples.</p>
<p>The first number <code>pattern:\d+</code> has 7 digits, and then a number of 2 digits:</p>
<pre><code>             X
\d+......\d+
(1234567)(89)z</code></pre>
<p>The first number has 7 digits, and then two numbers of 1 digit each:</p>
<pre><code>               X
\d+......\d+\d+
(1234567)(8)(9)z</code></pre>
<p>The first number has 6 digits, and then a number of 3 digits:</p>
<pre><code>             X
\d+.......\d+
(123456)(789)z</code></pre>
<p>The first number has 6 digits, and then 2 numbers:</p>
<pre><code>               X
\d+.....\d+ \d+
(123456)(78)(9)z</code></pre>
<p>…And so on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many ways to split a sequence of digits <code>123456789</code> into numbers. To be precise, there are <code>2<sup>n</sup>-1</code>, where <code>n</code> is the length of the sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>123456789</code> we have <code>n=9</code>, that gives 511 combinations.</li>
<li>For a longer sequence with <code>n=20</code> there are about one million (1048575) combinations.</li>
<li>For <code>n=30</code> - a thousand times more (1073741823 combinations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying each of them is exactly the reason why the search takes so long.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-words-and-strings">Back to words and strings</h2>
<p>The similar thing happens in our first example, when we look for words by pattern <code>pattern:^(\w+\s?)*$</code> in the string <code>subject:An input that hangs!</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that a word can be represented as one <code>pattern:\w+</code> or many:</p>
<pre><code>(input)
(inpu)(t)
(inp)(u)(t)
(in)(p)(ut)
...</code></pre>
<p>For a human, it’s obvious that there may be no match, because the string ends with an exclamation sign <code>!</code>, but the regular expression expects a wordly character <code>pattern:\w</code> or a space <code>pattern:\s</code> at the end. But the engine doesn’t know that.</p>
<p>It tries all combinations of how the regexp <code>pattern:(\w+\s?)*</code> can “consume” the string, including variants with spaces <code>pattern:(\w+\s)*</code> and without them <code>pattern:(\w+)*</code> (because spaces <code>pattern:\s?</code> are optional). As there are many such combinations (we’ve seen it with digits), the search takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Should we turn on the lazy mode?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that won’t help: if we replace <code>pattern:\w+</code> with <code>pattern:\w+?</code>, the regexp will still hang. The order of combinations will change, but not their total count.</p>
<p>Some regular expression engines have tricky tests and finite automations that allow to avoid going through all combinations or make it much faster, but most engines don’t, and it doesn’t always help.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-fix">How to fix?</h2>
<p>There are two main approaches to fixing the problem.</p>
<p>The first is to lower the number of possible combinations.</p>
<p>Let’s make the space non-optional by rewriting the regular expression as <code>pattern:^(\w+\s)*\w*$</code> - we’ll look for any number of words followed by a space <code>pattern:(\w+\s)*</code>, and then (optionally) a final word <code>pattern:\w*</code>.</p>
<p>This regexp is equivalent to the previous one (matches the same) and works well:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /^(+)*$/; let str = “An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regex hang!”;</p>
<p>alert(regexp.test(str)); // false</p>
<pre><code>
Why did the problem disappear?

That&#39;s because now the space is mandatory.

The previous regexp, if we omit the space, becomes `pattern:(\w+)*`, leading to many combinations of `\w+` within a single word

So `subject:input` could be matched as two repetitions of `pattern:\w+`, like this:
</code></pre>
<p>+ + (inp)(ut)</p>
<pre><code>
The new pattern is different: `pattern:(\w+\s)*` specifies repetitions of words followed by a space! The `subject:input` string can&#39;t be matched as two repetitions of `pattern:\w+\s`, because the space is mandatory.

The time needed to try a lot of (actually most of) combinations is now saved.

## Preventing backtracking

It&#39;s not always convenient to rewrite a regexp though. In the example above it was easy, but it&#39;s not always obvious how to do it.

Besides, a rewritten regexp is usually more complex, and that&#39;s not good. Regexps are complex enough without extra efforts.

Luckily, there&#39;s an alternative approach. We can forbid backtracking for the quantifier.

The root of the problem is that the regexp engine tries many combinations that are obviously wrong for a human.

E.g. in the regexp `pattern:(\d+)*$` it&#39;s obvious for a human, that `pattern:+` shouldn&#39;t backtrack. If we replace one `pattern:\d+` with two separate `pattern:\d+\d+`, nothing changes:
</code></pre>
<p>…….. (123456789)!</p>
<p>……. (1234)(56789)! ```</p>
<p>And in the original example <code>pattern:^(\w+\s?)*$</code> we may want to forbid backtracking in <code>pattern:\w+</code>. That is: <code>pattern:\w+</code> should match a whole word, with the maximal possible length. There’s no need to lower the repetitions count in <code>pattern:\w+</code> or to split it into two words <code>pattern:\w+\w+</code> and so on.</p>
<p>Modern regular expression engines support possessive quantifiers for that. Regular quantifiers become possessive if we add <code>pattern:+</code> after them. That is, we use <code>pattern:\d++</code> instead of <code>pattern:\d+</code> to stop <code>pattern:+</code> from backtracking.</p>
<p>Possessive quantifiers are in fact simpler than “regular” ones. They just match as many as they can, without any backtracking. The search process without bracktracking is simpler.</p>
<p>There are also so-called “atomic capturing groups” - a way to disable backtracking inside parentheses.</p>
<p>…But the bad news is that, unfortunately, in JavaScript they are not supported.</p>
<p>We can emulate them though using a “lookahead transform”.</p>
<h3 id="lookahead-to-the-rescue">Lookahead to the rescue!</h3>
<p>So we’ve come to real advanced topics. We’d like a quantifier, such as <code>pattern:+</code> not to backtrack, because sometimes backtracking makes no sense.</p>
<p>The pattern to take as many repetitions of <code>pattern:\w</code> as possible without backtracking is: <code>pattern:(?=(\w+))\1</code>. Of course, we could take another pattern instead of <code>pattern:\w</code>.</p>
<p>That may seem odd, but it’s actually a very simple transform.</p>
<p>Let’s decipher it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lookahead <code>pattern:?=</code> looks forward for the longest word <code>pattern:\w+</code> starting at the current position.</li>
<li>The contents of parentheses with <code>pattern:?=...</code> isn’t memorized by the engine, so wrap <code>pattern:\w+</code> into parentheses. Then the engine will memorize their contents</li>
<li>…And allow us to reference it in the pattern as <code>pattern:\1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is: we look ahead - and if there’s a word <code>pattern:\w+</code>, then match it as <code>pattern:\1</code>.</p>
<p>Why? That’s because the lookahead finds a word <code>pattern:\w+</code> as a whole and we capture it into the pattern with <code>pattern:\1</code>. So we essentially implemented a possessive plus <code>pattern:+</code> quantifier. It captures only the whole word <code>pattern:\w+</code>, not a part of it.</p>
<p>For instance, in the word <code>subject:JavaScript</code> it may not only match <code>match:Java</code>, but leave out <code>match:Script</code> to match the rest of the pattern.</p>
<p>Here’s the comparison of two patterns:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("JavaScript".match(/\w+Script/)); // JavaScript alert("JavaScript".match(/(?=(\w+))\1Script/)); // null</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the first variant <code>pattern:\w+</code> first captures the whole word <code>subject:JavaScript</code> but then <code>pattern:+</code> backtracks character by character, to try to match the rest of the pattern, until it finally succeeds (when <code>pattern:\w+</code> matches <code>match:Java</code>).</li>
<li>In the second variant <code>pattern:(?=(\w+))</code> looks ahead and finds the word <code>subject:JavaScript</code>, that is included into the pattern as a whole by <code>pattern:\1</code>, so there remains no way to find <code>subject:Script</code> after it.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can put a more complex regular expression into <code>pattern:(?=(\w+))\1</code> instead of <code>pattern:\w</code>, when we need to forbid backtracking for <code>pattern:+</code> after it.</p>
<pre class="smart"><code>There&#39;s more about the relation between possessive quantifiers and lookahead in articles [Regex: Emulate Atomic Grouping (and Possessive Quantifiers) with LookAhead](http://instanceof.me/post/52245507631/regex-emulate-atomic-grouping-with-lookahead) and [Mimicking Atomic Groups](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/mimic-atomic-groups).</code></pre>

<p>let str = “An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regex hang!”;</p>
<p>alert(regexp.test(str)); // false, works and fast! ```</p>
<p>Here <code>pattern:\2</code> is used instead of <code>pattern:\1</code>, because there are additional outer parentheses. To avoid messing up with the numbers, we can give the parentheses a name, e.g. <code>pattern:(?&lt;word&gt;\w+)</code>.</p>
<p>```js run // parentheses are named ?<word>, referenced as word&gt; let regexp = /^((?=(?<word>+))word&gt;?)*$/;</p>

<h1 id="sticky-flag-y-searching-at-position">Sticky flag “y”, searching at position</h1>
<p>The flag <code>pattern:y</code> allows to perform the search at the given position in the source string.</p>
<p>To grasp the use case of <code>pattern:y</code> flag, and better understand the ways of regexps, let’s explore a practical example.</p>
<p>One of common tasks for regexps is “lexical analysis”: we get a text, e.g. in a programming language, and need to find its structural elements. For instance, HTML has tags and attributes, JavaScript code has functions, variables, and so on.</p>
<p>Writing lexical analyzers is a special area, with its own tools and algorithms, so we don’t go deep in there, but there’s a common task: to read something at the given position.</p>
<p>E.g. we have a code string <code>subject:let varName = "value"</code>, and we need to read the variable name from it, that starts at position <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>We’ll look for variable name using regexp <code>pattern:\w+</code>. Actually, JavaScript variable names need a bit more complex regexp for accurate matching, but here it doesn’t matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>A call to <code>str.match(/\w+/)</code> will find only the first word in the line (<code>let</code>). That’s not it.</li>
<li>We can add the flag <code>pattern:g</code>. But then the call <code>str.match(/\w+/g)</code> will look for all words in the text, while we need one word at position <code>4</code>. Again, not what we need.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, how to search for a regexp exactly at the given position?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s try using method <code>regexp.exec(str)</code>.</p>
<p>For a <code>regexp</code> without flags <code>pattern:g</code> and <code>pattern:y</code>, this method looks only for the first match, it works exactly like <code>str.match(regexp)</code>.</p>
<p>…But if there’s flag <code>pattern:g</code>, then it performs the search in <code>str</code>, starting from position stored in the <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> property. And, if it finds a match, then sets <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> to the index immediately after the match.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> serves as a starting point for the search, that each <code>regexp.exec(str)</code> call resets to the new value (“after the last match”). That’s only if there’s <code>pattern:g</code> flag, of course.</p>
<p>So, successive calls to <code>regexp.exec(str)</code> return matches one after another.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of such calls:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “let varName”; // Let’s find all words in this string let regexp = /+/g;</p>
<p>alert(regexp.lastIndex); // 0 (initially lastIndex=0)</p>
<p>let word1 = regexp.exec(str); alert(word1[0]); // let (1st word) alert(regexp.lastIndex); // 3 (position after the match)</p>
<p>let word2 = regexp.exec(str); alert(word2[0]); // varName (2nd word) alert(regexp.lastIndex); // 11 (position after the match)</p>
<p>let word3 = regexp.exec(str); alert(word3); // null (no more matches) alert(regexp.lastIndex); // 0 (resets at search end) ```</p>
<p>We can get all matches in the loop:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “let varName”; let regexp = /+/g;</p>
<p>let result;</p>
<p>while ((result = regexp.exec(str))) { alert(<code>Found ${result[0]} at position ${result.index}</code>); // Found let at position 0, then // Found varName at position 4 } ```</p>
<p>Such use of <code>regexp.exec</code> is an alternative to method <code>str.matchAll</code>, with a bit more control over the process.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our task.</p>
<p>We can manually set <code>lastIndex</code> to <code>4</code>, to start the search from the given position!</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘let varName = “value”’;</p>
<p>let regexp = /+/g; // without flag “g”, property lastIndex is ignored</p>
<p><em>!</em> regexp.lastIndex = 4; <em>/!</em></p>
<p>let word = regexp.exec(str); alert(word); // varName ```</p>
<p>Hooray! Problem solved!</p>
<p>We performed a search of <code>pattern:\w+</code>, starting from position <code>regexp.lastIndex = 4</code>.</p>
<p>The result is correct.</p>
<p>…But wait, not so fast.</p>
<p>Please note: the <code>regexp.exec</code> call starts searching at position <code>lastIndex</code> and then goes further. If there’s no word at position <code>lastIndex</code>, but it’s somewhere after it, then it will be found:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘let varName = “value”’;</p>
<p>let regexp = /+/g;</p>
<p><em>!</em> // start the search from position 3 regexp.lastIndex = 3; <em>/!</em></p>
<p>let word = regexp.exec(str); // found the match at position 4 alert(word[0]); // varName alert(word.index); // 4 ```</p>
<p>For some tasks, including the lexical analysis, that’s just wrong. We need to find a match exactly at the given position at the text, not somewhere after it. And that’s what the flag <code>y</code> is for.</p>
<p><strong>The flag <code>pattern:y</code> makes <code>regexp.exec</code> to search exactly at position <code>lastIndex</code>, not “starting from” it.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the same search with flag <code>pattern:y</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘let varName = “value”’;</p>
<p>let regexp = /+/y;</p>
<p>regexp.lastIndex = 3; alert(regexp.exec(str)); // null (there’s a space at position 3, not a word)</p>
<p>regexp.lastIndex = 4; alert(regexp.exec(str)); // varName (word at position 4) ```</p>
<p>As we can see, regexp <code>pattern:/\w+/y</code> doesn’t match at position <code>3</code> (unlike the flag <code>pattern:g</code>), but matches at position <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Not only that’s what we need, there’s an important performance gain when using flag <code>pattern:y</code>.</p>
<p>Imagine, we have a long text, and there are no matches in it, at all. Then a search with flag <code>pattern:g</code> will go till the end of the text and find nothing, and this will take significantly more time than the search with flag <code>pattern:y</code>, that checks only the exact position.</p>
<p>In tasks like lexical analysis, there are usually many searches at an exact position, to check what we have there. Using flag <code>pattern:y</code> is the key for correct implementations and a good performance.</p>
<h1 id="methods-of-regexp-and-string">Methods of RegExp and String</h1>
<p>In this article we’ll cover various methods that work with regexps in-depth.</p>
<h2 id="str.matchregexp">str.match(regexp)</h2>
<p>The method <code>str.match(regexp)</code> finds matches for <code>regexp</code> in the string <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>It has 3 modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If the <code>regexp</code> doesn’t have flag <code>pattern:g</code>, then it returns the first match as an array with capturing groups and properties <code>index</code> (position of the match), <code>input</code> (input string, equals <code>str</code>):</p>
<p>```js run let str = “I love JavaScript”;</p>
<p>let result = str.match(/Java(Script)/);</p>
<p>alert(result[0]); // JavaScript (full match) alert(result[1]); // Script (first capturing group) alert(result.length); // 2</p>
<p>// Additional information: alert(result.index); // 7 (match position) alert(result.input); // I love JavaScript (source string) ```</p></li>
<li><p>If the <code>regexp</code> has flag <code>pattern:g</code>, then it returns an array of all matches as strings, without capturing groups and other details.</p>
<p>```js run let str = “I love JavaScript”;</p>
<p>let result = str.match(/Java(Script)/g);</p>
<p>alert(result[0]); // JavaScript alert(result.length); // 1 ```</p></li>
<li><p>If there are no matches, no matter if there’s flag <code>pattern:g</code> or not, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
<p>That’s an important nuance. If there are no matches, we don’t get an empty array, but <code>null</code>. It’s easy to make a mistake forgetting about it, e.g.:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “I love JavaScript”;</p>
<p>let result = str.match(/HTML/);</p>
<p>alert(result); // null alert(result.length); // Error: Cannot read property ‘length’ of null ```</p>
<p>If we want the result to be an array, we can write like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> result <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">str</span>.<span class="at">match</span>(regexp) <span class="op">||</span> []<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="str.matchallregexp">str.matchAll(regexp)</h2>
<p>[recent browser=“new”]</p>
<p>The method <code>str.matchAll(regexp)</code> is a “newer, improved” variant of <code>str.match</code>.</p>
<p>It’s used mainly to search for all matches with all groups.</p>
<p>There are 3 differences from <code>match</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It returns an iterable object with matches instead of an array. We can make a regular array from it using <code>Array.from</code>.</li>
<li>Every match is returned as an array with capturing groups (the same format as <code>str.match</code> without flag <code>pattern:g</code>).</li>
<li>If there are no results, it returns not <code>null</code>, but an empty iterable object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usage example:</p>
```js run let str = "
<h1>
Hello, world!
</h1>
<p>"; let regexp = /&lt;(.*?)&gt;/g;</p>
<p>let matchAll = str.matchAll(regexp);</p>
<p>alert(matchAll); // [object RegExp String Iterator], not array, but an iterable</p>
<p>matchAll = Array.from(matchAll); // array now</p>
let firstMatch = matchAll[0]; alert(firstMatch[0]); //
<h1>
alert(firstMatch[1]); // h1 alert(firstMatch.index); // 0 alert(firstMatch.input); //
<h1>
Hello, world!
</h1>
<p>```</p>
<p>If we use <code>for..of</code> to loop over <code>matchAll</code> matches, then we don’t need <code>Array.from</code> any more.</p>
<h2 id="str.splitregexpsubstr-limit">str.split(regexp|substr, limit)</h2>
<p>Splits the string using the regexp (or a substring) as a delimiter.</p>
<p>We can use <code>split</code> with strings, like this:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("12-34-56".split("-")); // array of ['12', '34', '56']</code></p>
<p>But we can split by a regular expression, the same way:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("12, 34, 56".split(/,\s*/)); // array of ['12', '34', '56']</code></p>
<h2 id="str.searchregexp">str.search(regexp)</h2>
<p>The method <code>str.search(regexp)</code> returns the position of the first match or <code>-1</code> if none found:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “A drop of ink may make a million think”;</p>
<p>alert(str.search(/ink/i)); // 10 (first match position) ```</p>
<p><strong>The important limitation: <code>search</code> only finds the first match.</strong></p>
<p>If we need positions of further matches, we should use other means, such as finding them all with <code>str.matchAll(regexp)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="str.replacestrregexp-strfunc">str.replace(str|regexp, str|func)</h2>
<p>This is a generic method for searching and replacing, one of most useful ones. The swiss army knife for searching and replacing.</p>
<p>We can use it without regexps, to search and replace a substring:</p>
<p><code>js run // replace a dash by a colon alert("12-34-56".replace("-", ":")); // 12:34-56</code></p>
<p>There’s a pitfall though.</p>
<p><strong>When the first argument of <code>replace</code> is a string, it only replaces the first match.</strong></p>
<p>You can see that in the example above: only the first <code>"-"</code> is replaced by <code>":"</code>.</p>
<p>To find all hyphens, we need to use not the string <code>"-"</code>, but a regexp <code>pattern:/-/g</code>, with the obligatory <code>pattern:g</code> flag:</p>
<p><code>js run // replace all dashes by a colon alert( '12-34-56'.replace( *!*/-/g*/!*, ":" ) )  // 12:34:56</code></p>
<p>The second argument is a replacement string. We can use special characters in it:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 14%" />
<col style="width: 85%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “John Smith”;</p>
<p>// swap first and last name alert(str.replace(/(john) (smith)/i, “$2, $1”)); // Smith, John ```</p>
<p><strong>For situations that require “smart” replacements, the second argument can be a function.</strong></p>
<p>It will be called for each match, and the returned value will be inserted as a replacement.</p>
<p>The function is called with arguments <code>func(match, p1, p2, ..., pn, offset, input, groups)</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>match</code> – the match,</li>
<li><code>p1, p2, ..., pn</code> – contents of capturing groups (if there are any),</li>
<li><code>offset</code> – position of the match,</li>
<li><code>input</code> – the source string,</li>
<li><code>groups</code> – an object with named groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are no parentheses in the regexp, then there are only 3 arguments: <code>func(str, offset, input)</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let’s uppercase all matches:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “html and css”;</p>
<p>let result = str.replace(/html|css/gi, (str) =&gt; str.toUpperCase());</p>
<p>alert(result); // HTML and CSS ```</p>
<p>Replace each match by its position in the string:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("Ho-Ho-ho".replace(/ho/gi, (match, offset) =&gt; offset)); // 0-3-6</code></p>
<p>In the example below there are two parentheses, so the replacement function is called with 5 arguments: the first is the full match, then 2 parentheses, and after it (not used in the example) the match position and the source string:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “John Smith”;</p>
<p>let result = str.replace( /(+) (+)/, (match, name, surname) =&gt; <code>${surname}, ${name}</code> );</p>
<p>alert(result); // Smith, John ```</p>
<p>If there are many groups, it’s convenient to use rest parameters to access them:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “John Smith”;</p>
<p>let result = str.replace( /(+) (+)/, (…match) =&gt; <code>${match[2]}, ${match[1]}</code> );</p>
<p>alert(result); // Smith, John ```</p>
<p>Or, if we’re using named groups, then <code>groups</code> object with them is always the last, so we can obtain it like this:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “John Smith”;</p>
<p>let result = str.replace(/(?<name>+) (?<surname>+)/, (…match) =&gt; { let groups = match.pop();</p>
<p>return <code>${groups.surname}, ${groups.name}</code>; });</p>
<p>alert(result); // Smith, John ```</p>
<p>Using a function gives us the ultimate replacement power, because it gets all the information about the match, has access to outer variables and can do everything.</p>
<h2 id="str.replaceallstrregexp-strfunc">str.replaceAll(str|regexp, str|func)</h2>
<p>This method is essentially the same as <code>str.replace</code>, with two major differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the first argument is a string, it replaces <em>all occurences</em> of the string, while <code>replace</code> replaces only the <em>first occurence</em>.</li>
<li>If the first argument is a regular expression without the <code>g</code> flag, there’ll be an error. With <code>g</code> flag, it works the same as <code>replace</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main use case for <code>replaceAll</code> is replacing all occurences of a string.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p><code>js run // replace all dashes by a colon alert("12-34-56".replaceAll("-", ":")); // 12:34:56</code></p>
<h2 id="regexp.execstr">regexp.exec(str)</h2>
<p>The method <code>regexp.exec(str)</code> method returns a match for <code>regexp</code> in the string <code>str</code>. Unlike previous methods, it’s called on a regexp, not on a string.</p>
<p>It behaves differently depending on whether the regexp has flag <code>pattern:g</code>.</p>
<p>If there’s no <code>pattern:g</code>, then <code>regexp.exec(str)</code> returns the first match exactly as <code>str.match(regexp)</code>. This behavior doesn’t bring anything new.</p>
<p>But if there’s flag <code>pattern:g</code>, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>A call to <code>regexp.exec(str)</code> returns the first match and saves the position immediately after it in the property <code>regexp.lastIndex</code>.</li>
<li>The next such call starts the search from position <code>regexp.lastIndex</code>, returns the next match and saves the position after it in <code>regexp.lastIndex</code>.</li>
<li>…And so on.</li>
<li>If there are no matches, <code>regexp.exec</code> returns <code>null</code> and resets <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, repeated calls return all matches one after another, using property <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> to keep track of the current search position.</p>
<p>In the past, before the method <code>str.matchAll</code> was added to JavaScript, calls of <code>regexp.exec</code> were used in the loop to get all matches with groups:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “More about JavaScript at https://javascript.info”; let regexp = /javascript/gi;</p>
<p>let result;</p>
<p>while ((result = regexp.exec(str))) { alert(<code>Found ${result[0]} at position ${result.index}</code>); // Found JavaScript at position 11, then // Found javascript at position 33 } ```</p>
<p>This works now as well, although for newer browsers <code>str.matchAll</code> is usually more convenient.</p>
<p><strong>We can use <code>regexp.exec</code> to search from a given position by manually setting <code>lastIndex</code>.</strong></p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Hello, world!”;</p>
<p>let regexp = /+/g; // without flag “g”, lastIndex property is ignored regexp.lastIndex = 5; // search from 5th position (from the comma)</p>
<p>alert(regexp.exec(str)); // world ```</p>
<p>If the regexp has flag <code>pattern:y</code>, then the search will be performed exactly at the position <code>regexp.lastIndex</code>, not any further.</p>
<p>Let’s replace flag <code>pattern:g</code> with <code>pattern:y</code> in the example above. There will be no matches, as there’s no word at position <code>5</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Hello, world!”;</p>
<p>let regexp = /+/y; regexp.lastIndex = 5; // search exactly at position 5</p>
<p>alert(regexp.exec(str)); // null ```</p>
<p>That’s convenient for situations when we need to “read” something from the string by a regexp at the exact position, not somewhere further.</p>
<h2 id="regexp.teststr">regexp.test(str)</h2>
<p>The method <code>regexp.test(str)</code> looks for a match and returns <code>true/false</code> whether it exists.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “I love JavaScript”;</p>
<p>// these two tests do the same alert( <em>!</em>/love/i<em>/!</em>.test(str) ); // true alert( str.search(<em>!</em>/love/i<em>/!</em>) != -1 ); // true ```</p>
<p>An example with the negative answer:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Bla-bla-bla”;</p>
<p>alert( <em>!</em>/love/i<em>/!</em>.test(str) ); // false alert( str.search(<em>!</em>/love/i<em>/!</em>) != -1 ); // false ```</p>
<p>If the regexp has flag <code>pattern:g</code>, then <code>regexp.test</code> looks from <code>regexp.lastIndex</code> property and updates this property, just like <code>regexp.exec</code>.</p>
<p>So we can use it to search from a given position:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /love/gi;</p>
<p>let str = “I love JavaScript”;</p>
<p>// start the search from position 10: regexp.lastIndex = 10; alert(regexp.test(str)); // false (no match) ```</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Same global regexp tested repeatedly on different sources may fail" If we apply the same global regexp to different inputs, it may lead to wrong result, because</code>regexp.test<code>call advances</code>regexp.lastIndex` property, so the search in another string may start from non-zero position.</p>
<p>For instance, here we call <code>regexp.test</code> twice on the same text, and the second time fails:</p>
<p>```js run let regexp = /javascript/g; // (regexp just created: regexp.lastIndex=0)</p>
<p>alert( regexp.test(“javascript”) ); // true (regexp.lastIndex=10 now) alert( regexp.test(“javascript”) ); // false</p>
<pre><code>
That&#39;s exactly because `regexp.lastIndex` is non-zero in the second test.

To work around that, we can set `regexp.lastIndex = 0` before each search. Or instead of calling methods on regexp, use string methods `str.match/search/...`, they don&#39;t use `lastIndex`.</code></pre>
<h1 id="the-switch-statement">The “switch” statement</h1>
<p>A <code>switch</code> statement can replace multiple <code>if</code> checks.</p>
<p>It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.</p>
<h2 id="the-syntax">The syntax</h2>
<p>The <code>switch</code> has one or more <code>case</code> blocks and an optional default.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p>```js no-beautify switch(x) { case ‘value1’: // if (x === ‘value1’) … [break]</p>
<p>case ‘value2’: // if (x === ‘value2’) … [break]</p>
<p>default: … [break] } ```</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of <code>x</code> is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first <code>case</code> (that is, <code>value1</code>) then to the second (<code>value2</code>) and so on.</li>
<li>If the equality is found, <code>switch</code> starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding <code>case</code>, until the nearest <code>break</code> (or until the end of <code>switch</code>).</li>
<li>If no case is matched then the <code>default</code> code is executed (if it exists).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>An example of <code>switch</code> (the executed code is highlighted):</p>
<p>```js run let a = 2 + 2;</p>
<p>switch (a) { case 3: alert( ‘Too small’ ); break; <em>!</em> case 4: alert( ‘Exactly!’ ); break; <em>/!</em> case 5: alert( ‘Too big’ ); break; default: alert( “I don’t know such values” ); } ```</p>
<p>Here the <code>switch</code> starts to compare <code>a</code> from the first <code>case</code> variant that is <code>3</code>. The match fails.</p>
<p>Then <code>4</code>. That’s a match, so the execution starts from <code>case 4</code> until the nearest <code>break</code>.</p>
<p><strong>If there is no <code>break</code> then the execution continues with the next <code>case</code> without any checks.</strong></p>
<p>An example without <code>break</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let a = 2 + 2;</p>
<p>switch (a) { case 3: alert( ‘Too small’ ); <em>!</em> case 4: alert( ‘Exactly!’ ); case 5: alert( ‘Too big’ ); default: alert( “I don’t know such values” ); <em>/!</em> } ```</p>
<p>In the example above we’ll see sequential execution of three <code>alert</code>s:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb104"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-1" title="1"><span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Exactly!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-2" title="2"><span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Too big&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-3" title="3"><span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="st">&quot;I don&#39;t know such values&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>```<code>smart header="Any expression can be a</code>switch/case<code>argument" Both</code>switch<code>and</code>case` allow arbitrary expressions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>```js run let a = “1”; let b = 0;</p>
<p>switch (+a) { <em>!</em> case b + 1: alert(“this runs, because +a is 1, exactly equals b+1”); break; <em>/!</em></p>
<p>default: alert(“this doesn’t run”); }</p>
<pre><code>
Here `+a` gives `1`, that&#39;s compared with `b + 1` in `case`, and the corresponding code is executed.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="grouping-of-case">Grouping of “case”</h2>
<p>Several variants of <code>case</code> which share the same code can be grouped.</p>
<p>For example, if we want the same code to run for <code>case 3</code> and <code>case 5</code>:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify let a = 3;</p>
<p>switch (a) { case 4: alert(‘Right!’); break;</p>
<p><em>!</em> case 3: // (<em>) grouped two cases case 5: alert(‘Wrong!’); alert(“Why don’t you take a math class?”); break; </em>/!*</p>
<p>default: alert(‘The result is strange. Really.’); } ```</p>
<p>Now both <code>3</code> and <code>5</code> show the same message.</p>
<p>The ability to “group” cases is a side-effect of how <code>switch/case</code> works without <code>break</code>. Here the execution of <code>case 3</code> starts from the line <code>(*)</code> and goes through <code>case 5</code>, because there’s no <code>break</code>.</p>
<h2 id="type-matters">Type matters</h2>
<p>Let’s emphasize that the equality check is always strict. The values must be of the same type to match.</p>
<p>For example, let’s consider the code:</p>
<p>```js run let arg = prompt(“Enter a value?”); switch (arg) { case ‘0’: case ‘1’: alert( ‘One or zero’ ); break;</p>
<p>case ‘2’: alert( ‘Two’ ); break;</p>
<p>case 3: alert( ‘Never executes!’ ); break; default: alert( ‘An unknown value’ ); } ```</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, the first <code>alert</code> runs.</li>
<li>For <code>2</code> the second <code>alert</code> runs.</li>
<li>But for <code>3</code>, the result of the <code>prompt</code> is a string <code>"3"</code>, which is not strictly equal <code>===</code> to the number <code>3</code>. So we’ve got a dead code in <code>case 3</code>! The <code>default</code> variant will execute. # Functions</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.</p>
<p>For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.</p>
<p>Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen examples of built-in functions, like <code>alert(message)</code>, <code>prompt(message, default)</code> and <code>confirm(question)</code>. But we can create functions of our own as well.</p>
<h2 id="function-declaration">Function Declaration</h2>
<p>To create a function we can use a <em>function declaration</em>.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb106"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb106-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">showMessage</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb106-2" title="2">  <span class="at">alert</span>( <span class="st">&#39;Hello everyone!&#39;</span> )<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb106-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>function</code> keyword goes first, then goes the <em>name of the function</em>, then a list of <em>parameters</em> between the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function, also named “the function body”, between curly braces.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb107"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">name</span>(parameters) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-2" title="2">  ...<span class="va">body</span>...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Our new function can be called by its name: <code>showMessage()</code>.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage() { alert( ‘Hello everyone!’ ); }</p>
<p><em>!</em> showMessage(); showMessage(); <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>The call <code>showMessage()</code> executes the code of the function. Here we will see the message two times.</p>
<p>This example clearly demonstrates one of the main purposes of functions: to avoid code duplication.</p>
<p>If we ever need to change the message or the way it is shown, it’s enough to modify the code in one place: the function which outputs it.</p>
<h2 id="local-variables">Local variables</h2>
<p>A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage() { <em>!</em> let message = “Hello, I’m JavaScript!”; // local variable <em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert( message ); }</p>
<p>showMessage(); // Hello, I’m JavaScript!</p>
<p>alert( message ); // &lt;– Error! The variable is local to the function ```</p>
<h2 id="outer-variables">Outer variables</h2>
<p>A function can access an outer variable as well, for example:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify let <em>!</em>userName<em>/!</em> = ‘John’;</p>
<p>function showMessage() { let message = ‘Hello,’ + <em>!</em>userName<em>/!</em>; alert(message); }</p>
<p>showMessage(); // Hello, John ```</p>
<p>The function has full access to the outer variable. It can modify it as well.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let <em>!</em>userName<em>/!</em> = ‘John’;</p>
<p>function showMessage() { <em>!</em>userName<em>/!</em> = “Bob”; // (1) changed the outer variable</p>
<p>let message = ‘Hello,’ + <em>!</em>userName<em>/!</em>; alert(message); }</p>
<p>alert( userName ); // <em>!</em>John<em>/!</em> before the function call</p>
<p>showMessage();</p>
<p>alert( userName ); // <em>!</em>Bob<em>/!</em>, the value was modified by the function ```</p>
<p>The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one.</p>
<p>If a same-named variable is declared inside the function then it <em>shadows</em> the outer one. For instance, in the code below the function uses the local <code>userName</code>. The outer one is ignored:</p>
<p>```js run let userName = ‘John’;</p>
<p>function showMessage() { <em>!</em> let userName = “Bob”; // declare a local variable <em>/!</em></p>
<p>let message = ‘Hello,’ + userName; // <em>!</em>Bob<em>/!</em> alert(message); }</p>
<p>// the function will create and use its own userName showMessage();</p>
<p>alert( userName ); // <em>!</em>John<em>/!</em>, unchanged, the function did not access the outer variable ```</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Global variables" Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer</code>userName` in the code above, are called <em>global</em>.</p>
<p>Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals).</p>
<p>It’s a good practice to minimize the use of global variables. Modern code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their functions. Sometimes though, they can be useful to store project-level data. ```</p>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p>We can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters (also called <em>function arguments</em>) .</p>
<p>In the example below, the function has two parameters: <code>from</code> and <code>text</code>.</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage(<em>!</em>from, text<em>/!</em>) { // arguments: from, text alert(from + ‘:’ + text); }</p>
<p><em>!</em> showMessage(‘Ann’, ‘Hello!’); // Ann: Hello! (*) showMessage(‘Ann’, “What’s up?”); // Ann: What’s up? (**) <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>When the function is called in lines <code>(*)</code> and <code>(**)</code>, the given values are copied to local variables <code>from</code> and <code>text</code>. Then the function uses them.</p>
<p>Here’s one more example: we have a variable <code>from</code> and pass it to the function. Please note: the function changes <code>from</code>, but the change is not seen outside, because a function always gets a copy of the value:</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage(from, text) {</p>
<p><em>!</em> from = ‘<em>’ + from + ’</em>’; // make “from” look nicer <em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert( from + ‘:’ + text ); }</p>
<p>let from = “Ann”;</p>
<p>showMessage(from, “Hello”); // <em>Ann</em>: Hello</p>
<p>// the value of “from” is the same, the function modified a local copy alert( from ); // Ann ```</p>
<h2 id="default-values">Default values</h2>
<p>If a parameter is not provided, then its value becomes <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, the aforementioned function <code>showMessage(from, text)</code> can be called with a single argument:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb108"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb108-1" title="1"><span class="at">showMessage</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Ann&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s not an error. Such a call would output <code>"*Ann*: undefined"</code>. There’s no <code>text</code>, so it’s assumed that <code>text === undefined</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to use a “default” <code>text</code> in this case, then we can specify it after <code>=</code>:</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage(from, <em>!</em>text = “no text given”<em>/!</em>) { alert( from + “:” + text ); }</p>
<p>showMessage(“Ann”); // Ann: no text given ```</p>
<p>Now if the <code>text</code> parameter is not passed, it will get the value <code>"no text given"</code></p>
<p>Here <code>"no text given"</code> is a string, but it can be a more complex expression, which is only evaluated and assigned if the parameter is missing. So, this is also possible:</p>
<p><code>js run function showMessage(from, text = anotherFunction()) {   // anotherFunction() only executed if no text given   // its result becomes the value of text }</code></p>
<p>```smart header=“Evaluation of default parameters” In JavaScript, a default parameter is evaluated every time the function is called without the respective parameter.</p>
<p>In the example above, <code>anotherFunction()</code> is called every time <code>showMessage()</code> is called without the <code>text</code> parameter. ```</p>
<h3 id="alternative-default-parameters">Alternative default parameters</h3>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense to set default values for parameters not in the function declaration, but at a later stage, during its execution.</p>
<p>To check for an omitted parameter, we can compare it with <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<p>```js run function showMessage(text) { <em>!</em> if (text === undefined) { text = ‘empty message’; } <em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert(text); }</p>
<p>showMessage(); // empty message ```</p>
<p>…Or we could use the <code>||</code> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb109"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-1" title="1"><span class="co">// if text parameter is omitted or &quot;&quot; is passed, set it to &#39;empty&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-2" title="2"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">showMessage</span>(text) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-3" title="3">  text <span class="op">=</span> text <span class="op">||</span> <span class="st">&#39;empty&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-4" title="4">  ...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Modern JavaScript engines support the <a href="info:nullish-coalescing-operator">nullish coalescing operator</a> <code>??</code>, it’s better when falsy values, such as <code>0</code>, are considered regular:</p>
<p>```js run // if there’s no “count” parameter, show “unknown” function showCount(count) { alert(count ?? “unknown”); }</p>
<p>showCount(0); // 0 showCount(null); // unknown showCount(); // unknown ```</p>
<h2 id="returning-a-value">Returning a value</h2>
<p>A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.</p>
<p>The simplest example would be a function that sums two values:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify function sum(a, b) { <em>!</em>return<em>/!</em> a + b; }</p>
<p>let result = sum(1, 2); alert( result ); // 3 ```</p>
<p>The directive <code>return</code> can be in any place of the function. When the execution reaches it, the function stops, and the value is returned to the calling code (assigned to <code>result</code> above).</p>
<p>There may be many occurrences of <code>return</code> in a single function. For instance:</p>
<p>```js run function checkAge(age) { if (age &gt;= 18) { <em>!</em> return true; <em>/!</em> } else { <em>!</em> return confirm(‘Do you have permission from your parents?’); <em>/!</em> } }</p>
<p>let age = prompt(‘How old are you?’, 18);</p>
<p>if ( checkAge(age) ) { alert( ‘Access granted’ ); } else { alert( ‘Access denied’ ); } ```</p>
<p>It is possible to use <code>return</code> without a value. That causes the function to exit immediately.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb110"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">showMovie</span>(age) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> ( <span class="op">!</span><span class="at">checkAge</span>(age) ) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-3" title="3"><span class="op">*!*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-4" title="4">    <span class="cf">return</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-5" title="5"><span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-6" title="6"><span class="ss">  }</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-8" title="8"><span class="ss">  alert</span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss"> &quot;Showing you the movie&quot; </span><span class="sc">)</span><span class="ss">; // </span><span class="sc">(*)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-9" title="9"><span class="ss">  // ...</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-10" title="10"><span class="ss">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the code above, if <code>checkAge(age)</code> returns <code>false</code>, then <code>showMovie</code> won’t proceed to the <code>alert</code>.</p>
<p>```<code>smart header="A function with an empty</code>return<code>or without it returns</code>undefined<code>" If a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns</code>undefined`:</p>
<p>```js run function doNothing() { /* empty */ }</p>
<p>alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true ```</p>
<p>An empty <code>return</code> is also the same as <code>return undefined</code>:</p>
<p>```js run function doNothing() { return; }</p>
<p>alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>```<code>warn header="Never add a newline between</code>return<code>and the value" For a long expression in</code>return`, it might be tempting to put it on a separate line, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb112"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-1" title="1"><span class="cf">return</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-2" title="2">some <span class="op">+</span> long <span class="op">+</span> expression <span class="op">+</span> or <span class="op">+</span> whatever <span class="op">*</span> <span class="at">f</span>(a) <span class="op">+</span> <span class="at">f</span>(b)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>That doesn’t work, because JavaScript assumes a semicolon after <code>return</code>. That’ll work the same as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb113"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb113-1" title="1"><span class="cf">return</span><span class="op">*!*;*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb113-2" title="2"><span class="ss"> </span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss">some </span><span class="sc">+</span><span class="ss"> long </span><span class="sc">+</span><span class="ss"> expression </span><span class="sc">+</span><span class="ss"> or </span><span class="sc">+</span><span class="ss"> whatever </span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss"> f</span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss">a</span><span class="sc">)</span><span class="ss"> </span><span class="sc">+</span><span class="ss"> f</span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss">b</span><span class="sc">))</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So, it effectively becomes an empty return.</p>
<p>If we want the returned expression to wrap across multiple lines, we should start it at the same line as <code>return</code>. Or at least put the opening parentheses there as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb114"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb114-1" title="1"><span class="cf">return</span> some <span class="op">+</span> long <span class="op">+</span> expression <span class="op">+</span> or <span class="op">+</span> whatever <span class="op">*</span> <span class="at">f</span>(a) <span class="op">+</span> <span class="at">f</span>(b)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And it will work just as we expect it to.</p>
<pre><code>
## Naming a function [#function-naming]

Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

For instance, functions that start with `&quot;show&quot;` usually show something.

Function starting with...

- `&quot;get…&quot;` -- return a value,
- `&quot;calc…&quot;` -- calculate something,
- `&quot;create…&quot;` -- create something,
- `&quot;check…&quot;` -- check something and return a boolean, etc.

Examples of such names:

```js no-beautify
showMessage(..)     // shows a message
getAge(..)          // returns the age (gets it somehow)
calcSum(..)         // calculates a sum and returns the result
createForm(..)      // creates a form (and usually returns it)
checkPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false
```

With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it returns.

```smart header=&quot;One function -- one action&quot;
A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.

Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).

A few examples of breaking this rule:

- `getAge` -- would be bad if it shows an `alert` with the age (should only get).
- `createForm` -- would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return).
- `checkPermission` -- would be bad if it displays the `access granted/denied` message (should only perform the check and return the result).

These examples assume common meanings of prefixes. You and your team are free to agree on other meanings, but usually they&#39;re not much different. In any case, you should have a firm understanding of what a prefix means, what a prefixed function can and cannot do. All same-prefixed functions should obey the rules. And the team should share the knowledge.
```

```smart header=&quot;Ultrashort function names&quot;
Functions that are used *very often* sometimes have ultrashort names.

For example, the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) framework defines a function with `$`. The [Lodash](http://lodash.com/) library has its core function named `_`.

These are exceptions. Generally function names should be concise and descriptive.
```

## Functions == Comments

Functions should be short and do exactly one thing. If that thing is big, maybe it&#39;s worth it to split the function into a few smaller functions. Sometimes following this rule may not be that easy, but it&#39;s definitely a good thing.

A separate function is not only easier to test and debug -- its very existence is a great comment!

For instance, compare the two functions `showPrimes(n)` below. Each one outputs [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to `n`.

The first variant uses a label:

```js
function showPrimes(n) {
  nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {

    for (let j = 2; j &lt; i; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
    }

    alert( i ); // a prime
  }
}
```

The second variant uses an additional function `isPrime(n)` to test for primality:

```js
function showPrimes(n) {

  for (let i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {
    *!*if (!isPrime(i)) continue;*/!*

    alert(i);  // a prime
  }
}

function isPrime(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {
    if ( n % i == 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

The second variant is easier to understand, isn&#39;t it? Instead of the code piece we see a name of the action (`isPrime`). Sometimes people refer to such code as *self-describing*.

So, functions can be created even if we don&#39;t intend to reuse them. They structure the code and make it readable.

## Summary

A function declaration looks like this:

```js
function name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {
  /* code */
}
```

- Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.
- A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn&#39;t see its local variables.
- A function can return a value. If it doesn&#39;t, then its result is `undefined`.

To make the code clean and easy to understand, it&#39;s recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters in the function, not outer variables.

It is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side-effect.

Function naming:

- A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns.
- A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.
- There exist many well-known function prefixes like `create…`, `show…`, `get…`, `check…` and so on. Use them to hint what a function does.

Functions are the main building blocks of scripts. Now we&#39;ve covered the basics, so we actually can start creating and using them. But that&#39;s only the beginning of the path. We are going to return to them many times, going more deeply into their advanced features.

# Manuals and specifications

This book is a *tutorial*. It aims to help you gradually learn the language. But once you&#39;re familiar with the basics, you&#39;ll need other sources.

## Specification

[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.

But being that formalized, it&#39;s difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it&#39;s not for everyday use.

A new specification version is released every year. In-between these releases, the latest specification draft is at &lt;https://tc39.es/ecma262/&gt;.

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are &quot;almost standard&quot; (so-called &quot;stage 3&quot;), see proposals at &lt;https://github.com/tc39/proposals&gt;.

Also, if you&#39;re developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](info:browser-environment) of the tutorial.

## Manuals

- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is the main manual with examples and other information. It&#39;s great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.

    One can find it at &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference&gt;.

Although, it&#39;s often best to use an internet search instead. Just use &quot;MDN [term]&quot; in the query, e.g. &lt;https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt&gt; to search for `parseInt` function.

## Compatibility tables

JavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.

To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:

- &lt;http://caniuse.com&gt; - per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: &lt;http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography&gt;.
- &lt;https://kangax.github.io/compat-table&gt; - a table with language features and engines that support those or don&#39;t support.

All these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support etc.

Please remember them (or this page) for the cases when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.
# Function expressions

In JavaScript, a function is not a &quot;magical language structure&quot;, but a special kind of value.

The syntax that we used before is called a *Function Declaration*:

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( &quot;Hello&quot; );
}
```

There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a *Function Expression*.

It looks like this:

```js
let sayHi = function() {
  alert( &quot;Hello&quot; );
};
```

Here, the function is created and assigned to the variable explicitly, like any other value. No matter how the function is defined, it&#39;s just a value stored in the variable `sayHi`.

The meaning of these code samples is the same: &quot;create a function and put it into the variable `sayHi`&quot;.

We can even print out that value using `alert`:

```js run
function sayHi() {
  alert( &quot;Hello&quot; );
}

*!*
alert( sayHi ); // shows the function code
*/!*
```

Please note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after `sayHi`. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.

In JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.

Surely, a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like `sayHi()`.

But it&#39;s still a value. So we can work with it like with other kinds of values.

We can copy a function to another variable:

```js run no-beautify
function sayHi() {   // (1) create
  alert( &quot;Hello&quot; );
}

let func = sayHi;    // (2) copy

func(); // Hello     // (3) run the copy (it works)!
sayHi(); // Hello    //     this still works too (why wouldn&#39;t it)
```

Here&#39;s what happens above in detail:

1. The Function Declaration `(1)` creates the function and puts it into the variable named `sayHi`.
2. Line `(2)` copies it into the variable `func`. Please note again: there are no parentheses after `sayHi`. If there were, then `func = sayHi()` would write  *the result of the call* `sayHi()` into `func`, not *the function* `sayHi` itself.
3. Now the function can be called as both `sayHi()` and `func()`.

Note that we could also have used a Function Expression to declare `sayHi`, in the first line:

```js
let sayHi = function() {
  alert( &quot;Hello&quot; );
};

let func = sayHi;
// ...
```

Everything would work the same.


````smart header=&quot;Why is there a semicolon at the end?&quot;
You might wonder, why does Function Expression have a semicolon `;` at the end, but Function Declaration does not:

```js
function sayHi() {
  // ...
}

let sayHi = function() {
  // ...
}*!*;*/!*
```

The answer is simple:
- There&#39;s no need for `;` at the end of code blocks and syntax structures that use them like `if { ... }`, `for {  }`, `function f { }` etc.
- A Function Expression is used inside the statement: `let sayHi = ...;`, as a value. It&#39;s not a code block, but rather an assignment. The semicolon `;` is recommended at the end of statements, no matter what the value is. So the semicolon here is not related to the Function Expression itself, it just terminates the statement.</code></pre>
<h2 id="callback-functions">Callback functions</h2>
<p>Let’s look at more examples of passing functions as values and using function expressions.</p>
<p>We’ll write a function <code>ask(question, yes, no)</code> with three parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>question</code></dt>
<dd>Text of the question
</dd>
<dt><code>yes</code></dt>
<dd>Function to run if the answer is “Yes”
</dd>
<dt><code>no</code></dt>
<dd>Function to run if the answer is “No”
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The function should ask the <code>question</code> and, depending on the user’s answer, call <code>yes()</code> or <code>no()</code>:</p>
<p>```js run <em>!</em> function ask(question, yes, no) { if (confirm(question)) yes() else no(); } <em>/!</em></p>
<p>function showOk() { alert( “You agreed.” ); }</p>
<p>function showCancel() { alert( “You canceled the execution.” ); }</p>
<p>// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask ask(“Do you agree?”, showOk, showCancel); ```</p>
<p>In practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life <code>ask</code> and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple <code>confirm</code>. In the browser, such function usually draws a nice-looking question window. But that’s another story.</p>
<p><strong>The arguments <code>showOk</code> and <code>showCancel</code> of <code>ask</code> are called <em>callback functions</em> or just <em>callbacks</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, <code>showOk</code> becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and <code>showCancel</code> for “no” answer.</p>
<p>We can use Function Expressions to write the same function much shorter:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify function ask(question, yes, no) { if (confirm(question)) yes() else no(); }</p>
<p><em>!</em> ask( “Do you agree?”, function() { alert(“You agreed.”); }, function() { alert(“You canceled the execution.”); } ); <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Here, functions are declared right inside the <code>ask(...)</code> call. They have no name, and so are called <em>anonymous</em>. Such functions are not accessible outside of <code>ask</code> (because they are not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.</p>
<p>Such code appears in our scripts very naturally, it’s in the spirit of JavaScript.</p>
<p>```smart header=“A function is a value representing an”action"" Regular values like strings or numbers represent the <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>A function can be perceived as an <em>action</em>.</p>
<p>We can pass it between variables and run when we want. ```</p>
<h2 id="function-expression-vs-function-declaration">Function Expression vs Function Declaration</h2>
<p>Let’s formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.</p>
<p>First, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Function Declaration:</em> a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb116"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb116-1" title="1"><span class="co">// Function Declaration</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb116-2" title="2"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">sum</span>(a<span class="op">,</span> b) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb116-3" title="3">  <span class="cf">return</span> a <span class="op">+</span> b<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb116-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><em>Function Expression:</em> a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created at the right side of the “assignment expression” <code>=</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb117"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb117-1" title="1"><span class="co">// Function Expression</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb117-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> sum <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span> (a<span class="op">,</span> b) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb117-3" title="3">  <span class="cf">return</span> a <span class="op">+</span> b<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb117-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>The more subtle difference is <em>when</em> a function is created by the JavaScript engine.</p>
<p><strong>A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.</strong></p>
<p>Once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment <code>let sum = function…</code> – here we go, the function is created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.</p>
<p>Function Declarations are different.</p>
<p><strong>A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.</strong></p>
<p>For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.</p>
<p>That’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.</p>
<p>And after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.</p>
<p>For example, this works:</p>
<p>```js run refresh untrusted <em>!</em> sayHi(“John”); // Hello, John <em>/!</em></p>
<p>function sayHi(name) { alert( <code>Hello, ${name}</code> ); } ```</p>
<p>The Function Declaration <code>sayHi</code> is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script and is visible everywhere in it.</p>
<p>…If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn’t work:</p>
<p>```js run refresh untrusted <em>!</em> sayHi(“John”); // error! <em>/!</em></p>
<p>let sayHi = function(name) { // (*) no magic any more alert( <code>Hello, ${name}</code> ); }; ```</p>
<p>Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in the line <code>(*)</code>. Too late.</p>
<p>Another special feature of Function Declarations is their block scope.</p>
<p><strong>In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, let’s imagine that we need to declare a function <code>welcome()</code> depending on the <code>age</code> variable that we get during runtime. And then we plan to use it some time later.</p>
<p>If we use Function Declaration, it won’t work as intended:</p>
<p>```js run let age = prompt(“What is your age?”, 18);</p>
<p>// conditionally declare a function if (age &lt; 18) {</p>
<p>function welcome() { alert(“Hello!”); }</p>
<p>} else {</p>
<p>function welcome() { alert(“Greetings!”); }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// …use it later <em>!</em> welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>That’s because a Function Declaration is only visible inside the code block in which it resides.</p>
<p>Here’s another example:</p>
<p>```js run let age = 16; // take 16 as an example</p>
<p>if (age &lt; 18) { <em>!</em> welcome(); //   (runs) <em>/!</em> // | function welcome() { // | alert(“Hello!”); // | Function Declaration is available } // | everywhere in the block where it’s declared // | <em>!</em> welcome(); // / (runs) <em>/!</em></p>
<p>} else {</p>
<p>function welcome() { alert(“Greetings!”); } }</p>
<p>// Here we’re out of curly braces, // so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.</p>
<p><em>!</em> welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>What can we do to make <code>welcome</code> visible outside of <code>if</code>?</p>
<p>The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign <code>welcome</code> to the variable that is declared outside of <code>if</code> and has the proper visibility.</p>
<p>This code works as intended:</p>
<p>```js run let age = prompt(“What is your age?”, 18);</p>
<p>let welcome;</p>
<p>if (age &lt; 18) {</p>
<p>welcome = function() { alert(“Hello!”); };</p>
<p>} else {</p>
<p>welcome = function() { alert(“Greetings!”); };</p>
<p>}</p>
<p><em>!</em> welcome(); // ok now <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Or we could simplify it even further using a question mark operator <code>?</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let age = prompt(“What is your age?”, 18);</p>
<p>let welcome = (age &lt; 18) ? function() { alert(“Hello!”); } : function() { alert(“Greetings!”); };</p>
<p><em>!</em> welcome(); // ok now <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>```smart header=“When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?” As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.</p>
<p>That’s also better for readability, as it’s easier to look up <code>function f(…) {…}</code> in the code than <code>let f = function(…) {…};</code>. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.</p>
<p>…But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (we’ve just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used. ```</p>
<h2 id="summary-15">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.</li>
<li>If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.</li>
<li>If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.</li>
<li>Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.</li>
<li>Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.</p>
<p>So we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We’ve seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, and will see more in the future.</p>
<h1 id="arrow-functions-the-basics">Arrow functions, the basics</h1>
<p>There’s another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that’s often better than Function Expressions.</p>
<p>It’s called “arrow functions”, because it looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb118"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb118-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> func <span class="op">=</span> (arg1<span class="op">,</span> arg2<span class="op">,</span> ...<span class="op">,</span> argN) <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> expression</a></code></pre></div>
<p>…This creates a function <code>func</code> that accepts arguments <code>arg1..argN</code>, then evaluates the <code>expression</code> on the right side with their use and returns its result.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s the shorter version of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb119"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb119-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> func <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(arg1<span class="op">,</span> arg2<span class="op">,</span> ...<span class="op">,</span> argN) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb119-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">return</span> expression<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb119-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s see a concrete example:</p>
<p>```js run let sum = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;</p>
<p>/* This arrow function is a shorter form of:</p>
<p>let sum = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; */</p>
<p>alert(sum(1, 2)); // 3 ```</p>
<p>As you can, see <code>(a, b) =&gt; a + b</code> means a function that accepts two arguments named <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression <code>a + b</code> and returns the result.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making that even shorter.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>```js run <em>!</em> let double = n =&gt; n * 2; // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { return n * 2 } <em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert( double(3) ); // 6 ```</p></li>
<li><p>If there are no arguments, parentheses will be empty (but they should be present):</p>
<p>```js run let sayHi = () =&gt; alert(“Hello!”);</p>
<p>sayHi(); ```</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.</p>
<p>For instance, to dynamically create a function:</p>
<p>```js run let age = prompt(“What is your age?”, 18);</p>
<p>let welcome = age &lt; 18 ? () =&gt; alert(“Hello”) : () =&gt; alert(“Greetings!”);</p>
<p>welcome(); ```</p>
<p>Arrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but that quickly changes as the eyes get used to the structure.</p>
<p>They are very convenient for simple one-line actions, when we’re just too lazy to write many words.</p>
<h2 id="multiline-arrow-functions">Multiline arrow functions</h2>
<p>The examples above took arguments from the left of <code>=&gt;</code> and evaluated the right-side expression with them.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need something a little bit more complex, like multiple expressions or statements. It is also possible, but we should enclose them in curly braces. Then use a normal <code>return</code> within them.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>```js run let sum = (a, b) =&gt; { // the curly brace opens a multiline function let result = a + b; <em>!</em> return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit “return” <em>/!</em> };</p>
<p>alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3 ```</p>
<p>```smart header=“More to come” Here we praised arrow functions for brevity. But that’s not all!</p>
<p>Arrow functions have other interesting features.</p>
<p>To study them in-depth, we first need to get to know some other aspects of JavaScript, so we’ll return to arrow functions later in the chapter <a href="info:arrow-functions" class="uri">info:arrow-functions</a>.</p>
<p>For now, we can already use arrow functions for one-line actions and callbacks. ```</p>
<h2 id="summary-16">Summary</h2>
<p>Arrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Without curly braces: <code>(...args) =&gt; expression</code> – the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.</li>
<li>With curly braces: <code>(...args) =&gt; { body }</code> – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit <code>return</code> to return something.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="javascript-specials">JavaScript specials</h1>
<p>This chapter briefly recaps the features of JavaScript that we’ve learned by now, paying special attention to subtle moments.</p>
<h2 id="code-structure">Code structure</h2>
<p>Statements are delimited with a semicolon:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert("Hello"); alert("World");</code></p>
<p>Usually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert("Hello"); alert("World");</code></p>
<p>That’s called “automatic semicolon insertion”. Sometimes it doesn’t work, for instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert("There will be an error after this message")[(1, 2)].forEach(alert);</code></p>
<p>Most codestyle guides agree that we should put a semicolon after each statement.</p>
<p>Semicolons are not required after code blocks <code>{...}</code> and syntax constructs with them like loops:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb120"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">f</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// no semicolon needed after function declaration</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-5" title="5"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="op">;;</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-6" title="6">  <span class="co">// no semicolon needed after the loop</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>…But even if we can put an “extra” semicolon somewhere, that’s not an error. It will be ignored.</p>
<p>More in: <a href="info:structure" class="uri">info:structure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="strict-mode">Strict mode</h2>
<p>To fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with <code>"use strict"</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb121"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb121-1" title="1"><span class="st">&#39;use strict&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb121-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb121-3" title="3">...</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The directive must be at the top of a script or at the beginning of a function body.</p>
<p>Without <code>"use strict"</code>, everything still works, but some features behave in the old-fashion, “compatible” way. We’d generally prefer the modern behavior.</p>
<p>Some modern features of the language (like classes that we’ll study in the future) enable strict mode implicitly.</p>
<p>More in: <a href="info:strict-mode" class="uri">info:strict-mode</a>.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Can be declared using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>let</code></li>
<li><code>const</code> (constant, can’t be changed)</li>
<li><code>var</code> (old-style, will see later)</li>
</ul>
<p>A variable name can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letters and digits, but the first character may not be a digit.</li>
<li>Characters <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> are normal, on par with letters.</li>
<li>Non-Latin alphabets and hieroglyphs are also allowed, but commonly not used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables are dynamically typed. They can store any value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb122"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb122-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb122-2" title="2">x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>There are 8 data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>number</code> for both floating-point and integer numbers,</li>
<li><code>bigint</code> for integer numbers of arbitrary length,</li>
<li><code>string</code> for strings,</li>
<li><code>boolean</code> for logical values: <code>true/false</code>,</li>
<li><code>null</code> – a type with a single value <code>null</code>, meaning “empty” or “does not exist”,</li>
<li><code>undefined</code> – a type with a single value <code>undefined</code>, meaning “not assigned”,</li>
<li><code>object</code> and <code>symbol</code> – for complex data structures and unique identifiers, we haven’t learnt them yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator returns the type for a value, with two exceptions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb123"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-1" title="1"><span class="kw">typeof</span> <span class="kw">null</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;object&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// error in the language</span></a>

<p>More in: <a href="info:variables" class="uri">info:variables</a> and <a href="info:types" class="uri">info:types</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
<p>We’re using a browser as a working environment, so basic UI functions will be:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="mdn:api/Window/prompt"><code>prompt(question, [default])</code></a></dt>
<dd>Ask a <code>question</code>, and return either what the visitor entered or <code>null</code> if they clicked “cancel”.
</dd>
<dt><a href="mdn:api/Window/confirm"><code>confirm(question)</code></a></dt>
<dd>Ask a <code>question</code> and suggest to choose between Ok and Cancel. The choice is returned as <code>true/false</code>.
</dd>
<dt><a href="mdn:api/Window/alert"><code>alert(message)</code></a></dt>
<dd>Output a <code>message</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All these functions are <em>modal</em>, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from interacting with the page until they answer.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let userName = prompt(“Your name?”, “Alice”); let isTeaWanted = confirm(“Do you want some tea?”);</p>
<p>alert(“Visitor:” + userName); // Alice alert(“Tea wanted:” + isTeaWanted); // true ```</p>
<p>More in: <a href="info:alert-prompt-confirm" class="uri">info:alert-prompt-confirm</a>.</p>
<h2 id="operators">Operators</h2>
<p>JavaScript supports the following operators:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Arithmetical</dt>
<dd><p>Regular: <code>* + - /</code>, also <code>%</code> for the remainder and <code>**</code> for power of a number.</p>
<p>The binary plus <code>+</code> concatenates strings. And if any of the operands is a string, the other one is converted to string too:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( '1' + 2 ); // '12', string alert( 1 + '2' ); // '12', string</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>There is a simple assignment: <code>a = b</code> and combined ones like <code>a *= 2</code>.
</dd>
<dt>Bitwise</dt>
<dd>Bitwise operators work with 32-bit integers at the lowest, bit-level: see the <a href="mdn:/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Bitwise">docs</a> when they are needed.
</dd>
<dt>Conditional</dt>
<dd>The only operator with three parameters: <code>cond ? resultA : resultB</code>. If <code>cond</code> is truthy, returns <code>resultA</code>, otherwise <code>resultB</code>.
</dd>
<dt>Logical operators</dt>
<dd>Logical AND <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and OR <code>||</code> perform short-circuit evaluation and then return the value where it stopped (not necessary <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>). Logical NOT <code>!</code> converts the operand to boolean type and returns the inverse value.
</dd>
<dt>Nullish coalescing operator</dt>
<dd>The <code>??</code> operator provides a way to choose a defined value from a list of variables. The result of <code>a ?? b</code> is <code>a</code> unless it’s <code>null/undefined</code>, then <code>b</code>.
</dd>
<dt>Comparisons</dt>
<dd><p>Equality check <code>==</code> for values of different types converts them to a number (except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> that equal each other and nothing else), so these are equal:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 0 == false ); // true alert( 0 == '' ); // true</code></p>
<p>Other comparisons convert to a number as well.</p>
<p>The strict equality operator <code>===</code> doesn’t do the conversion: different types always mean different values for it.</p>
<p>Values <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are special: they equal <code>==</code> each other and don’t equal anything else.</p>
<p>Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted to a number.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Other operators</dt>
<dd>There are few others, like a comma operator.
</dd>

<li>The variable declared in <code>for(let...)</code> loop is visible only inside the loop. But we can also omit <code>let</code> and reuse an existing variable.</li>
<li><p>Directives <code>break/continue</code> allow to exit the whole loop/current iteration. Use labels to break nested loops.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Details in: <a href="info:while-for" class="uri">info:while-for</a>.</p>
<p>Later we’ll study more types of loops to deal with objects.</p>
<h2 id="the-switch-construct">The “switch” construct</h2>
<p>The “switch” construct can replace multiple <code>if</code> checks. It uses <code>===</code> (strict equality) for comparisons.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let age = prompt(“Your age?”, 18);</p>
<p>switch (age) { case 18: alert(“Won’t work”); // the result of prompt is a string, not a number break;</p>
<p>case “18”: alert(“This works!”); break;</p>
<p>default: alert(“Any value not equal to one above”); } ```</p>
<p>Details in: <a href="info:switch" class="uri">info:switch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>We covered three ways to create a function in JavaScript:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow</p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Functions may have local variables: those declared inside its body or its parameter list. Such variables are only visible inside the function.</li>
<li>Parameters can have default values: <code>function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}</code>.</li>
<li>Functions always return something. If there’s no <code>return</code> statement, then the result is <code>undefined</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="more-to-come">More to come</h2>
<p>That was a brief list of JavaScript features. As of now we’ve studied only basics. Further in the tutorial you’ll find more specials and advanced features of JavaScript.</p>
<h1 id="debugging-in-chrome">Debugging in Chrome</h1>
<p>Before writing more complex code, let’s talk about debugging.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">Debugging</a> is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. All modern browsers and most other environments support debugging tools – a special UI in developer tools that makes debugging much easier. It also allows to trace the code step by step to see what exactly is going on.</p>
<p>We’ll be using Chrome here, because it has enough features, most other browsers have a similar process.</p>
<h2 id="the-sources-panel">The “Sources” panel</h2>
<p>Your Chrome version may look a little bit different, but it still should be obvious what’s there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <a href="debugging/index.html">example page</a> in Chrome.</li>
<li>Turn on developer tools with <code>key:F12</code> (Mac: <code>key:Cmd+Opt+I</code>).</li>
<li>Select the <code>Sources</code> panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what you should see if you are doing it for the first time:</p>
<p><img src="chrome-open-sources.svg" /></p>
<p>The toggler button <span class="devtools" style="background-position:-172px -98px"></span> opens the tab with files.</p>
<p>Let’s click it and select <code>hello.js</code> in the tree view. Here’s what should show up:</p>
<p><img src="chrome-tabs.svg" /></p>
<p>The Sources panel has 3 parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong>File Navigator</strong> pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.</li>
<li>The <strong>Code Editor</strong> pane shows the source code.</li>
<li>The <strong>JavaScript Debugging</strong> pane is for debugging, we’ll explore it soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you could click the same toggler <span class="devtools" style="background-position:-172px -122px"></span> again to hide the resources list and give the code some space.</p>
<h2 id="console">Console</h2>
<p>If we press <code>key:Esc</code>, then a console opens below. We can type commands there and press <code>key:Enter</code> to execute.</p>
<p>After a statement is executed, its result is shown below.</p>
<p>For example, here <code>1+2</code> results in <code>3</code>, and <code>hello("debugger")</code> returns nothing, so the result is <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<p><img src="chrome-sources-console.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Let’s examine what’s going on within the code of the <a href="debugging/index.html">example page</a>. In <code>hello.js</code>, click at line number <code>4</code>. Yes, right on the <code>4</code> digit, not on the code.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve set a breakpoint. Please also click on the number for line <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>It should look like this (blue is where you should click):</p>
<p><img src="chrome-sources-breakpoint.svg" /></p>
<p>A <em>breakpoint</em> is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.</p>
<p>While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it.</p>
<p>We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That’s useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on it in the right panel).</li>
<li>Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.</li>
<li>Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.</li>
<li>…And so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>```smart header=“Conditional breakpoints” <em>Right click</em> on the line number allows to create a <em>conditional</em> breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression is truthy.</p>
<p>That’s handy when we need to stop only for a certain variable value or for certain function parameters. ```</p>
<h2 id="debugger-command">Debugger command</h2>
<p>We can also pause the code by using the <code>debugger</code> command in it, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb128"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">hello</span>(name) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">let</span> phrase <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`Hello, </span><span class="sc">${</span>name<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs">!`</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-4" title="4"><span class="op">*!*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-5" title="5">  <span class="cf">debugger</span><span class="op">;</span>  <span class="co">// &lt;-- the debugger stops here</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-6" title="6"><span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-8" title="8"><span class="ss">  say</span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss">phrase</span><span class="sc">)</span><span class="ss">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-9" title="9"><span class="ss">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s very convenient when we are in a code editor and don’t want to switch to the browser and look up the script in developer tools to set the breakpoint.</p>
<h2 id="pause-and-look-around">Pause and look around</h2>
<p>In our example, <code>hello()</code> is called during the page load, so the easiest way to activate the debugger (after we’ve set the breakpoints) is to reload the page. So let’s press <code>key:F5</code> (Windows, Linux) or <code>key:Cmd+R</code> (Mac).</p>
<p>As the breakpoint is set, the execution pauses at the 4th line:</p>
<p><img src="chrome-sources-debugger-pause.svg" /></p>
<p>Please open the informational dropdowns to the right (labeled with arrows). They allow you to examine the current code state:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><code>Watch</code> – shows current values for any expressions.</strong></p>
<p>You can click the plus <code>+</code> and input an expression. The debugger will show its value at any moment, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Call Stack</code> – shows the nested calls chain.</strong></p>
<p>At the current moment the debugger is inside <code>hello()</code> call, called by a script in <code>index.html</code> (no function there, so it’s called “anonymous”).</p>
<p>If you click on a stack item (e.g. “anonymous”), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, and all its variables can be examined as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Scope</code> – current variables.</strong></p>
<p><code>Local</code> shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.</p>
<p><code>Global</code> has global variables (out of any functions).</p>
<p>There’s also <code>this</code> keyword there that we didn’t study yet, but we’ll do that soon.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tracing-the-execution">Tracing the execution</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to <em>trace</em> the script.</p>
<p>There are buttons for it at the top of the right panel. Let’s engage them.</p>
<!-- https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend/blob/master/front_end/Images/src/largeIcons.svg -->
<dl>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-146px -168px"></span> – “Resume”: continue the execution, hotkey <code>key:F8</code>.</dt>
<dd><p>Resumes the execution. If there are no additional breakpoints, then the execution just continues and the debugger loses control.</p>
<p>Here’s what we can see after a click on it:</p>
<p><img src="chrome-sources-debugger-trace-1.svg" /></p>
<p>The execution has resumed, reached another breakpoint inside <code>say()</code> and paused there. Take a look at the “Call Stack” at the right. It has increased by one more call. We’re inside <code>say()</code> now.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-200px -190px"></span> – “Step”: run the next command, hotkey <code>key:F9</code>.</dt>
<dd><p>Run the next statement. If we click it now, <code>alert</code> will be shown.</p>
<p>Clicking this again and again will step through all script statements one by one.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-62px -192px"></span> – “Step over”: run the next command, but <em>don’t go into a function</em>, hotkey <code>key:F10</code>.</dt>
<dd><p>Similar to the previous “Step” command, but behaves differently if the next statement is a function call. That is: not a built-in, like <code>alert</code>, but a function of our own.</p>
<p>The “Step” command goes into it and pauses the execution at its first line, while “Step over” executes the nested function call invisibly, skipping the function internals.</p>
<p>The execution is then paused immediately after that function.</p>
<p>That’s good if we’re not interested to see what happens inside the function call.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-4px -194px"></span> – “Step into”, hotkey <code>key:F11</code>.</dt>
<dd><p>That’s similar to “Step”, but behaves differently in case of asynchronous function calls. If you’re only starting to learn JavaScript, then you can ignore the difference, as we don’t have asynchronous calls yet.</p>
<p>For the future, just note that “Step” command ignores async actions, such as <code>setTimeout</code> (scheduled function call), that execute later. The “Step into” goes into their code, waiting for them if necessary. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#async">DevTools manual</a> for more details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-32px -194px"></span> – “Step out”: continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey <code>key:Shift+F11</code>.</dt>
<dd>Continue the execution and stop it at the very last line of the current function. That’s handy when we accidentally entered a nested call using <span class="devtools" style="background-position:-200px -190px"></span>, but it does not interest us, and we want to continue to its end as soon as possible.
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-61px -74px"></span> – enable/disable all breakpoints.</dt>
<dd>That button does not move the execution. Just a mass on/off for breakpoints.
</dd>
<dt><span class="devtools" style="background-position:-90px -146px"></span> – enable/disable automatic pause in case of an error.</dt>
<dd>When enabled, and the developer tools is open, a script error automatically pauses the execution. Then we can analyze variables to see what went wrong. So if our script dies with an error, we can open debugger, enable this option and reload the page to see where it dies and what’s the context at that moment.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>```smart header=“Continue to here” Right click on a line of code opens the context menu with a great option called “Continue to here”.</p>
<p>That’s handy when we want to move multiple steps forward to the line, but we’re too lazy to set a breakpoint. ```</p>
<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
<p>To output something to console from our code, there’s <code>console.log</code> function.</p>
<p>For instance, this outputs values from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code> to console:</p>
<p><code>js run // open console to see for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {   console.log("value,", i); }</code></p>
<p>Regular users don’t see that output, it is in the console. To see it, either open the Console panel of developer tools or press <code>key:Esc</code> while in another panel: that opens the console at the bottom.</p>
<p>If we have enough logging in our code, then we can see what’s going on from the records, without the debugger.</p>
<h2 id="summary-17">Summary</h2>
<p>As we can see, there are three main ways to pause a script:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A breakpoint.</li>
<li>The <code>debugger</code> statements.</li>
<li>An error (if dev tools are open and the button <span class="devtools" style="background-position:-90px -146px"></span> is “on”).</li>
</ol>
<p>When paused, we can debug - examine variables and trace the code to see where the execution goes wrong.</p>
<p>There are many more options in developer tools than covered here. The full manual is at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools" class="uri">https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools</a>.</p>
<p>The information from this chapter is enough to begin debugging, but later, especially if you do a lot of browser stuff, please go there and look through more advanced capabilities of developer tools.</p>
<p>Oh, and also you can click at various places of dev tools and just see what’s showing up. That’s probably the fastest route to learn dev tools. Don’t forget about the right click and context menus!</p>
<h1 id="coding-style">Coding Style</h1>
<p>Our code must be as clean and easy to read as possible.</p>
<p>That is actually the art of programming – to take a complex task and code it in a way that is both correct and human-readable. A good code style greatly assists in that.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Here is a cheat sheet with some suggested rules (see below for more details):</p>
<p><img src="code-style.svg" /></p>
<!--
```js
function pow(x, n) {
  let result = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }

  return result;
}

let x = prompt("x?", "");
let n = prompt("n?", "");

if (n < 0) {
  alert(`Power ${n} is not supported,
    please enter a non-negative integer number`);
} else {
  alert( pow(x, n) );
}
```

-->
<p>Now let’s discuss the rules and reasons for them in detail.</p>
<p><code>warn header="There are no "you must" rules" Nothing is set in stone here. These are style preferences, not religious dogmas.</code></p>
<h3 id="curly-braces">Curly Braces</h3>
<p>In most JavaScript projects curly braces are written in “Egyptian” style with the opening brace on the same line as the corresponding keyword – not on a new line. There should also be a space before the opening bracket, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb129"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (condition) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// do this</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-3" title="3">  <span class="co">// ...and that</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-4" title="4">  <span class="co">// ...and that</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A single-line construct, such as <code>if (condition) doSomething()</code>, is an important edge case. Should we use braces at all?</p>
<p>Here are the annotated variants so you can judge their readability for yourself:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>😠 Beginners sometimes do that. Bad! Curly braces are not needed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb130"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb130-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (n <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="op">*!*{*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss">alert</span><span class="sc">(</span><span class="ss">`Power ${n} is not supported`</span><span class="sc">)</span><span class="ss">;</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss">!</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss">}</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss">/</span><span class="op">!*</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>😠 Split to a separate line without braces. Never do that, easy to make an error when adding new lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb131"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb131-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (n <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="vs">`Power </span><span class="sc">${</span>n<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs"> is not supported`</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>😏 One line without braces - acceptable, if it’s short:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb132"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb132-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (n <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="vs">`Power </span><span class="sc">${</span>n<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs"> is not supported`</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>😃 The best variant:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb133"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb133-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (n <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb133-2" title="2">  <span class="at">alert</span>(<span class="vs">`Power </span><span class="sc">${</span>n<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs"> is not supported`</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb133-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>For a very brief code, one line is allowed, e.g. <code>if (cond) return null</code>. But a code block (the last variant) is usually more readable.</p>
<h3 id="line-length">Line Length</h3>
<p>No one likes to read a long horizontal line of code. It’s best practice to split them.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb134"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-1" title="1"><span class="co">// backtick quotes ` allow to split the string into multiple lines</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> str <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-3" title="3"><span class="vs">  ECMA International&#39;s TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-4" title="4"><span class="vs">  implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-5" title="5"><span class="vs">  to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-6" title="6"><span class="vs">`</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And, for <code>if</code> statements:</p>

<p>The maximum line length should be agreed upon at the team-level. It’s usually 80 or 120 characters.</p>
<h3 id="indents">Indents</h3>
<p>There are two types of indents:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Horizontal indents: 2 or 4 spaces.</strong></p>
<p>A horizontal indentation is made using either 2 or 4 spaces or the horizontal tab symbol (key <code>key:Tab</code>). Which one to choose is an old holy war. Spaces are more common nowadays.</p>
<p>One advantage of spaces over tabs is that spaces allow more flexible configurations of indents than the tab symbol.</p>
<p>For instance, we can align the parameters with the opening bracket, like this:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify show(parameters,      aligned, // 5 spaces padding at the left      one,      after,      another   ) {   // ... }</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vertical indents: empty lines for splitting code into logical blocks.</strong></p>
<p>Even a single function can often be divided into logical blocks. In the example below, the initialization of variables, the main loop and returning the result are split vertically:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb136"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb136-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pow</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> n) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb136-9" title="9"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Insert an extra newline where it helps to make the code more readable. There should not be more than nine lines of code without a vertical indentation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="semicolons">Semicolons</h3>
<p>A semicolon should be present after each statement, even if it could possibly be skipped.</p>
<p>There are languages where a semicolon is truly optional and it is rarely used. In JavaScript, though, there are cases where a line break is not interpreted as a semicolon, leaving the code vulnerable to errors. See more about that in the chapter <a href="info:structure#semicolon" class="uri">info:structure#semicolon</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced JavaScript programmer, you may choose a no-semicolon code style like <a href="https://standardjs.com/">StandardJS</a>. Otherwise, it’s best to use semicolons to avoid possible pitfalls. The majority of developers put semicolons.</p>
<h3 id="nesting-levels">Nesting Levels</h3>
<p>Try to avoid nesting code too many levels deep.</p>
<p>For example, in the loop, it’s sometimes a good idea to use the <a href="info:while-for#continue"><code>continue</code></a> directive to avoid extra nesting.</p>
<p>For example, instead of adding a nested <code>if</code> conditional like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb137"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-1" title="1"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="kw">let</span> i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span><span class="op">;</span> i<span class="op">++</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> (cond) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-3" title="3">    ... <span class="co">// &lt;- one more nesting level</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-4" title="4">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can write:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb138"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-1" title="1"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="kw">let</span> i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span><span class="op">;</span> i<span class="op">++</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span>cond) <span class="op">*!*</span><span class="cf">continue</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-3" title="3"><span class="ss">  ...  // &lt;- no extra nesting level</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-4" title="4"><span class="ss">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A similar thing can be done with <code>if/else</code> and <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>For example, two constructs below are identical.</p>
<p>Option 1:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb139"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb139-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pow</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> n) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>The second one is more readable because the “special case” of <code>n &lt; 0</code> is handled early on. Once the check is done we can move on to the “main” code flow without the need for additional nesting.</p>
<h2 id="function-placement">Function Placement</h2>
<p>If you are writing several “helper” functions and the code that uses them, there are three ways to organize the functions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Declare the functions <em>above</em> the code that uses them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb141"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb141-1" title="1"><span class="co">// *!*function declarations*/!*</span></a>

<li><p>Mixed: a function is declared where it’s first used.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of time, the second variant is preferred.</p>
<p>That’s because when reading code, we first want to know <em>what it does</em>. If the code goes first, then it becomes clear from the start. Then, maybe we won’t need to read the functions at all, especially if their names are descriptive of what they actually do.</p>
<h2 id="style-guides">Style Guides</h2>
<p>A style guide contains general rules about “how to write” code, e.g. which quotes to use, how many spaces to indent, the maximal line length, etc. A lot of minor things.</p>
<p>When all members of a team use the same style guide, the code looks uniform, regardless of which team member wrote it.</p>
<p>Of course, a team can always write their own style guide, but usually there’s no need to. There are many existing guides to choose from.</p>
<p>Some popular choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">Google JavaScript Style Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js">Idiomatic.JS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://standardjs.com/">StandardJS</a></li>
<li>(plus many more)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a novice developer, start with the cheat sheet at the beginning of this chapter. Then you can browse other style guides to pick up more ideas and decide which one you like best.</p>
<h2 id="automated-linters">Automated Linters</h2>
<p>Linters are tools that can automatically check the style of your code and make improving suggestions.</p>
<p>The great thing about them is that style-checking can also find some bugs, like typos in variable or function names. Because of this feature, using a linter is recommended even if you don’t want to stick to one particular “code style”.</p>
<p>Here are some well-known linting tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> – one of the first linters.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a> – more settings than JSLint.</li>
<li><a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> – probably the newest one.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them can do the job. The author uses <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>.</p>
<p>Most linters are integrated with many popular editors: just enable the plugin in the editor and configure the style.</p>
<p>For instance, for ESLint you should do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</li>
<li>Install ESLint with the command <code>npm install -g eslint</code> (npm is a JavaScript package installer).</li>
<li>Create a config file named <code>.eslintrc</code> in the root of your JavaScript project (in the folder that contains all your files).</li>
<li>Install/enable the plugin for your editor that integrates with ESLint. The majority of editors have one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s an example of an <code>.eslintrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb143"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-1" title="1"><span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-12" title="12"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here the directive <code>"extends"</code> denotes that the configuration is based on the “eslint:recommended” set of settings. After that, we specify our own.</p>
<p>It is also possible to download style rule sets from the web and extend them instead. See <a href="http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started" class="uri">http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started</a> for more details about installation.</p>
<p>Also certain IDEs have built-in linting, which is convenient but not as customizable as ESLint.</p>
<h2 id="summary-18">Summary</h2>
<p>All syntax rules described in this chapter (and in the style guides referenced) aim to increase the readability of your code. All of them are debatable.</p>
<p>When we think about writing “better” code, the questions we should ask ourselves are: “What makes the code more readable and easier to understand?” and “What can help us avoid errors?” These are the main things to keep in mind when choosing and debating code styles.</p>
<p>Reading popular style guides will allow you to keep up to date with the latest ideas about code style trends and best practices.</p>
<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>
<p>As we know from the chapter <a href="info:structure" class="uri">info:structure</a>, comments can be single-line: starting with <code>//</code> and multiline: <code>/* ... */</code>.</p>
<p>We normally use them to describe how and why the code works.</p>
<p>At first sight, commenting might be obvious, but novices in programming often use them wrongly.</p>
<h2 id="bad-comments">Bad comments</h2>
<p>Novices tend to use comments to explain “what is going on in the code”. Like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb144"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-1" title="1"><span class="co">// This code will do this thing (...) and that thing (...)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-2" title="2"><span class="co">// ...and who knows what else...</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-3" title="3">very<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-4" title="4">complex<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-5" title="5">code<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>But in good code, the amount of such “explanatory” comments should be minimal. Seriously, the code should be easy to understand without them.</p>
<p>There’s a great rule about that: “if the code is so unclear that it requires a comment, then maybe it should be rewritten instead”.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-factor-out-functions">Recipe: factor out functions</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s beneficial to replace a code piece with a function, like here:</p>

<p>Now we can understand the code easily. The function itself becomes the comment. Such code is called <em>self-descriptive</em>.</p>
<h3 id="recipe-create-functions">Recipe: create functions</h3>
<p>And if we have a long “code sheet” like this:</p>

<p>Then it might be a better variant to refactor it into functions like:</p>

<p>Once again, functions themselves tell what’s going on. There’s nothing to comment. And also the code structure is better when split. It’s clear what every function does, what it takes and what it returns.</p>
<p>In reality, we can’t totally avoid “explanatory” comments. There are complex algorithms. And there are smart “tweaks” for purposes of optimization. But generally we should try to keep the code simple and self-descriptive.</p>
<h2 id="good-comments">Good comments</h2>
<p>So, explanatory comments are usually bad. Which comments are good?</p>
<dl>
<dt>Describe the architecture</dt>
<dd>Provide a high-level overview of components, how they interact, what’s the control flow in various situations… In short – the bird’s eye view of the code. There’s a special language <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> to build high-level architecture diagrams explaining the code. Definitely worth studying.
</dd>
<dt>Document function parameters and usage</dt>
<dd>There’s a special syntax <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc">JSDoc</a> to document a function: usage, parameters, returned value.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb149"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-1" title="1"><span class="co">/**</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-2" title="2"><span class="co"> * Returns x raised to the n-th power.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-3" title="3"><span class="co"> *</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-4" title="4"><span class="co"> * </span><span class="an">@param</span><span class="co"> </span><span class="cv">{number}</span><span class="co"> x The number to raise.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-5" title="5"><span class="co"> * </span><span class="an">@param</span><span class="co"> </span><span class="cv">{number}</span><span class="co"> n The power, must be a natural number.</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-10" title="10"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Such comments allow us to understand the purpose of the function and use it the right way without looking in its code.</p>
<p>By the way, many editors like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> can understand them as well and use them to provide autocomplete and some automatic code-checking.</p>
<p>Also, there are tools like <a href="https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc">JSDoc 3</a> that can generate HTML-documentation from the comments. You can read more information about JSDoc at <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/" class="uri">http://usejsdoc.org/</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Why is the task solved this way?</dt>
<dd><p>What’s written is important. But what’s <em>not</em> written may be even more important to understand what’s going on. Why is the task solved exactly this way? The code gives no answer.</p>
<p>If there are many ways to solve the task, why this one? Especially when it’s not the most obvious one.</p>
<p>Without such comments the following situation is possible: 1. You (or your colleague) open the code written some time ago, and see that it’s “suboptimal”. 2. You think: “How stupid I was then, and how much smarter I’m now”, and rewrite using the “more obvious and correct” variant. 3. …The urge to rewrite was good. But in the process you see that the “more obvious” solution is actually lacking. You even dimly remember why, because you already tried it long ago. You revert to the correct variant, but the time was wasted.</p>
<p>Comments that explain the solution are very important. They help to continue development the right way.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Any subtle features of the code? Where they are used?</dt>
<dd>If the code has anything subtle and counter-intuitive, it’s definitely worth commenting.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="summary-19">Summary</h2>
<p>An important sign of a good developer is comments: their presence and even their absence.</p>
<p>Good comments allow us to maintain the code well, come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Comment this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall architecture, high-level view.</li>
<li>Function usage.</li>
<li>Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid comments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.</li>
<li>Put them in only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn’t require them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments are also used for auto-documenting tools like JSDoc3: they read them and generate HTML-docs (or docs in another format).</p>
<h1 id="ninja-code">Ninja code</h1>
<p><code>quote author="Confucius (Analects)" Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.</code></p>
<p>Programmer ninjas of the past used these tricks to sharpen the mind of code maintainers.</p>
<p>Code review gurus look for them in test tasks.</p>
<p>Novice developers sometimes use them even better than programmer ninjas.</p>
<p>Read them carefully and find out who you are – a ninja, a novice, or maybe a code reviewer?</p>
<p><code>warn header="Irony detected" Many try to follow ninja paths. Few succeed.</code></p>
<h2 id="brevity-is-the-soul-of-wit">Brevity is the soul of wit</h2>
<p>Make the code as short as possible. Show how smart you are.</p>
<p>Let subtle language features guide you.</p>
<p>For instance, take a look at this ternary operator <code>'?'</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb150"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb150-1" title="1"><span class="co">// taken from a well-known javascript library</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb150-2" title="2">i <span class="op">=</span> i <span class="op">?</span> (i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">?</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">max</span>(<span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">,</span> len <span class="op">+</span> i) : i) : <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Cool, right? If you write like that, a developer who comes across this line and tries to understand what is the value of <code>i</code> is going to have a merry time. Then come to you, seeking for an answer.</p>
<p>Tell them that shorter is always better. Initiate them into the paths of ninja.</p>
<h2 id="one-letter-variables">One-letter variables</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Laozi (Tao Te Ching)" The Dao hides in wordlessness. Only the Dao is well begun and well completed.</code></p>
<p>Another way to code shorter is to use single-letter variable names everywhere. Like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>A short variable disappears in the code like a real ninja in the forest. No one will be able to find it using “search” of the editor. And even if someone does, they won’t be able to “decipher” what the name <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> means.</p>
<p>…But there’s an exception. A real ninja will never use <code>i</code> as the counter in a <code>"for"</code> loop. Anywhere, but not here. Look around, there are many more exotic letters. For instance, <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>An exotic variable as a loop counter is especially cool if the loop body takes 1-2 pages (make it longer if you can). Then if someone looks deep inside the loop, they won’t be able to quickly figure out that the variable named <code>x</code> is the loop counter.</p>
<h2 id="use-abbreviations">Use abbreviations</h2>
<p>If the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names – shorten them, make abbreviations.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>list</code> -&gt; <code>lst</code>.</li>
<li><code>userAgent</code> -&gt; <code>ua</code>.</li>
<li><code>browser</code> -&gt; <code>brsr</code>.</li>
<li>…etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the one with truly good intuition will be able to understand such names. Try to shorten everything. Only a worthy person should be able to uphold the development of your code.</p>
<h2 id="soar-high.-be-abstract.">Soar high. Be abstract.</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Laozi (Tao Te Ching)" The great square is cornerless&lt;br&gt; The great vessel is last complete,&lt;br&gt; The great note is rarified sound,&lt;br&gt; The great image has no form.</code></p>
<p>While choosing a name try to use the most abstract word. Like <code>obj</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>value</code>, <code>item</code>, <code>elem</code> and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The ideal name for a variable is <code>data</code>.</strong> Use it everywhere you can. Indeed, every variable holds <em>data</em>, right?</p>
<p>…But what to do if <code>data</code> is already taken? Try <code>value</code>, it’s also universal. After all, a variable eventually gets a <em>value</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name a variable by its type: <code>str</code>, <code>num</code>…</strong></p>
<p>Give them a try. A young initiate may wonder – are such names really useful for a ninja? Indeed, they are!</p>
<p>Sure, the variable name still means something. It says what’s inside the variable: a string, a number or something else. But when an outsider tries to understand the code, they’ll be surprised to see that there’s actually no information at all! And will ultimately fail to alter your well-thought code.</p>
<p>The value type is easy to find out by debugging. But what’s the meaning of the variable? Which string/number does it store?</p>
<p>There’s just no way to figure out without a good meditation!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>…But what if there are no more such names?</strong> Just add a number: <code>data1, item2, elem5</code>…</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attention-test">Attention test</h2>
<p>Only a truly attentive programmer should be able to understand your code. But how to check that?</p>
<p><strong>One of the ways – use similar variable names, like <code>date</code> and <code>data</code>.</strong></p>
<p>Mix them where you can.</p>
<p>A quick read of such code becomes impossible. And when there’s a typo… Ummm… We’re stuck for long, time to drink tea.</p>
<h2 id="smart-synonyms">Smart synonyms</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Laozi (Tao Te Ching)" The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.</code></p>
<p>Using <em>similar</em> names for <em>same</em> things makes life more interesting and shows your creativity to the public.</p>
<p>For instance, consider function prefixes. If a function shows a message on the screen – start it with <code>display…</code>, like <code>displayMessage</code>. And then if another function shows on the screen something else, like a user name, start it with <code>show…</code> (like <code>showName</code>).</p>
<p>Insinuate that there’s a subtle difference between such functions, while there is none.</p>
<p>Make a pact with fellow ninjas of the team: if John starts “showing” functions with <code>display...</code> in his code, then Peter could use <code>render..</code>, and Ann – <code>paint...</code>. Note how much more interesting and diverse the code became.</p>
<p>…And now the hat trick!</p>
<p>For two functions with important differences – use the same prefix!</p>
<p>For instance, the function <code>printPage(page)</code> will use a printer. And the function <code>printText(text)</code> will put the text on-screen. Let an unfamiliar reader think well over similarly named function <code>printMessage</code>: “Where does it put the message? To a printer or on the screen?”. To make it really shine, <code>printMessage(message)</code> should output it in the new window!</p>
<h2 id="reuse-names">Reuse names</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Laozi (Tao Te Ching)" Once the whole is divided, the parts&lt;br&gt; need names.&lt;br&gt; There are already enough names.&lt;br&gt; One must know when to stop.</code></p>
<p>Add a new variable only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, reuse existing names. Just write new values into them.</p>
<p>In a function try to use only variables passed as parameters.</p>
<p>That would make it really hard to identify what’s exactly in the variable <em>now</em>. And also where it comes from. The purpose is to develop the intuition and memory of a person reading the code. A person with weak intuition would have to analyze the code line-by-line and track the changes through every code branch.</p>
<p><strong>An advanced variant of the approach is to covertly (!) replace the value with something alike in the middle of a loop or a function.</strong></p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb151"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">ninjaFunction</span>(elem) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// 20 lines of code working with elem</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-4" title="4">  elem <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">clone</span>(elem)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-6" title="6">  <span class="co">// 20 more lines, now working with the clone of the elem!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A fellow programmer who wants to work with <code>elem</code> in the second half of the function will be surprised… Only during the debugging, after examining the code they will find out that they’re working with a clone!</p>
<p>Seen in code regularly. Deadly effective even against an experienced ninja.</p>
<h2 id="underscores-for-fun">Underscores for fun</h2>
<p>Put underscores <code>_</code> and <code>__</code> before variable names. Like <code>_name</code> or <code>__value</code>. It would be great if only you knew their meaning. Or, better, add them just for fun, without particular meaning at all. Or different meanings in different places.</p>
<p>You kill two rabbits with one shot. First, the code becomes longer and less readable, and the second, a fellow developer may spend a long time trying to figure out what the underscores mean.</p>
<p>A smart ninja puts underscores at one spot of code and evades them at other places. That makes the code even more fragile and increases the probability of future errors.</p>
<h2 id="show-your-love">Show your love</h2>
<p>Let everyone see how magnificent your entities are! Names like <code>superElement</code>, <code>megaFrame</code> and <code>niceItem</code> will definitely enlighten a reader.</p>
<p>Indeed, from one hand, something is written: <code>super..</code>, <code>mega..</code>, <code>nice..</code> But from the other hand – that brings no details. A reader may decide to look for a hidden meaning and meditate for an hour or two of their paid working time.</p>
<h2 id="overlap-outer-variables">Overlap outer variables</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Guan Yin Zi" When in the light, can't see anything in the darkness.&lt;br&gt; When in the darkness, can see everything in the light.</code></p>
<p>Use same names for variables inside and outside a function. As simple. No efforts to invent new names.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb152"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb152-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> <span class="op">*!*</span>user<span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span><span class="ss"> = authenticateUser</span><span class="sc">()</span><span class="ss">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb152-9" title="9">  ...</a>

<p>A programmer who jumps inside the <code>render</code> will probably fail to notice that there’s a local <code>user</code> shadowing the outer one.</p>
<p>Then they’ll try to work with <code>user</code> assuming that it’s the external variable, the result of <code>authenticateUser()</code>… The trap is sprung! Hello, debugger…</p>
<h2 id="side-effects-everywhere">Side-effects everywhere!</h2>
<p>There are functions that look like they don’t change anything. Like <code>isReady()</code>, <code>checkPermission()</code>, <code>findTags()</code>… They are assumed to carry out calculations, find and return the data, without changing anything outside of them. In other words, without “side-effects”.</p>
<p><strong>A really beautiful trick is to add a “useful” action to them, besides the main task.</strong></p>
<p>An expression of dazed surprise on the face of your colleague when they see a function named <code>is..</code>, <code>check..</code> or <code>find...</code> changing something – will definitely broaden your boundaries of reason.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to surprise is to return a non-standard result.</strong></p>
<p>Show your original thinking! Let the call of <code>checkPermission</code> return not <code>true/false</code>, but a complex object with the results of the check.</p>
<p>Those developers who try to write <code>if (checkPermission(..))</code>, will wonder why it doesn’t work. Tell them: “Read the docs!”. And give this article.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-functions">Powerful functions!</h2>
<p><code>quote author="Laozi (Tao Te Ching)" The great Tao flows everywhere,&lt;br&gt; both to the left and to the right.</code></p>
<p>Don’t limit the function by what’s written in its name. Be broader.</p>
<p>For instance, a function <code>validateEmail(email)</code> could (besides checking the email for correctness) show an error message and ask to re-enter the email.</p>
<p>Additional actions should not be obvious from the function name. A true ninja coder will make them not obvious from the code as well.</p>
<p><strong>Joining several actions into one protects your code from reuse.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine, another developer wants only to check the email, and not output any message. Your function <code>validateEmail(email)</code> that does both will not suit them. So they won’t break your meditation by asking anything about it.</p>
<h2 id="summary-20">Summary</h2>
<p>All “pieces of advice” above are from the real code… Sometimes, written by experienced developers. Maybe even more experienced than you are ;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow some of them, and your code will become full of surprises.</li>
<li>Follow many of them, and your code will become truly yours, no one would want to change it.</li>
<li>Follow all, and your code will become a valuable lesson for young developers looking for enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="automated-testing-with-mocha">Automated testing with Mocha</h1>
<p>Automated testing will be used in further tasks, and it’s also widely used in real projects.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-tests">Why do we need tests?</h2>
<p>When we write a function, we can usually imagine what it should do: which parameters give which results.</p>
<p>During development, we can check the function by running it and comparing the outcome with the expected one. For instance, we can do it in the console.</p>
<p>If something is wrong – then we fix the code, run again, check the result – and so on till it works.</p>
<p>But such manual “re-runs” are imperfect.</p>
<p><strong>When testing a code by manual re-runs, it’s easy to miss something.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, we’re creating a function <code>f</code>. Wrote some code, testing: <code>f(1)</code> works, but <code>f(2)</code> doesn’t work. We fix the code and now <code>f(2)</code> works. Looks complete? But we forgot to re-test <code>f(1)</code>. That may lead to an error.</p>
<p>That’s very typical. When we develop something, we keep a lot of possible use cases in mind. But it’s hard to expect a programmer to check all of them manually after every change. So it becomes easy to fix one thing and break another one.</p>
<p><strong>Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.</strong></p>
<h2 id="behavior-driven-development-bdd">Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a technique named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a> or, in short, BDD.</p>
<p><strong>BDD is three things in one: tests AND documentation AND examples.</strong></p>
<p>To understand BDD, we’ll examine a practical case of development.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-pow-the-spec">Development of “pow”: the spec</h2>
<p>Let’s say we want to make a function <code>pow(x, n)</code> that raises <code>x</code> to an integer power <code>n</code>. We assume that <code>n≥0</code>.</p>
<p>That task is just an example: there’s the <code>**</code> operator in JavaScript that can do that, but here we concentrate on the development flow that can be applied to more complex tasks as well.</p>
<p>Before creating the code of <code>pow</code>, we can imagine what the function should do and describe it.</p>
<p>Such description is called a <em>specification</em> or, in short, a spec, and contains descriptions of use cases together with tests for them, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb153"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-1" title="1"><span class="at">describe</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pow&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-2" title="2">  <span class="at">it</span>(<span class="st">&quot;raises to n-th power&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-3" title="3">    <span class="va">assert</span>.<span class="at">equal</span>(<span class="at">pow</span>(<span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">3</span>)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">8</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-4" title="4">  <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A spec has three main building blocks that you can see above:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>describe("title", function() { ... })</code></dt>
<dd>What functionality we’re describing. In our case we’re describing the function <code>pow</code>. Used to group “workers” – the <code>it</code> blocks.
</dd>
<dt><code>it("use case description", function() { ... })</code></dt>
<dd>In the title of <code>it</code> we <em>in a human-readable way</em> describe the particular use case, and the second argument is a function that tests it.
</dd>
<dt><code>assert.equal(value1, value2)</code></dt>
<dd><p>The code inside <code>it</code> block, if the implementation is correct, should execute without errors.</p>
<p>Functions <code>assert.*</code> are used to check whether <code>pow</code> works as expected. Right here we’re using one of them – <code>assert.equal</code>, it compares arguments and yields an error if they are not equal. Here it checks that the result of <code>pow(2, 3)</code> equals <code>8</code>. There are other types of comparisons and checks, that we’ll add later.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The specification can be executed, and it will run the test specified in <code>it</code> block. We’ll see that later.</p>
<h2 id="the-development-flow">The development flow</h2>
<p>The flow of development usually looks like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An initial spec is written, with tests for the most basic functionality.</li>
<li>An initial implementation is created.</li>
<li>To check whether it works, we run the testing framework <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> (more details soon) that runs the spec. While the functionality is not complete, errors are displayed. We make corrections until everything works.</li>
<li>Now we have a working initial implementation with tests.</li>
<li>We add more use cases to the spec, probably not yet supported by the implementations. Tests start to fail.</li>
<li>Go to 3, update the implementation till tests give no errors.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-6 till the functionality is ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the development is <em>iterative</em>. We write the spec, implement it, make sure tests pass, then write more tests, make sure they work etc. At the end we have both a working implementation and tests for it.</p>
<p>Let’s see this development flow in our practical case.</p>
<p>The first step is already complete: we have an initial spec for <code>pow</code>. Now, before making the implementation, let’s use few JavaScript libraries to run the tests, just to see that they are working (they will all fail).</p>
<h2 id="the-spec-in-action">The spec in action</h2>
<p>Here in the tutorial we’ll be using the following JavaScript libraries for tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> – the core framework: it provides common testing functions including <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> and the main function that runs tests.</li>
<li><a href="http://chaijs.com">Chai</a> – the library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions, for now we need only <code>assert.equal</code>.</li>
<li><a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> – a library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we’ll need it much later.</li>
</ul>
<p>These libraries are suitable for both in-browser and server-side testing. Here we’ll consider the browser variant.</p>
<p>The full HTML page with these frameworks and <code>pow</code> spec:</p>
<p>```html src=“index.html”</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>The page can be divided into five parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> – add third-party libraries and styles for tests.</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> with the function to test, in our case – with the code for <code>pow</code>.</li>
<li>The tests – in our case an external script <code>test.js</code> that has <code>describe("pow", ...)</code> from above.</li>
<li>The HTML element <code>&lt;div id="mocha"&gt;</code> will be used by Mocha to output results.</li>
<li>The tests are started by the command <code>mocha.run()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result:</p>
<p>[iframe height=250 src=“pow-1” border=1 edit]</p>
<p>As of now, the test fails, there’s an error. That’s logical: we have an empty function code in <code>pow</code>, so <code>pow(2,3)</code> returns <code>undefined</code> instead of <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>For the future, let’s note that there are more high-level test-runners, like <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/">karma</a> and others, that make it easy to autorun many different tests.</p>
<h2 id="initial-implementation">Initial implementation</h2>
<p>Let’s make a simple implementation of <code>pow</code>, for tests to pass:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb154"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb154-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pow</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> n) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb154-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">8</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// :) we cheat!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb154-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Wow, now it works!</p>
<p>[iframe height=250 src=“pow-min” border=1 edit]</p>
<h2 id="improving-the-spec">Improving the spec</h2>
<p>What we’ve done is definitely a cheat. The function does not work: an attempt to calculate <code>pow(3,4)</code> would give an incorrect result, but tests pass.</p>
<p>…But the situation is quite typical, it happens in practice. Tests pass, but the function works wrong. Our spec is imperfect. We need to add more use cases to it.</p>
<p>Let’s add one more test to check that <code>pow(3, 4) = 81</code>.</p>
<p>We can select one of two ways to organize the test here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first variant – add one more <code>assert</code> into the same <code>it</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb155"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb155-1" title="1"><span class="at">describe</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pow&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb155-5" title="5"><span class="op">*!*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb155-6" title="6">    <span class="va">assert</span>.<span class="at">equal</span>(<span class="at">pow</span>(<span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">4</span>)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">81</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb155-9" title="9"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb155-10" title="10"><span class="ss">}</span><span class="sc">)</span><span class="ss">;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>The second – make two tests:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb156"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-1" title="1"><span class="at">describe</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pow&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-2" title="2">  <span class="at">it</span>(<span class="st">&quot;2 raised to power 3 is 8&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-3" title="3">    <span class="va">assert</span>.<span class="at">equal</span>(<span class="at">pow</span>(<span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">3</span>)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">8</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-4" title="4">  <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-6" title="6">  <span class="at">it</span>(<span class="st">&quot;3 raised to power 4 is 81&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-7" title="7">    <span class="va">assert</span>.<span class="at">equal</span>(<span class="at">pow</span>(<span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">4</span>)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">81</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-8" title="8">  <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-9" title="9"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>The principal difference is that when <code>assert</code> triggers an error, the <code>it</code> block immediately terminates. So, in the first variant if the first <code>assert</code> fails, then we’ll never see the result of the second <code>assert</code>.</p>
<p>Making tests separate is useful to get more information about what’s going on, so the second variant is better.</p>
<p>And besides that, there’s one more rule that’s good to follow.</p>
<p><strong>One test checks one thing.</strong></p>
<p>If we look at the test and see two independent checks in it, it’s better to split it into two simpler ones.</p>
<p>So let’s continue with the second variant.</p>
<p>The result:</p>
<p>[iframe height=250 src=“pow-2” edit border=“1”]</p>
<p>As we could expect, the second test failed. Sure, our function always returns <code>8</code>, while the <code>assert</code> expects <code>81</code>.</p>
<h2 id="improving-the-implementation">Improving the implementation</h2>
<p>Let’s write something more real for tests to pass:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb157"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pow</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> n) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-4" title="4">  <span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="kw">let</span> i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> n<span class="op">;</span> i<span class="op">++</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-5" title="5">    result <span class="op">*=</span> x<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-6" title="6">  <span class="op">}</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-9" title="9"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>To be sure that the function works well, let’s test it for more values. Instead of writing <code>it</code> blocks manually, we can generate them in <code>for</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb158"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-1" title="1"><span class="at">describe</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pow&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span> () <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>We’re going to add even more tests. But before that let’s note that the helper function <code>makeTest</code> and <code>for</code> should be grouped together.

<p>```<code>smart header="</code>before/after<code>and</code>beforeEach/afterEach<code>" We can setup</code>before/after<code>functions that execute before/after running tests, and also</code>beforeEach/afterEach<code>functions that execute before/after *every*</code>it`.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js no-beautify describe(“test”, function () { before(() =&gt; alert(“Testing started – before all tests”)); after(() =&gt; alert(“Testing finished – after all tests”));</p>
<p>beforeEach(() =&gt; alert(“Before a test – enter a test”)); afterEach(() =&gt; alert(“After a test – exit a test”));</p>
<p>it(“test 1”, () =&gt; alert(1)); it(“test 2”, () =&gt; alert(2)); });</p>
<pre><code>
The running sequence will be:
</code></pre>
<p>Testing started – before all tests (before) Before a test – enter a test (beforeEach) 1 After a test – exit a test (afterEach) Before a test – enter a test (beforeEach) 2 After a test – exit a test (afterEach) Testing finished – after all tests (after)</p>
<pre><code>
[edit src=&quot;beforeafter&quot; title=&quot;Open the example in the sandbox.&quot;]

Usually, `beforeEach/afterEach` and `before/after` are used to perform initialization, zero out counters or do something else between the tests (or test groups).

<h2 id="extending-the-spec">Extending the spec</h2>
<p>The basic functionality of <code>pow</code> is complete. The first iteration of the development is done. When we’re done celebrating and drinking champagne – let’s go on and improve it.</p>
<p>As it was said, the function <code>pow(x, n)</code> is meant to work with positive integer values <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>To indicate a mathematical error, JavaScript functions usually return <code>NaN</code>. Let’s do the same for invalid values of <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s first add the behavior to the spec(!):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb162"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-1" title="1"><span class="at">describe</span>(<span class="st">&quot;pow&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-17" title="17"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The result with new tests:</p>
<p>[iframe height=530 src=“pow-nan” edit border=“1”]</p>
<p>The newly added tests fail, because our implementation does not support them. That’s how BDD is done: first we write failing tests, and then make an implementation for them.</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Other assertions" Please note the assertion</code>assert.isNaN<code>: it checks for</code>NaN`.</p>
<p>There are other assertions in <a href="http://chaijs.com">Chai</a> as well, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assert.equal(value1, value2)</code> – checks the equality <code>value1 == value2</code>.</li>
<li><code>assert.strictEqual(value1, value2)</code> – checks the strict equality <code>value1 === value2</code>.</li>
<li><code>assert.notEqual</code>, <code>assert.notStrictEqual</code> – inverse checks to the ones above.</li>
<li><code>assert.isTrue(value)</code> – checks that <code>value === true</code></li>
<li><code>assert.isFalse(value)</code> – checks that <code>value === false</code></li>
<li>…the full list is in the <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/assert/">docs</a> ```</li>
</ul>
<p>So we should add a couple of lines to <code>pow</code>:</p>

<p>[iframe height=300 src=“pow-full” edit border=“1”]</p>
<p>[edit src=“pow-full” title=“Open the full final example in the sandbox.”]</p>
<h2 id="summary-21">Summary</h2>
<p>In BDD, the spec goes first, followed by implementation. At the end we have both the spec and the code.</p>
<p>The spec can be used in three ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As <strong>Tests</strong> - they guarantee that the code works correctly.</li>
<li>As <strong>Docs</strong> – the titles of <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> tell what the function does.</li>
<li>As <strong>Examples</strong> – the tests are actually working examples showing how a function can be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the spec, we can safely improve, change, even rewrite the function from scratch and make sure it still works right.</p>
<p>That’s especially important in large projects when a function is used in many places. When we change such a function, there’s just no way to manually check if every place that uses it still works right.</p>
<p>Without tests, people have two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To perform the change, no matter what. And then our users meet bugs, as we probably fail to check something manually.</li>
<li>Or, if the punishment for errors is harsh, as there are no tests, people become afraid to modify such functions, and then the code becomes outdated, no one wants to get into it. Not good for development.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Automatic testing helps to avoid these problems!</strong></p>
<p>If the project is covered with tests, there’s just no such problem. After any changes, we can run tests and see a lot of checks made in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Besides, a well-tested code has better architecture.</strong></p>
<p>Naturally, that’s because auto-tested code is easier to modify and improve. But there’s also another reason.</p>
<p>To write tests, the code should be organized in such a way that every function has a clearly described task, well-defined input and output. That means a good architecture from the beginning.</p>
<p>In real life that’s sometimes not that easy. Sometimes it’s difficult to write a spec before the actual code, because it’s not yet clear how it should behave. But in general writing tests makes development faster and more stable.</p>
<p>Later in the tutorial you will meet many tasks with tests baked-in. So you’ll see more practical examples.</p>
<p>Writing tests requires good JavaScript knowledge. But we’re just starting to learn it. So, to settle down everything, as of now you’re not required to write tests, but you should already be able to read them even if they are a little bit more complex than in this chapter.</p>
<h1 id="polyfills-and-transpilers">Polyfills and transpilers</h1>
<p>The JavaScript language steadily evolves. New proposals to the language appear regularly, they are analyzed and, if considered worthy, are appended to the list at <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/" class="uri">https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/</a> and then progress to the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">specification</a>.</p>
<p>Teams behind JavaScript engines have their own ideas about what to implement first. They may decide to implement proposals that are in draft and postpone things that are already in the spec, because they are less interesting or just harder to do.</p>
<p>So it’s quite common for an engine to implement only the part of the standard.</p>
<p>A good page to see the current state of support for language features is <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" class="uri">https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a> (it’s big, we have a lot to study yet).</p>
<p>As programmers, we’d like to use most recent features. The more good stuff - the better!</p>
<p>On the other hand, how to make our modern code work on older engines that don’t understand recent features yet?</p>
<p>There are two tools for that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transpilers.</li>
<li>Polyfills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, in this chapter, our purpose is to get the gist of how they work, and their place in web development.</p>
<h2 id="transpilers">Transpilers</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler">transpiler</a> is a special piece of software that can parse (“read and understand”) modern code, and rewrite it using older syntax constructs, so that the result would be the same.</p>
<p>E.g. JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” <code>??</code>. So, if a visitor uses an outdated browser, it may fail to understand the code like <code>height = height ?? 100</code>.</p>
<p>A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite <code>height ?? 100</code> into <code>(height !== undefined &amp;&amp; height !== null) ? height : 100</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb164"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-1" title="1"><span class="co">// before running the transpiler</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-2" title="2">height <span class="op">=</span> height <span class="op">??</span> <span class="dv">100</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-4" title="4"><span class="co">// after running the transpiler</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-5" title="5">height <span class="op">=</span> (height <span class="op">!==</span> <span class="kw">undefined</span> <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> height <span class="op">!==</span> <span class="kw">null</span>) <span class="op">?</span> height : <span class="dv">100</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now the rewritten code is suitable for older JavaScript engines.</p>
<p>Usually, a developer runs the transpiler on their own computer, and then deploys the transpiled code to the server.</p>
<p>Speaking of names, <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a> is one of the most prominent transpilers out there.</p>
<p>Modern project build systems, such as <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>, provide means to run transpiler automatically on every code change, so it’s very easy to integrate into development process.</p>
<h2 id="polyfills">Polyfills</h2>
<p>New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions.</p>
<p>For example, <code>Math.trunc(n)</code> is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g <code>Math.trunc(1.23)</code> returns <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no <code>Math.trunc</code>, so such code will fail.</p>
<p>As we’re talking about new functions, not syntax changes, there’s no need to transpile anything here. We just need to declare the missing function.</p>
<p>A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.</p>
<p>For this particular case, the polyfill for <code>Math.trunc</code> is a script that implements it, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb165"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-1" title="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span><span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">trunc</span>) <span class="op">{</span> <span class="co">// if no such function</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// implement it</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-3" title="3">  <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">trunc</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(number) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-4" title="4">    <span class="co">// Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-5" title="5">    <span class="co">// they are covered later in the tutorial</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-6" title="6">    <span class="cf">return</span> number <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">?</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">ceil</span>(number) : <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">floor</span>(number)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-7" title="7">  <span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-8" title="8"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>JavaScript is a highly dynamic language, scripts may add/modify any functions, even including built-in ones.</p>
<p>Two interesting libraries of polyfills are: - <a href="https://github.com/zloirock/core-js">core js</a> that supports a lot, allows to include only needed features. - <a href="http://polyfill.io">polyfill.io</a> service that provides a script with polyfills, depending on the features and user’s browser.</p>
<h2 id="summary-22">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter we’d like to motivate you to study modern and even “bleeding-edge” language features, even if they aren’t yet well-supported by JavaScript engines.</p>
<p>Just don’t forget to use transpiler (if using modern syntax or operators) and polyfills (to add functions that may be missing). And they’ll ensure that the code works.</p>
<p>For example, later when you’re familiar with JavaScript, you can setup a code build system based on <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> with <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel-loader">babel-loader</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Good resources that show the current state of support for various features: - <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" class="uri">https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a> - for pure JavaScript. - <a href="https://caniuse.com/" class="uri">https://caniuse.com/</a> - for browser-related functions.</p>
<p>P.S. Google Chrome is usually the most up-to-date with language features, try it if a tutorial demo fails. Most tutorial demos work with any modern browser though.</p>
<h1 id="objects">Objects</h1>
<p>As we know from the chapter <a href="info:types" class="uri">info:types</a>, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).</p>
<p>In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.</p>
<p>An object can be created with figure brackets <code>{…}</code> with an optional list of <em>properties</em>. A property is a “key: value” pair, where <code>key</code> is a string (also called a “property name”), and <code>value</code> can be anything.</p>
<p>We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.</p>
<p><img src="object.svg" /></p>
<p>An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb166"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="at">Object</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &quot;object constructor&quot; syntax</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{};</span>  <span class="co">// &quot;object literal&quot; syntax</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="object-user-empty.svg" /></p>
<p>Usually, the figure brackets <code>{...}</code> are used. That declaration is called an <em>object literal</em>.</p>
<h2 id="literals-and-properties">Literals and properties</h2>
<p>We can immediately put some properties into <code>{...}</code> as “key: value” pairs:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb167"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb167-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span>     <span class="co">// an object</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb167-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">name</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>  <span class="co">// by key &quot;name&quot; store value &quot;John&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb167-3" title="3">  <span class="dt">age</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">30</span>        <span class="co">// by key &quot;age&quot; store value 30</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb167-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon <code>":"</code> and a value to the right of it.</p>
<p>In the <code>user</code> object, there are two properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first property has the name <code>"name"</code> and the value <code>"John"</code>.</li>
<li>The second one has the name <code>"age"</code> and the value <code>30</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting <code>user</code> object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="object-user.svg" alt="user object" /><figcaption>user object</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can add, remove and read files from it any time.</p>
<p>Property values are accessible using the dot notation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb168"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb168-1" title="1"><span class="co">// get property values of the object:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb168-2" title="2"><span class="at">alert</span>( <span class="va">user</span>.<span class="at">name</span> )<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// John</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb168-3" title="3"><span class="at">alert</span>( <span class="va">user</span>.<span class="at">age</span> )<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 30</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb169"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb169-1" title="1"><span class="va">user</span>.<span class="at">isAdmin</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">true</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<figure>
<img src="object-user-isadmin.svg" alt="user object 2" /><figcaption>user object 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To remove a property, we can use <code>delete</code> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb170"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb170-1" title="1"><span class="kw">delete</span> <span class="va">user</span>.<span class="at">age</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<figure>
<img src="object-user-delete.svg" alt="user object 3" /><figcaption>user object 3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb171"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">name</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-3" title="3">  <span class="dt">age</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">30</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-4" title="4">  <span class="st">&quot;likes birds&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">true</span>  <span class="co">// multiword property name must be quoted</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-5" title="5"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="object-user-props.svg" /></p>
<p>The last property in the list may end with a comma:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb172"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">name</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-3" title="3">  <span class="dt">age</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">30</span><span class="op">*!*,*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-4" title="4"><span class="ss">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.</p>
<h2 id="square-brackets">Square brackets</h2>
<p>For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:</p>
<p><code>js run // this would give a syntax error user.likes birds = true</code></p>
<p>JavaScript doesn’t understand that. It thinks that we address <code>user.likes</code>, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected <code>birds</code>.</p>
<p>The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters (<code>$</code> and <code>_</code> are allowed).</p>
<p>There’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:</p>
<p>```js run let user = {};</p>
<p>// set user[“likes birds”] = true;</p>
<p>// get alert(user[“likes birds”]); // true</p>
<p>// delete delete user[“likes birds”]; ```</p>
<p>Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).</p>
<p>Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb173"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> key <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;likes birds&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-3" title="3"><span class="co">// same as user[&quot;likes birds&quot;] = true;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-4" title="4">user[key] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">true</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the variable <code>key</code> may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, age: 30 };</p>
<p>let key = prompt(“What do you want to know about the user?”, “name”);</p>
<p>// access by variable alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter “name”) ```</p>
<p>The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, age: 30 };</p>
<p>let key = “name”; alert( user.key ) // undefined ```</p>
<h3 id="computed-properties">Computed properties</h3>
<p>We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called <em>computed properties</em>.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let fruit = prompt(“Which fruit to buy?”, “apple”);</p>
<p>let bag = { <em>!</em> [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit <em>/!</em> };</p>
<p>alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit=“apple” ```</p>
<p>The meaning of a computed property is simple: <code>[fruit]</code> means that the property name should be taken from <code>fruit</code>.</p>
<p>So, if a visitor enters <code>"apple"</code>, <code>bag</code> will become <code>{apple: 5}</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially, that works the same as: ```js run let fruit = prompt(“Which fruit to buy?”, “apple”); let bag = {};</p>
<p>// take property name from the fruit variable bag[fruit] = 5; ```</p>
<p>…But looks nicer.</p>
<p>We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb174"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> fruit <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;apple&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> bag <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-3" title="3">  [fruit <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&#39;Computers&#39;</span>]<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="co">// bag.appleComputers = 5</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Square brackets are much more powerful than the dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.</p>
<p>So most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.</p>
<h2 id="property-value-shorthand">Property value shorthand</h2>
<p>In real code we often use existing variables as values for property names.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run function makeUser(name, age) { return { name: name, age: age, // …other properties }; }</p>
<p>let user = makeUser(“John”, 30); alert(user.name); // John ```</p>
<p>In the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there’s a special <em>property value shorthand</em> to make it shorter.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>name:name</code> we can just write <code>name</code>, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb175"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">makeUser</span>(name<span class="op">,</span> age) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-2" title="2"><span class="op">*!*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-3" title="3">  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-4" title="4">    name<span class="op">,</span> <span class="co">// same as name: name</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-5" title="5">    age<span class="op">,</span>  <span class="co">// same as age: age</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-6" title="6">    <span class="co">// ...</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-7" title="7">  <span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-8" title="8"><span class="op">*</span><span class="ss">/!</span><span class="sc">*</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-9" title="9"><span class="ss">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb176"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> user <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-2" title="2">  name<span class="op">,</span>  <span class="co">// same as name:name</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-3" title="3">  <span class="dt">age</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">30</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="property-names-limitations">Property names limitations</h2>
<p>As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.</p>
<p>But for an object property, there’s no such restriction:</p>
<p>```js run // these properties are all right let obj = { for: 1, let: 2, return: 3 };</p>
<p>alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return ); // 6 ```</p>
<p>In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).</p>
<p>Other types are automatically converted to strings.</p>
<p>For instance, a number <code>0</code> becomes a string <code>"0"</code> when used as a property key:</p>
<p>```js run let obj = { 0: “test” // same as “0”: “test” };</p>
<p>// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string “0”) alert( obj[“0”] ); // test alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property) ```</p>
<p>There’s a minor gotcha with a special property named <code>__proto__</code>. We can’t set it to a non-object value:</p>
<p><code>js run let obj = {}; obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended</code></p>
<p>As we see from the code, the assignment to a primitive <code>5</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>We’ll cover the special nature of <code>__proto__</code> in <a href="info:prototype-inheritance">subsequent chapters</a>, and suggest the <a href="info:prototype-methods">ways to fix</a> such behavior.</p>
<h2 id="property-existence-test-in-operator">Property existence test, “in” operator</h2>
<p>A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!</p>
<p>Reading a non-existing property just returns <code>undefined</code>. So we can easily test whether the property exists:</p>
<p>```js run let user = {};</p>
<p>alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means “no such property” ```</p>
<p>There’s also a special operator <code>"in"</code> for that.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb177"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-1" title="1"><span class="st">&quot;key&quot;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> object</a></code></pre></div>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, age: 30 };</p>
<p>alert( “age” in user ); // true, user.age exists alert( “blabla” in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn’t exist ```</p>
<p>Please note that on the left side of <code>in</code> there must be a <em>property name</em>. That’s usually a quoted string.</p>
<p>If we omit quotes, that means a variable, it should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { age: 30 };</p>
<p>let key = “age”; alert( <em>!</em>key<em>/!</em> in user ); // true, property “age” exists ```</p>
<p>Why does the <code>in</code> operator exist? Isn’t it enough to compare against <code>undefined</code>?</p>
<p>Well, most of the time the comparison with <code>undefined</code> works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but <code>"in"</code> works correctly.</p>
<p>It’s when an object property exists, but stores <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let obj = { test: undefined };</p>
<p>alert( obj.test ); // it’s undefined, so - no such property?</p>
<p>alert( “test” in obj ); // true, the property does exist! ```</p>
<p>In the code above, the property <code>obj.test</code> technically exists. So the <code>in</code> operator works right.</p>
<p>Situations like this happen very rarely, because <code>undefined</code> should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use <code>null</code> for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the <code>in</code> operator is an exotic guest in the code.</p>
<h2 id="the-for..in-loop">The “for..in” loop</h2>
<p>To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: <code>for..in</code>. This is a completely different thing from the <code>for(;;)</code> construct that we studied before.</p>
<p>The syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb178"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb178-1" title="1"><span class="cf">for</span> (key <span class="kw">in</span> object) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb178-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// executes the body for each key among object properties</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb178-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>For instance, let’s output all properties of <code>user</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, age: 30, isAdmin: true };</p>
<p>for (let key in user) { // keys alert( key ); // name, age, isAdmin // values for the keys alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true } ```</p>
<p>Note that all “for” constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like <code>let key</code> here.</p>
<p>Also, we could use another variable name here instead of <code>key</code>. For instance, <code>"for (let prop in obj)"</code> is also widely used.</p>
<h3 id="ordered-like-an-object">Ordered like an object</h3>
<p>Are objects ordered? In other words, if we loop over an object, do we get all properties in the same order they were added? Can we rely on this?</p>
<p>The short answer is: “ordered in a special fashion”: integer properties are sorted, others appear in creation order. The details follow.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s consider an object with the phone codes:</p>
<p>```js run let codes = { “49”: “Germany”, “41”: “Switzerland”, “44”: “Great Britain”, // .., “1”: “USA” };</p>
<p><em>!</em> for (let code in codes) { alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49 } <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>The object may be used to suggest a list of options to the user. If we’re making a site mainly for German audience then we probably want <code>49</code> to be the first.</p>
<p>But if we run the code, we see a totally different picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA (1) goes first</li>
<li>then Switzerland (41) and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phone codes go in the ascending sorted order, because they are integers. So we see <code>1, 41, 44, 49</code>.</p>
<p>````smart header=“Integer properties? What’s that?” The “integer property” term here means a string that can be converted to-and-from an integer without a change.</p>
<p>So, “49” is an integer property name, because when it’s transformed to an integer number and back, it’s still the same. But “+49” and “1.2” are not:</p>
<p><code>js run // Math.trunc is a built-in function that removes the decimal part alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("49"))) ); // "49", same, integer property alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("+49"))) ); // "49", not same "+49" ⇒ not integer property alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("1.2"))) ); // "1", not same "1.2" ⇒ not integer property</code></p>
<pre><code>
...On the other hand, if the keys are non-integer, then they are listed in the creation order, for instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  surname: &quot;Smith&quot;
};
user.age = 25; // add one more

*!*
// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order
*/!*
for (let prop in user) {
  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age
}
```

So, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can &quot;cheat&quot; by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus `&quot;+&quot;` sign before each code is enough.

Like this:

```js run
let codes = {
  &quot;+49&quot;: &quot;Germany&quot;,
  &quot;+41&quot;: &quot;Switzerland&quot;,
  &quot;+44&quot;: &quot;Great Britain&quot;,
  // ..,
  &quot;+1&quot;: &quot;USA&quot;,
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(+code); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
```

Now it works as intended.

## Summary

Objects are associative arrays with several special features.

They store properties (key-value pairs), where:

- Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
- Values can be of any type.

To access a property, we can use:

- The dot notation: `obj.property`.
- Square brackets notation `obj[&quot;property&quot;]`. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like `obj[varWithKey]`.

Additional operators:

- To delete a property: `delete obj.prop`.
- To check if a property with the given key exists: `&quot;key&quot; in obj`.
- To iterate over an object: `for (let key in obj)` loop.

What we&#39;ve studied in this chapter is called a &quot;plain object&quot;, or just `Object`.

There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:

- `Array` to store ordered data collections,
- `Date` to store the information about the date and time,
- `Error` to store the information about an error.
- ...And so on.

They have their special features that we&#39;ll study later. Sometimes people say something like &quot;Array type&quot; or &quot;Date type&quot;, but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single &quot;object&quot; data type. And they extend it in various ways.

Objects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we&#39;ve just scratched the surface of a topic that is really huge. We&#39;ll be closely working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the tutorial.

# Code editors

A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.

There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

## IDE

The term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a &quot;whole project.&quot; As the name suggests, it&#39;s not just an editor, but a full-scale &quot;development environment.&quot;

An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)), a testing environment, and other &quot;project-level&quot; stuff.

If you haven&#39;t selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (cross-platform, paid).

For Windows, there&#39;s also &quot;Visual Studio&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Visual Studio Code&quot;. &quot;Visual Studio&quot; is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. It&#39;s also good at JavaScript. There&#39;s also a free version [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer&#39;s salary, so just choose the best one for you.

## Lightweight editors

&quot;Lightweight editors&quot; are not as powerful as IDEs, but they&#39;re fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a &quot;lightweight editor&quot; and an &quot;IDE&quot; is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there&#39;s no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.

The following options deserve your attention:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

## Let&#39;s not argue

The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.

There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.

# Object references and copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied &quot;by reference&quot;, whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc -- are always copied &quot;as a whole value&quot;.

That&#39;s easy to understand if we look a bit under the hood of what happens when we copy a value.

Let&#39;s start with a primitive, such as a string.

Here we put a copy of `message` into `phrase`:

```js
let message = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
let phrase = message;
```

As a result we have two independent variables, each one storing the string `&quot;Hello!&quot;`.

![](variable-copy-value.svg)

Quite an obvious result, right?

Objects are not like that.

**A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its &quot;address in memory&quot; -- in other words &quot;a reference&quot; to it.**

Let&#39;s look at an example of such a variable:

```js
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
};
```

And here&#39;s how it&#39;s actually stored in memory:

![](variable-contains-reference.svg)

The object is stored somewhere in memory (at the right of the picture), while the `user` variable (at the left) has a &quot;reference&quot; to it.

We may think of an object variable, such as `user`, as like a sheet of paper with the address of the object on it.

When we perform actions with the object, e.g. take a property `user.name`, the JavaScript engine looks at what&#39;s at that address and performs the operation on the actual object.

Now here&#39;s why it&#39;s important.

**When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.**

For instance:

```js no-beautify
let user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };

let admin = user; // copy the reference
```

Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object:

![](variable-copy-reference.svg)

As you can see, there&#39;s still one object, but now with two variables that reference it.

We can use either variable to access the object and modify its contents:

```js run
let user = { name: &#39;John&#39; };

let admin = user;

*!*
admin.name = &#39;Pete&#39;; // changed by the &quot;admin&quot; reference
*/!*

alert(*!*user.name*/!*); // &#39;Pete&#39;, changes are seen from the &quot;user&quot; reference
```

It&#39;s as if we had a cabinet with two keys and used one of them (`admin`) to get into it and make changes. Then, if we later use another key (`user`), we are still opening the same cabinet and can access the changed contents.

## Comparison by reference

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

For instance, here `a` and `b` reference the same object, thus they are equal:

```js run
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert(a == b); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert(a === b); // true
```

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):

```js run
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert(a == b); // false
```

For comparisons like `obj1 &gt; obj2` or for a comparison against a primitive `obj == 5`, objects are converted to primitives. We&#39;ll study how object conversions work very soon, but to tell the truth, such comparisons are needed very rarely -- usually they appear as a result of a programming mistake.

## Cloning and merging, Object.assign [#cloning-and-merging-object-assign]

So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

But what if we need to duplicate an object? Create an independent copy, a clone?

That&#39;s also doable, but a little bit more difficult, because there&#39;s no built-in method for that in JavaScript. But there is rarely a need -- copying by reference is good most of the time.

But if we really want that, then we need to create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let&#39;s copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}
*/!*

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content
clone.name = &quot;Pete&quot;; // changed the data in it

alert( user.name ); // still John in the original object
```

Also we can use the method [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) for that.

The syntax is:

```js
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
```

- The first argument `dest` is a target object.
- Further arguments `src1, ..., srcN` (can be as many as needed) are source objects.
- It copies the properties of all source objects `src1, ..., srcN` into the target `dest`. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.
- The call returns `dest`.

For instance, we can use it to merge several objects into one:

```js
let user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };

let permissions1 = { canView: true };
let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };

*!*
// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);
*/!*

// now user = { name: &quot;John&quot;, canView: true, canEdit: true }
```

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

```js run
let user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };

Object.assign(user, { name: &quot;Pete&quot; });

alert(user.name); // now user = { name: &quot;Pete&quot; }
```

We also can use `Object.assign` to replace `for..in` loop for simple cloning:

```js
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
*/!*
```

It copies all properties of `user` into the empty object and returns it.

There are also other methods of cloning an object, e.g. using the [spread syntax](info:rest-parameters-spread) `clone = {...user}`, covered later in the tutorial.

## Nested cloning

Until now we assumed that all properties of `user` are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. What to do with them?

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50,
  },
};

alert(user.sizes.height); // 182
```

Now it&#39;s not enough to copy `clone.sizes = user.sizes`, because the `user.sizes` is an object, it will be copied by reference. So `clone` and `user` will share the same sizes:

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50,
  },
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert(user.sizes === clone.sizes); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width++; // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one
```

To fix that, we should use a cloning loop that examines each value of `user[key]` and, if it&#39;s an object, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a &quot;deep cloning&quot;.

We can use recursion to implement it. Or, to not reinvent the wheel, take an existing implementation, for instance [\_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep) from the JavaScript library [lodash](https://lodash.com).

````smart header=&quot;Const objects can be modified&quot;
An important side effect of storing objects as references is that an object declared as `const` *can* be modified.

For instance:

```js run
const user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;
};

*!*
user.name = &quot;Pete&quot;; // (*)
*/!*

alert(user.name); // Pete
```

It might seem that the line `(*)` would cause an error, but it does not. The value of `user` is constant, it must always reference the same object, but properties of that object are free to change.

In other words, the `const user` gives an error only if we try to set `user=...` as a whole.

That said, if we really need to make constant object properties, it&#39;s also possible, but using totally different methods. We&#39;ll mention that in the chapter &lt;info:property-descriptors&gt;.
````

## Summary

Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the &quot;object value&quot;, but a &quot;reference&quot; (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object itself.

All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.

To make a &quot;real copy&quot; (a clone) we can use `Object.assign` for the so-called &quot;shallow copy&quot; (nested objects are copied by reference) or a &quot;deep cloning&quot; function, such as [\_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep).

# Garbage collection

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions... All that takes memory.

What happens when something is not needed any more? How does the JavaScript engine discover it and clean it up?

## Reachability

The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is _reachability_.

Simply put, &quot;reachable&quot; values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

1. There&#39;s a base set of inherently reachable values, that cannot be deleted for obvious reasons.

   For instance:

   - The currently executing function, its local variables and parameters.
   - Other functions on the current chain of nested calls, their local variables and parameters.
   - Global variables.
   - (there are some other, internal ones as well)

   These values are called _roots_.

2. Any other value is considered reachable if it&#39;s reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.

   For instance, if there&#39;s an object in a global variable, and that object has a property referencing another object, _that_ object is considered reachable. And those that it references are also reachable. Detailed examples to follow.

There&#39;s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called [garbage collector](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)&gt;). It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.

## A simple example

Here&#39;s the simplest example:

```js
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
};
```

![](memory-user-john.svg)

Here the arrow depicts an object reference. The global variable `&quot;user&quot;` references the object `{name: &quot;John&quot;}` (we&#39;ll call it John for brevity). The `&quot;name&quot;` property of John stores a primitive, so it&#39;s painted inside the object.

If the value of `user` is overwritten, the reference is lost:

```js
user = null;
```

![](memory-user-john-lost.svg)

Now John becomes unreachable. There&#39;s no way to access it, no references to it. Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory.

## Two references

Now let&#39;s imagine we copied the reference from `user` to `admin`:

```js
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;
};

*!*
let admin = user;
*/!*
```

![](memory-user-john-admin.svg)

Now if we do the same:

```js
user = null;
```

...Then the object is still reachable via `admin` global variable, so it&#39;s in memory. If we overwrite `admin` too, then it can be removed.

## Interlinked objects

Now a more complex example. The family:

```js
function marry(man, woman) {
  woman.husband = man;
  man.wife = woman;

  return {
    father: man,
    mother: woman,
  };
}

let family = marry(
  {
    name: &quot;John&quot;,
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Ann&quot;,
  }
);
```

Function `marry` &quot;marries&quot; two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both.

The resulting memory structure:

![](family.svg)

As of now, all objects are reachable.

Now let&#39;s remove two references:

```js
delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
```

![](family-delete-refs.svg)

It&#39;s not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.

But if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:

![](family-no-father.svg)

Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

After garbage collection:

![](family-no-father-2.svg)

## Unreachable island

It is possible that the whole island of interlinked objects becomes unreachable and is removed from the memory.

The source object is the same as above. Then:

```js
family = null;
```

The in-memory picture becomes:

![](family-no-family.svg)

This example demonstrates how important the concept of reachability is.

It&#39;s obvious that John and Ann are still linked, both have incoming references. But that&#39;s not enough.

The former `&quot;family&quot;` object has been unlinked from the root, there&#39;s no reference to it any more, so the whole island becomes unreachable and will be removed.

## Internal algorithms

The basic garbage collection algorithm is called &quot;mark-and-sweep&quot;.

The following &quot;garbage collection&quot; steps are regularly performed:

- The garbage collector takes roots and &quot;marks&quot; (remembers) them.
- Then it visits and &quot;marks&quot; all references from them.
- Then it visits marked objects and marks _their_ references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
- ...And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
- All objects except marked ones are removed.

For instance, let our object structure look like this:

![](garbage-collection-1.svg)

We can clearly see an &quot;unreachable island&quot; to the right side. Now let&#39;s see how &quot;mark-and-sweep&quot; garbage collector deals with it.

The first step marks the roots:

![](garbage-collection-2.svg)

Then their references are marked:

![](garbage-collection-3.svg)

...And their references, while possible:

![](garbage-collection-4.svg)

Now the objects that could not be visited in the process are considered unreachable and will be removed:

![](garbage-collection-5.svg)

We can also imagine the process as spilling a huge bucket of paint from the roots, that flows through all references and marks all reachable objects. The unmarked ones are then removed.

That&#39;s the concept of how garbage collection works. JavaScript engines apply many optimizations to make it run faster and not affect the execution.

Some of the optimizations:

- **Generational collection** -- objects are split into two sets: &quot;new ones&quot; and &quot;old ones&quot;. Many objects appear, do their job and die fast, they can be cleaned up aggressively. Those that survive for long enough, become &quot;old&quot; and are examined less often.
- **Incremental collection** -- if there are many objects, and we try to walk and mark the whole object set at once, it may take some time and introduce visible delays in the execution. So the engine tries to split the garbage collection into pieces. Then the pieces are executed one by one, separately. That requires some extra bookkeeping between them to track changes, but we have many tiny delays instead of a big one.
- **Idle-time collection** -- the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, to reduce the possible effect on the execution.

There exist other optimizations and flavours of garbage collection algorithms. As much as I&#39;d like to describe them here, I have to hold off, because different engines implement different tweaks and techniques. And, what&#39;s even more important, things change as engines develop, so studying deeper &quot;in advance&quot;, without a real need is probably not worth that. Unless, of course, it is a matter of pure interest, then there will be some links for you below.

## Summary

The main things to know:

- Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
- Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.
- Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole.

Modern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.

A general book &quot;The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management&quot; (R. Jones et al) covers some of them.

If you are familiar with low-level programming, the more detailed information about V8 garbage collector is in the article [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection).

[V8 blog](https://v8.dev/) also publishes articles about changes in memory management from time to time. Naturally, to learn the garbage collection, you&#39;d better prepare by learning about V8 internals in general and read the blog of [Vyacheslav Egorov](http://mrale.ph) who worked as one of V8 engineers. I&#39;m saying: &quot;V8&quot;, because it is best covered with articles in the internet. For other engines, many approaches are similar, but garbage collection differs in many aspects.

In-depth knowledge of engines is good when you need low-level optimizations. It would be wise to plan that as the next step after you&#39;re familiar with the language.

# Object methods, &quot;this&quot;

Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

```js
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,
};
```

And, in the real world, a user can _act_: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.

## Method examples

For a start, let&#39;s teach the `user` to say hello:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30
};

*!*
user.sayHi = function() {
  alert(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
};
*/!*

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

Here we&#39;ve just used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to the property `user.sayHi` of the object.

Then we can call it as `user.sayHi()`. The user can now speak!

A function that is a property of an object is called its _method_.

So, here we&#39;ve got a method `sayHi` of the object `user`.

Of course, we could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  // ...
};

*!*
// first, declare
function sayHi() {
  alert(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
};

// then add as a method
user.sayHi = sayHi;
*/!*

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

```smart header=&quot;Object-oriented programming&quot;
When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that&#39;s called [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), in short: &quot;OOP&quot;.

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That&#39;s architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&quot; by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or &quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications&quot; by G. Booch, and more.
```

### Method shorthand

There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:

```js
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert(&quot;Hello&quot;);
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
*!*
  sayHi() { // same as &quot;sayHi: function(){...}&quot;
*/!*
    alert(&quot;Hello&quot;);
  }
};
```

As demonstrated, we can omit `&quot;function&quot;` and just write `sayHi()`.

To tell the truth, the notations are not fully identical. There are subtle differences related to object inheritance (to be covered later), but for now they do not matter. In almost all cases the shorter syntax is preferred.

## &quot;this&quot; in methods

It&#39;s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.

For instance, the code inside `user.sayHi()` may need the name of the `user`.

**To access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.**

The value of `this` is the object &quot;before dot&quot;, the one used to call the method.

For instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    // &quot;this&quot; is the &quot;current object&quot;
    alert(this.name);
*/!*
  }

};

user.sayHi(); // John
```

Here during the execution of `user.sayHi()`, the value of `this` will be `user`.

Technically, it&#39;s also possible to access the object without `this`, by referencing it via the outer variable:

```js
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    alert(user.name); // &quot;user&quot; instead of &quot;this&quot;
*/!*
  }

};
```

...But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy `user` to another variable, e.g. `admin = user` and overwrite `user` with something else, then it will access the wrong object.

That&#39;s demonstrated below:

```js run
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
*/!*
  }

};


let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

*!*
admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property &#39;name&#39; of null
*/!*
```

If we used `this.name` instead of `user.name` inside the `alert`, then the code would work.

## &quot;this&quot; is not bound

In JavaScript, keyword `this` behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it&#39;s not a method of an object.

There&#39;s no syntax error in the following example:

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( *!*this*/!*.name );
}
```

The value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different &quot;this&quot; in the calls:

```js run
let user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };
let admin = { name: &quot;Admin&quot; };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

*!*
// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;
*/!*

// these calls have different this
// &quot;this&quot; inside the function is the object &quot;before the dot&quot;
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin[&#39;f&#39;](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn&#39;t matter)
```

The rule is simple: if `obj.f()` is called, then `this` is `obj` during the call of `f`. So it&#39;s either `user` or `admin` in the example above.

````smart header=&quot;Calling without an object: `this == undefined`&quot;
We can even call the function without an object at all:

```js run
function sayHi() {
  alert(this);
}

sayHi(); // undefined
```

In this case `this` is `undefined` in strict mode. If we try to access `this.name`, there will be an error.

In non-strict mode the value of `this` in such case will be the _global object_ (`window` in a browser, we&#39;ll get to it later in the chapter [](info:global-object)). This is a historical behavior that `&quot;use strict&quot;` fixes.

Usually such call is a programming error. If there&#39;s `this` inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context.

<p>``<code>smart header="The consequences of unbound</code>this<code>" If you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a "bound</code>this<code>", where methods defined in an object always have</code>this` referencing that object.</p>
<p>In JavaScript <code>this</code> is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.</p>
<p>The concept of run-time evaluated <code>this</code> has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="arrow-functions-have-no-this">Arrow functions have no “this”</h2>
<p>Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” <code>this</code>. If we reference <code>this</code> from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.</p>
<p>For instance, here <code>arrow()</code> uses <code>this</code> from the outer <code>user.sayHi()</code> method:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { firstName: “Ilya”, sayHi() { let arrow = () =&gt; alert(this.firstName); arrow(); } };</p>
<p>user.sayHi(); // Ilya ```</p>
<p>That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate <code>this</code>, but rather to take it from the outer context.

<h2 id="summary-23">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
<li>Methods allow objects to “act” like <code>object.doSomething()</code>.</li>

</ul>
<p>The value of <code>this</code> is defined at run-time. - When a function is declared, it may use <code>this</code>, but that <code>this</code> has no value until the function is called. - A function can be copied between objects. - When a function is called in the “method” syntax: <code>object.method()</code>, the value of <code>this</code> during the call is <code>object</code>.</p>

<p>The regular <code>{...}</code> syntax allows to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.</p>
<p>That can be done using constructor functions and the <code>"new"</code> operator.</p>
<h2 id="constructor-function">Constructor function</h2>
<p>Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They are named with capital letter first.</li>
<li>They should be executed only with <code>"new"</code> operator.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run function User(name) { this.name = name; this.isAdmin = false; }</p>
<p><em>!</em> let user = new User(“Jack”); <em>/!</em></p>
<p>alert(user.name); // Jack alert(user.isAdmin); // false ```</p>
<p>When a function is executed with <code>new</code>, it does the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A new empty object is created and assigned to <code>this</code>.</li>
<li>The function body executes. Usually it modifies <code>this</code>, adds new properties to it.</li>
<li>The value of <code>this</code> is returned.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, <code>new User(...)</code> does something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb180"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">User</span>(name) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>Now if we want to create other users, we can call <code>new User("Ann")</code>, <code>new User("Alice")</code> and so on. Much shorter than using literals every time, and also easy to read.</p>
<p>That’s the main purpose of constructors – to implement reusable object creation code.</p>
<p>Let’s note once again – technically, any function can be used as a constructor. That is: any function can be run with <code>new</code>, and it will execute the algorithm above.

<p>The constructor can’t be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.</p>
<pre><code>
## Constructor mode test: new.target

```smart header=&quot;Advanced stuff&quot;
The syntax from this section is rarely used, skip it unless you want to know everything.
```

Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with `new` or without it, using a special `new.target` property.

It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with `new`:

```js run
function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}

// without &quot;new&quot;:
*!*
User(); // undefined
*/!*

// with &quot;new&quot;:
*!*
new User(); // function User { ... }
*/!*
```

That can be used inside the function to know whether it was called with `new`, &quot;in constructor mode&quot;, or without it, &quot;in regular mode&quot;.

We can also make both `new` and regular calls to do the same, like this:

```js run
function User(name) {
  if (!new.target) {
    // if you run me without new
    return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you
  }

  this.name = name;
}

let john = User(&quot;John&quot;); // redirects call to new User
alert(john.name); // John
```

This approach is sometimes used in libraries to make the syntax more flexible. So that people may call the function with or without `new`, and it still works.

Probably not a good thing to use everywhere though, because omitting `new` makes it a bit less obvious what&#39;s going on. With `new` we all know that the new object is being created.

## Return from constructors

Usually, constructors do not have a `return` statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into `this`, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a `return` statement, then the rule is simple:

- If `return` is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of `this`.
- If `return` is called with a primitive, it&#39;s ignored.

In other words, `return` with an object returns that object, in all other cases `this` is returned.

For instance, here `return` overrides `this` by returning an object:

```js run
function BigUser() {
  this.name = &quot;John&quot;;

  return { name: &quot;Godzilla&quot; }; // &lt;-- returns this object
}

alert(new BigUser().name); // Godzilla, got that object
```

And here&#39;s an example with an empty `return` (or we could place a primitive after it, doesn&#39;t matter):

```js run
function SmallUser() {
  this.name = &quot;John&quot;;

  return; // &lt;-- returns this
}

alert(new SmallUser().name); // John
```

Usually constructors don&#39;t have a `return` statement. Here we mention the special behavior with returning objects mainly for the sake of completeness.

````smart header=&quot;Omitting parentheses&quot;
By the way, we can omit parentheses after `new`, if it has no arguments:

```js
let user = new User; // &lt;-- no parentheses
// same as
let user = new User();
```

Omitting parentheses here is not considered a &quot;good style&quot;, but the syntax is permitted by specification.
````

## Methods in constructor

Using constructor functions to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.

Of course, we can add to `this` not only properties, but methods as well.

For instance, `new User(name)` below creates an object with the given `name` and the method `sayHi`:

```js run
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;

  this.sayHi = function() {
    alert( &quot;My name is: &quot; + this.name );
  };
}

*!*
let john = new User(&quot;John&quot;);

john.sayHi(); // My name is: John

To create complex objects, there&#39;s a more advanced syntax, [classes](info:classes), that we&#39;ll cover later.

## Summary

- Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but there&#39;s a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.
- Constructor functions should only be called using `new`. Such a call implies a creation of empty `this` at the start and returning the populated one at the end.

We can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.

JavaScript provides constructor functions for many built-in language objects: like `Date` for dates, `Set` for sets and others that we plan to study.

```smart header=&quot;Objects, we&#39;ll be back!&quot;
In this chapter we only cover the basics about objects and constructors. They are essential for learning more about data types and functions in the next chapters.

After we learn that, we return to objects and cover them in-depth in the chapters &lt;info:prototypes&gt; and &lt;info:classes&gt;.

# Optional chaining &#39;?.&#39;

[recent browser=&quot;new&quot;]

The optional chaining `?.` is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn&#39;t exist.

## The &quot;non-existing property&quot; problem

If you&#39;ve just started to read the tutorial and learn JavaScript, maybe the problem hasn&#39;t touched you yet, but it&#39;s quite common.

As an example, let&#39;s say we have `user` objects that hold the information about our users.

Most of our users have addresses in `user.address` property, with the street `user.address.street`, but some did not provide them.

In such case, when we attempt to get `user.address.street`, and the user happens to be without an address, we get an error:

```js run
let user = {}; // a user without &quot;address&quot; property

alert(user.address.street); // Error!
```

That&#39;s the expected result. JavaScript works like this. As `user.address` is `undefined`, an attempt to get `user.address.street` fails with an error.

In many practical cases we&#39;d prefer to get `undefined` instead of an error here (meaning &quot;no street&quot;).

...And another example. In the web development, we can get an object that corresponds to a web page element using a special method call, such as `document.querySelector(&#39;.elem&#39;)`, and it returns `null` when there&#39;s no such element.

```js run
// document.querySelector(&#39;.elem&#39;) is null if there&#39;s no element
let html = document.querySelector(&quot;.elem&quot;).innerHTML; // error if it&#39;s null
```

Once again, if the element doesn&#39;t exist, we&#39;ll get an error accessing `.innerHTML` of `null`. And in some cases, when the absence of the element is normal, we&#39;d like to avoid the error and just accept `html = null` as the result.

How can we do this?

The obvious solution would be to check the value using `if` or the conditional operator `?`, before accessing its property, like this:

```js
let user = {};

alert(user.address ? user.address.street : undefined);
```

It works, there&#39;s no error... But it&#39;s quite inelegant. As you can see, the `&quot;user.address&quot;` appears twice in the code. For more deeply nested properties, that becomes a problem as more repetitions are required.

E.g. let&#39;s try getting `user.address.street.name`.

We need to check both `user.address` and `user.address.street`:

```js
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert(
  user.address ? (user.address.street ? user.address.street.name : null) : null
);
```

That&#39;s just awful, one may even have problems understanding such code.

Don&#39;t even care to, as there&#39;s a better way to write it, using the `&amp;&amp;` operator:

```js run
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert(user.address &amp;&amp; user.address.street &amp;&amp; user.address.street.name); // undefined (no error)
```

AND&#39;ing the whole path to the property ensures that all components exist (if not, the evaluation stops), but also isn&#39;t ideal.

As you can see, property names are still duplicated in the code. E.g. in the code above, `user.address` appears three times.

That&#39;s why the optional chaining `?.` was added to the language. To solve this problem once and for all!

## Optional chaining

The optional chaining `?.` stops the evaluation if the value before `?.` is `undefined` or `null` and returns `undefined`.

**Further in this article, for brevity, we&#39;ll be saying that something &quot;exists&quot; if it&#39;s not `null` and not `undefined`.**

In other words, `value?.prop`:

- works as `value.prop`, if `value` exists,
- otherwise (when `value` is `undefined/null`) it returns `undefined`.

Here&#39;s the safe way to access `user.address.street` using `?.`:

```js run
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert(user?.address?.street); // undefined (no error)
```

The code is short and clean, there&#39;s no duplication at all.

Reading the address with `user?.address` works even if `user` object doesn&#39;t exist:

```js run
let user = null;

alert(user?.address); // undefined
alert(user?.address.street); // undefined
```

Please note: the `?.` syntax makes optional the value before it, but not any further.

E.g. in `user?.address.street.name` the `?.` allows `user` to safely be `null/undefined` (and returns `undefined` in that case), but that&#39;s only for `user`. Further properties are accessed in a regular way. If we want some of them to be optional, then we&#39;ll need to replace more `.` with `?.`.

```warn header=&quot;Don&#39;t overuse the optional chaining&quot;
We should use `?.` only where it&#39;s ok that something doesn&#39;t exist.

For example, if according to our coding logic `user` object must exist, but `address` is optional, then we should write `user.address?.street`, but not `user?.address?.street`.

So, if `user` happens to be undefined due to a mistake, we&#39;ll see a programming error about it and fix it. Otherwise, coding errors can be silenced where not appropriate, and become more difficult to debug.
```

````warn header=&quot;The variable before `?.`must be declared&quot; If there&#39;s no variable`user`at all, then`user?.anything` triggers an error:

```js run
// ReferenceError: user is not defined
user?.address;
```

The variable must be declared (e.g. `let/const/var user` or as a function parameter). The optional chaining works only for declared variables.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="short-circuiting">Short-circuiting</h2>
<p>As it was said before, the <code>?.</code> immediately stops (“short-circuits”) the evaluation if the left part doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>So, if there are any further function calls or side effects, they don’t occur.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let user = null; let x = 0;</p>
<p>user?.sayHi(x++); // no “sayHi”, so the execution doesn’t reach x++</p>
<p>alert(x); // 0, value not incremented ```</p>
<h2 id="other-variants-.-.">Other variants: ?.(), ?.[]</h2>
<p>The optional chaining <code>?.</code> is not an operator, but a special syntax construct, that also works with functions and square brackets.</p>
<p>For example, <code>?.()</code> is used to call a function that may not exist.</p>
<p>In the code below, some of our users have <code>admin</code> method, and some don’t:</p>
<p>```js run let userAdmin = { admin() { alert(“I am admin”); } };</p>
<p>let userGuest = {};</p>
<p><em>!</em> userAdmin.admin?.(); // I am admin <em>/!</em></p>
<p><em>!</em> userGuest.admin?.(); // nothing (no such method) <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>Here, in both lines we first use the dot (<code>userAdmin.admin</code>) to get <code>admin</code> property, because we assume that the user object exists, so it’s safe read from it.</p>
<p>Then <code>?.()</code> checks the left part: if the admin function exists, then it runs (that’s so for <code>userAdmin</code>). Otherwise (for <code>userGuest</code>) the evaluation stops without errors.</p>
<p>The <code>?.[]</code> syntax also works, if we’d like to use brackets <code>[]</code> to access properties instead of dot <code>.</code>. Similar to previous cases, it allows to safely read a property from an object that may not exist.</p>
<p>```js run let key = “firstName”;</p>
<p>let user1 = { firstName: “John” };</p>
<p>let user2 = null;</p>
<p>alert( user1?.[key] ); // John alert( user2?.[key] ); // undefined ```</p>
<p>Also we can use <code>?.</code> with <code>delete</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run delete user?.name; // delete user.name if user exists</code></p>
<p>```<code>warn header="We can use</code>?.<code>for safe reading and deleting, but not writing" The optional chaining</code>?.` has no use at the left side of an assignment.</p>
<p>For example: ```js run let user = null;</p>
<p>user?.name = “John”; // Error, doesn’t work // because it evaluates to undefined = “John”</p>
<pre><code>
It&#39;s just not that smart.</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary-24">Summary</h2>
<p>The optional chaining <code>?.</code> syntax has three forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>obj?.prop</code> – returns <code>obj.prop</code> if <code>obj</code> exists, otherwise <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li><code>obj?.[prop]</code> – returns <code>obj[prop]</code> if <code>obj</code> exists, otherwise <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li><code>obj.method?.()</code> – calls <code>obj.method()</code> if <code>obj.method</code> exists, otherwise returns <code>undefined</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, all of them are straightforward and simple to use. The <code>?.</code> checks the left part for <code>null/undefined</code> and allows the evaluation to proceed if it’s not so.</p>
<p>A chain of <code>?.</code> allows to safely access nested properties.</p>
<p>Still, we should apply <code>?.</code> carefully, only where it’s acceptable that the left part doesn’t exist. So that it won’t hide programming errors from us, if they occur.</p>
<h1 id="symbol-type">Symbol type</h1>
<p>By specification, object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type. Not numbers, not booleans, only strings or symbols, these two types.</p>
<p>Till now we’ve been using only strings. Now let’s see the benefits that symbols can give us.</p>
<h2 id="symbols">Symbols</h2>
<p>A “symbol” represents a unique identifier.</p>
<p>A value of this type can be created using <code>Symbol()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb185"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb185-1" title="1"><span class="co">// id is a new symbol</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb185-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> id <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Upon creation, we can give symbol a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb186"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-1" title="1"><span class="co">// id is a symbol with the description &quot;id&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> id <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;id&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.</p>
<p>For instance, here are two symbols with the same description – they are not equal:</p>
<p>```js run let id1 = Symbol(“id”); let id2 = Symbol(“id”);</p>
<p><em>!</em> alert(id1 == id2); // false <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Ruby or another language that also has some sort of “symbols” – please don’t be misguided. JavaScript symbols are different.</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Symbols don't auto-convert to a string" Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can</code>alert` almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don’t auto-convert.</p>
<p>For instance, this <code>alert</code> will show an error:</p>
<p><code>js run let id = Symbol("id"); *!* alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string */!*</code></p>
<p>That’s a “language guard” against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different and should not accidentally convert one into another.</p>
<p>If we really want to show a symbol, we need to explicitly call <code>.toString()</code> on it, like here: <code>js run let id = Symbol("id"); *!* alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works */!*</code></p>
<p>Or get <code>symbol.description</code> property to show the description only: <code>js run let id = Symbol("id"); *!* alert(id.description); // id */!*</code></p>
<pre><code>
## &quot;Hidden&quot; properties

Symbols allow us to create &quot;hidden&quot; properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.

For instance, if we&#39;re working with `user` objects, that belong to a third-party code. We&#39;d like to add identifiers to them.

Let&#39;s use a symbol key for it:

```js run
let user = {
  // belongs to another code
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
};

let id = Symbol(&quot;id&quot;);

user[id] = 1;

alert(user[id]); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
```

What&#39;s the benefit of using `Symbol(&quot;id&quot;)` over a string `&quot;id&quot;`?

As `user` objects belongs to another code, and that code also works with them, we shouldn&#39;t just add any fields to it. That&#39;s unsafe. But a symbol cannot be accessed accidentally, the third-party code probably won&#39;t even see it, so it&#39;s probably all right to do.

Also, imagine that another script wants to have its own identifier inside `user`, for its own purposes. That may be another JavaScript library, so that the scripts are completely unaware of each other.

Then that script can create its own `Symbol(&quot;id&quot;)`, like this:

```js
// ...
let id = Symbol(&quot;id&quot;);

user[id] = &quot;Their id value&quot;;
```

There will be no conflict between our and their identifiers, because symbols are always different, even if they have the same name.

...But if we used a string `&quot;id&quot;` instead of a symbol for the same purpose, then there _would_ be a conflict:

```js
let user = { name: &quot;John&quot; };

// Our script uses &quot;id&quot; property
user.id = &quot;Our id value&quot;;

// ...Another script also wants &quot;id&quot; for its purposes...

user.id = &quot;Their id value&quot;;
// Boom! overwritten by another script!
```

### Symbols in an object literal

If we want to use a symbol in an object literal `{...}`, we need square brackets around it.

Like this:

```js
let id = Symbol(&quot;id&quot;);

let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
*!*
  [id]: 123 // not &quot;id&quot;: 123
*/!*
};
```

That&#39;s because we need the value from the variable `id` as the key, not the string &quot;id&quot;.

### Symbols are skipped by for..in

Symbolic properties do not participate in `for..in` loop.

For instance:

```js run
let id = Symbol(&quot;id&quot;);
let user = {
  name: &quot;John&quot;,
  age: 30,
  [id]: 123
};

*!*
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)
*/!*

// the direct access by the symbol works
alert( &quot;Direct: &quot; + user[id] );
```

`Object.keys(user)` also ignores them. That&#39;s a part of the general &quot;hiding symbolic properties&quot; principle. If another script or a library loops over our object, it won&#39;t unexpectedly access a symbolic property.

In contrast, [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) copies both string and symbol properties:

```js run
let id = Symbol(&quot;id&quot;);
let user = {
  [id]: 123,
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert(clone[id]); // 123
```

There&#39;s no paradox here. That&#39;s by design. The idea is that when we clone an object or merge objects, we usually want _all_ properties to be copied (including symbols like `id`).

## Global symbols

As we&#39;ve seen, usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol `&quot;id&quot;` meaning exactly the same property.

To achieve that, there exists a _global symbol registry_. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.

In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use `Symbol.for(key)`.

That call checks the global registry, and if there&#39;s a symbol described as `key`, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol `Symbol(key)` and stores it in the registry by the given `key`.

For instance:

```js run
// read from the global registry
let id = Symbol.for(&quot;id&quot;); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for(&quot;id&quot;);

// the same symbol
alert(id === idAgain); // true
```

Symbols inside the registry are called _global symbols_. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code -- that&#39;s what they are for.

```smart header=&quot;That sounds like Ruby&quot;
In some programming languages, like Ruby, there&#39;s a single symbol per name.

In JavaScript, as we can see, that&#39;s right for global symbols.
```

### Symbol.keyFor

For global symbols, not only `Symbol.for(key)` returns a symbol by name, but there&#39;s a reverse call: `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`, that does the reverse: returns a name by a global symbol.

For instance:

```js run
// get symbol by name
let sym = Symbol.for(&quot;name&quot;);
let sym2 = Symbol.for(&quot;id&quot;);

// get name by symbol
alert(Symbol.keyFor(sym)); // name
alert(Symbol.keyFor(sym2)); // id
```

The `Symbol.keyFor` internally uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol. So it doesn&#39;t work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global, it won&#39;t be able to find it and returns `undefined`.

That said, any symbols have `description` property.

For instance:

```js run
let globalSymbol = Symbol.for(&quot;name&quot;);
let localSymbol = Symbol(&quot;name&quot;);

alert(Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol)); // name, global symbol
alert(Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol)); // undefined, not global

alert(localSymbol.description); // name
```

## System symbols

There exist many &quot;system&quot; symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our objects.

They are listed in the specification in the [Well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table:

- `Symbol.hasInstance`
- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`
- `Symbol.iterator`
- `Symbol.toPrimitive`
- ...and so on.

For instance, `Symbol.toPrimitive` allows us to describe object to primitive conversion. We&#39;ll see its use very soon.

Other symbols will also become familiar when we study the corresponding language features.

## Summary

`Symbol` is a primitive type for unique identifiers.

Symbols are created with `Symbol()` call with an optional description (name).

Symbols are always different values, even if they have the same name. If we want same-named symbols to be equal, then we should use the global registry: `Symbol.for(key)` returns (creates if needed) a global symbol with `key` as the name. Multiple calls of `Symbol.for` with the same `key` return exactly the same symbol.

Symbols have two main use cases:

1. &quot;Hidden&quot; object properties.
   If we want to add a property into an object that &quot;belongs&quot; to another script or a library, we can create a symbol and use it as a property key. A symbolic property does not appear in `for..in`, so it won&#39;t be accidentally processed together with other properties. Also it won&#39;t be accessed directly, because another script does not have our symbol. So the property will be protected from accidental use or overwrite.

   So we can &quot;covertly&quot; hide something into objects that we need, but others should not see, using symbolic properties.

2. There are many system symbols used by JavaScript which are accessible as `Symbol.*`. We can use them to alter some built-in behaviors. For instance, later in the tutorial we&#39;ll use `Symbol.iterator` for [iterables](info:iterable), `Symbol.toPrimitive` to setup [object-to-primitive conversion](info:object-toprimitive) and so on.

Technically, symbols are not 100% hidden. There is a built-in method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that allows us to get all symbols. Also there is a method named [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns _all_ keys of an object including symbolic ones. So they are not really hidden. But most libraries, built-in functions and syntax constructs don&#39;t use these methods.

# Object to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added `obj1 + obj2`, subtracted `obj1 - obj2` or printed using `alert(obj)`?

In that case, objects are auto-converted to primitives, and then the operation is carried out.

In the chapter &lt;info:type-conversions&gt; we&#39;ve seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to fill it.

1. All objects are `true` in a boolean context. There are only numeric and string conversions.
2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter &lt;info:date&gt;) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.
3. As for the string conversion -- it usually happens when we output an object like `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.

## ToPrimitive

We can fine-tune string and numeric conversion, using special object methods.

There are three variants of type conversion, so-called &quot;hints&quot;, described in the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive):

`&quot;string&quot;`
: For an object-to-string conversion, when we&#39;re doing an operation on an object that expects a string, like `alert`:

    ```js
    // output
    alert(obj);

    // using object as a property key
    anotherObj[obj] = 123;
    ```

`&quot;number&quot;`
: For an object-to-number conversion, like when we&#39;re doing maths:

    ```js
    // explicit conversion
    let num = Number(obj);

    // maths (except binary plus)
    let n = +obj; // unary plus
    let delta = date1 - date2;

    // less/greater comparison
    let greater = user1 &gt; user2;
    ```

`&quot;default&quot;`
: Occurs in rare cases when the operator is &quot;not sure&quot; what type to expect.

    For instance, binary plus `+` can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. So if a binary plus gets an object as an argument, it uses the `&quot;default&quot;` hint to convert it.

    Also, if an object is compared using `==` with a string, number or a symbol, it&#39;s also unclear which conversion should be done, so the `&quot;default&quot;` hint is used.

    ```js
    // binary plus uses the &quot;default&quot; hint
    let total = obj1 + obj2;

    // obj == number uses the &quot;default&quot; hint
    if (user == 1) { ... };
    ```

    The greater and less comparison operators, such as `&lt;` `&gt;`, can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, they use the `&quot;number&quot;` hint, not `&quot;default&quot;`. That&#39;s for historical reasons.

    In practice though, we don&#39;t need to remember these peculiar details, because all built-in objects except for one case (`Date` object, we&#39;ll learn it later) implement `&quot;default&quot;` conversion the same way as `&quot;number&quot;`. And we can do the same.

```smart header=&quot;No `\&quot;boolean\&quot;` hint&quot;
Please note -- there are only three hints. It&#39;s that simple.

There is no &quot;boolean&quot; hint (all objects are `true` in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat `&quot;default&quot;` and `&quot;number&quot;` the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Call <code>obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)</code> - the method with the symbolic key <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> (system symbol), if such method exists,</li>
<li>Otherwise if hint is <code>"string"</code>
<ul>
<li>try <code>obj.toString()</code> and <code>obj.valueOf()</code>, whatever exists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Otherwise if hint is <code>"number"</code> or <code>"default"</code>
<ul>
<li>try <code>obj.valueOf()</code> and <code>obj.toString()</code>, whatever exists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="symbol.toprimitive">Symbol.toPrimitive</h2>
<p>Let’s start from the first method. There’s a built-in symbol named <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> that should be used to name the conversion method, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb188"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-1" title="1">obj[<span class="va">Symbol</span>.<span class="at">toPrimitive</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(hint) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// must return a primitive value</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-3" title="3">  <span class="co">// hint = one of &quot;string&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;default&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>For instance, here <code>user</code> object implements it:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, money: 1000,</p>
<p><a href="hint">Symbol.toPrimitive</a> { alert(<code>hint: ${hint}</code>); return hint == “string” ? <code>{name: "${this.name}"}</code> : this.money; }, };</p>
<p>// conversions demo: alert(user); // hint: string -&gt; {name: “John”} alert(+user); // hint: number -&gt; 1000 alert(user + 500); // hint: default -&gt; 1500 ```</p>
<p>As we can see from the code, <code>user</code> becomes a self-descriptive string or a money amount depending on the conversion. The single method <code>user[Symbol.toPrimitive]</code> handles all conversion cases.</p>
<h2 id="tostringvalueof">toString/valueOf</h2>
<p>Methods <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> come from ancient times. They are not symbols (symbols did not exist that long ago), but rather “regular” string-named methods. They provide an alternative “old-style” way to implement the conversion.</p>
<p>If there’s no <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> then JavaScript tries to find them and try in the order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>toString -&gt; valueOf</code> for “string” hint.</li>
<li><code>valueOf -&gt; toString</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods must return a primitive value. If <code>toString</code> or <code>valueOf</code> returns an object, then it’s ignored (same as if there were no method).</p>
<p>By default, a plain object has following <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>toString</code> method returns a string <code>"[object Object]"</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>valueOf</code> method returns the object itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the demo:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John” };</p>
<p>alert(user); // [object Object] alert(user.valueOf() === user); // true ```</p>
<p>So if we try to use an object as a string, like in an <code>alert</code> or so, then by default we see <code>[object Object]</code>.</p>
<p>And the default <code>valueOf</code> is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness, to avoid any confusion. As you can see, it returns the object itself, and so is ignored. Don’t ask me why, that’s for historical reasons. So we can assume it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Let’s implement these methods.</p>
<p>For instance, here <code>user</code> does the same as above using a combination of <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> instead of <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, money: 1000,</p>
<p>// for hint=“string” toString() { return <code>{name: "${this.name}"}</code>; },</p>
<p>// for hint=“number” or “default” valueOf() { return this.money; }, };</p>
<p>alert(user); // toString -&gt; {name: “John”} alert(+user); // valueOf -&gt; 1000 alert(user + 500); // valueOf -&gt; 1500 ```</p>
<p>As we can see, the behavior is the same as the previous example with <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code>.</p>
<p>Often we want a single “catch-all” place to handle all primitive conversions. In this case, we can implement <code>toString</code> only, like this:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”,</p>
<p>toString() { return this.name; }, };</p>
<p>alert(user); // toString -&gt; John alert(user + 500); // toString -&gt; John500 ```</p>
<p>In the absence of <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> and <code>valueOf</code>, <code>toString</code> will handle all primitive conversions.</p>
<h2 id="return-types">Return types</h2>
<p>The important thing to know about all primitive-conversion methods is that they do not necessarily return the “hinted” primitive.</p>
<p>There is no control whether <code>toString</code> returns exactly a string, or whether <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> method returns a number for a hint <code>"number"</code>.</p>
<p>The only mandatory thing: these methods must return a primitive, not an object.</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="Historical notes" For historical reasons, if</code>toString<code>or</code>valueOf` returns an object, there’s no error, but such value is ignored (like if the method didn’t exist). That’s because in ancient times there was no good “error” concept in JavaScript.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code> <em>must</em> return a primitive, otherwise there will be an error. ```</p>
<h2 id="further-conversions">Further conversions</h2>
<p>As we know already, many operators and functions perform type conversions, e.g. multiplication <code>*</code> converts operands to numbers.</p>
<p>If we pass an object as an argument, then there are two stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The object is converted to a primitive (using the rules described above).</li>
<li>If the resulting primitive isn’t of the right type, it’s converted.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let obj = { // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods toString() { return “2”; }, };</p>
<p>alert(obj * 2); // 4, object converted to primitive “2”, then multiplication made it a number ```</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The multiplication <code>obj * 2</code> first converts the object to primitive (that’s a string <code>"2"</code>).</li>
<li>Then <code>"2" * 2</code> becomes <code>2 * 2</code> (the string is converted to number).</li>
</ol>
<p>Binary plus will concatenate strings in the same situation, as it gladly accepts a string:</p>
<p>```js run let obj = { toString() { return “2”; }, };</p>
<p>alert(obj + 2); // 22 (“2” + 2), conversion to primitive returned a string =&gt; concatenation ```</p>
<h2 id="summary-25">Summary</h2>
<p>The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.</p>
<p>There are 3 types (hints) of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"string"</code> (for <code>alert</code> and other operations that need a string)</li>
<li><code>"number"</code> (for maths)</li>
<li><code>"default"</code> (few operators)</li>
</ul>
<p>The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint. There are very few operators that “don’t know what to expect” and use the <code>"default"</code> hint. Usually for built-in objects <code>"default"</code> hint is handled the same way as <code>"number"</code>, so in practice the last two are often merged together.</p>
<p>The conversion algorithm is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Call <code>obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)</code> if the method exists,</li>
<li>Otherwise if hint is <code>"string"</code>
<ul>
<li>try <code>obj.toString()</code> and <code>obj.valueOf()</code>, whatever exists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Otherwise if hint is <code>"number"</code> or <code>"default"</code>
<ul>
<li>try <code>obj.valueOf()</code> and <code>obj.toString()</code>, whatever exists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, it’s often enough to implement only <code>obj.toString()</code> as a “catch-all” method for all conversions that return a “human-readable” representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.</p>
<h1 id="methods-of-primitives">Methods of primitives</h1>
<p>JavaScript allows us to work with primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) as if they were objects. They also provide methods to call as such. We will study those soon, but first we’ll see how it works because, of course, primitives are not objects (and here we will make it even clearer).</p>
<p>Let’s look at the key distinctions between primitives and objects.</p>
<p>A primitive</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a value of a primitive type.</li>
<li>There are 7 primitive types: <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An object</p>
<ul>
<li>Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.</li>
<li>Can be created with <code>{}</code>, for instance: <code>{name: "John", age: 30}</code>. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its properties.</p>
<p>```js run let john = { name: “John”, sayHi: function () { alert(“Hi buddy!”); }, };</p>
<p>john.sayHi(); // Hi buddy! ```</p>
<p>So here we’ve made an object <code>john</code> with the method <code>sayHi</code>.</p>
<p>Many built-in objects already exist, such as those that work with dates, errors, HTML elements, etc. They have different properties and methods.</p>
<p>But, these features come with a cost!</p>
<p>Objects are “heavier” than primitives. They require additional resources to support the internal machinery.</p>
<h2 id="a-primitive-as-an-object">A primitive as an object</h2>
<p>Here’s the paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many things one would want to do with a primitive like a string or a number. It would be great to access them as methods.</li>
<li>Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.</li>
<li>The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.</li>
<li>In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code> and <code>Symbol</code>. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.</p>
<p>For instance, there exists a string method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase">str.toUpperCase()</a> that returns a capitalized <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Hello”;</p>
<p>alert(str.toUpperCase()); // HELLO ```</p>
<p>Simple, right? Here’s what actually happens in <code>str.toUpperCase()</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The string <code>str</code> is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like <code>toUpperCase()</code>.</li>
<li>That method runs and returns a new string (shown by <code>alert</code>).</li>
<li>The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive <code>str</code> alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>So primitives can provide methods, but they still remain lightweight.</p>
<p>The JavaScript engine highly optimizes this process. It may even skip the creation of the extra object at all. But it must still adhere to the specification and behave as if it creates one.</p>
<p>A number has methods of its own, for instance, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed">toFixed(n)</a> rounds the number to the given precision:</p>
<p>```js run let n = 1.23456;</p>
<p>alert(n.toFixed(2)); // 1.23 ```</p>
<p>We’ll see more specific methods in chapters <a href="info:number" class="uri">info:number</a> and <a href="info:string" class="uri">info:string</a>.</p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Constructors</code>String/Number/Boolean<code>are for internal use only" Some languages like Java allow us to explicitly create "wrapper objects" for primitives using a syntax like</code>new Number(1)<code>or</code>new Boolean(false)`.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, that’s also possible for historical reasons, but highly <strong>unrecommended</strong>. Things will go crazy in several places.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run alert(typeof 0); // “number”</p>
<p>alert(typeof new Number(0)); // “object”! ```</p>
<p>Objects are always truthy in <code>if</code>, so here the alert will show up:</p>
<p>```js run let zero = new Number(0);</p>
<p>if (zero) { // zero is true, because it’s an object alert(“zero is truthy!?!”); } ```</p>
<p>On the other hand, using the same functions <code>String/Number/Boolean</code> without <code>new</code> is a totally sane and useful thing. They convert a value to the corresponding type: to a string, a number, or a boolean (primitive).</p>
<p>For example, this is entirely valid:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb189"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb189-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Number</span>(<span class="st">&quot;123&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// convert a string to number</span></a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>

````warn header=&quot;null/undefined have no methods&quot;
The special primitives `null` and `undefined` are exceptions. They have no corresponding &quot;wrapper objects&quot; and provide no methods. In a sense, they are &quot;the most primitive&quot;.

An attempt to access a property of such value would give the error:

```js run
alert(null.test); // error</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary-26">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primitives except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> provide many helpful methods. We will study those in the upcoming chapters.</li>
<li>Formally, these methods work via temporary objects, but JavaScript engines are well tuned to optimize that internally, so they are not expensive to call.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="numbers">Numbers</h1>
<p>In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision">IEEE-754</a>, also known as “double precision floating point numbers”. These are numbers that we’re using most of the time, and we’ll talk about them in this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>BigInt numbers, to represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed, because a regular number can’t exceed <code>2<sup>53</sup></code> or be less than <code>-2<sup>53</sup></code>. As bigints are used in few special areas, we devote them a special chapter <a href="info:bigint" class="uri">info:bigint</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So here we’ll talk about regular numbers. Let’s expand our knowledge of them.</p>
<h2 id="more-ways-to-write-a-number">More ways to write a number</h2>
<p>Imagine we need to write 1 billion. The obvious way is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb191"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb191-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> billion <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1000000000</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We also can use underscore <code>_</code> as the separator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb192"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb192-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> billion <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span>_000_000_000<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here the underscore <code>_</code> plays the role of the “syntactic sugar”, it makes the number more readable. The JavaScript engine simply ignores <code>_</code> between digits, so it’s exactly the same one billion as above.</p>
<p>In real life though, we try to avoid writing long sequences of zeroes. We’re too lazy for that. We’ll try to write something like <code>"1bn"</code> for a billion or <code>"7.3bn"</code> for 7 billion 300 million. The same is true for most large numbers.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, we can shorten a number by appending the letter <code>"e"</code> to it and specifying the zeroes count:</p>
<p>```js run let billion = 1e9; // 1 billion, literally: 1 and 9 zeroes</p>
<p>alert(7.3e9); // 7.3 billions (same as 7300000000 or 7_300_000_000) ```</p>
<p>In other words, <code>e</code> multiplies the number by <code>1</code> with the given zeroes count.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb193"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb193-1" title="1"><span class="fl">1e3</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">1000</span> <span class="co">// e3 means *1000</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb193-2" title="2"><span class="fl">1.23e6</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1.23</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">1000000</span> <span class="co">// e6 means *1000000</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s write something very small. Say, 1 microsecond (one millionth of a second):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb194"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb194-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> ms <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">0.000001</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Just like before, using <code>"e"</code> can help. If we’d like to avoid writing the zeroes explicitly, we could say the same as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb195"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb195-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> ms <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1e-6</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// six zeroes to the left from 1</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we count the zeroes in <code>0.000001</code>, there are 6 of them. So naturally it’s <code>1e-6</code>.</p>
<p>In other words, a negative number after <code>"e"</code> means a division by 1 with the given number of zeroes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb196"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb196-1" title="1"><span class="co">// -3 divides by 1 with 3 zeroes</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb196-2" title="2"><span class="fl">1e-3</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> / <span class="dv">1000</span> (<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.001</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb196-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb196-4" title="4"><span class="co">// -6 divides by 1 with 6 zeroes</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb196-5" title="5"><span class="fl">1.23e-6</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1.23</span> / <span class="dv">1000000</span> (<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.00000123</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="hex-binary-and-octal-numbers">Hex, binary and octal numbers</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">Hexadecimal</a> numbers are widely used in JavaScript to represent colors, encode characters, and for many other things. So naturally, there exists a shorter way to write them: <code>0x</code> and then the number.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(0xff); // 255 alert(0xff); // 255 (the same, case doesn't matter)</code></p>
<p>Binary and octal numeral systems are rarely used, but also supported using the <code>0b</code> and <code>0o</code> prefixes:</p>
<p>```js run let a = 0b11111111; // binary form of 255 let b = 0o377; // octal form of 255</p>
<p>alert(a == b); // true, the same number 255 at both sides ```</p>
<p>There are only 3 numeral systems with such support. For other numeral systems, we should use the function <code>parseInt</code> (which we will see later in this chapter).</p>
<h2 id="tostringbase">toString(base)</h2>
<p>The method <code>num.toString(base)</code> returns a string representation of <code>num</code> in the numeral system with the given <code>base</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>```js run let num = 255;</p>
<p>alert(num.toString(16)); // ff alert(num.toString(2)); // 11111111 ```</p>
<p>The <code>base</code> can vary from <code>2</code> to <code>36</code>. By default it’s <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>Common use cases for this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>base=16</strong> is used for hex colors, character encodings etc, digits can be <code>0..9</code> or <code>A..F</code>.</li>
<li><strong>base=2</strong> is mostly for debugging bitwise operations, digits can be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><p><strong>base=36</strong> is the maximum, digits can be <code>0..9</code> or <code>A..Z</code>. The whole latin alphabet is used to represent a number. A funny, but useful case for <code>36</code> is when we need to turn a long numeric identifier into something shorter, for example to make a short url. Can simply represent it in the numeral system with base <code>36</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run alert((123456).toString(36)); // 2n9c</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>``<code>warn header="Two dots to call a method" Please note that two dots in</code>123456..toString(36)<code>is not a typo. If we want to call a method directly on a number, like</code>toString<code>in the example above, then we need to place two dots</code>..` after it.</p>
<p>If we placed a single dot: <code>123456.toString(36)</code>, then there would be an error, because JavaScript syntax implies the decimal part after the first dot. And if we place one more dot, then JavaScript knows that the decimal part is empty and now goes the method.</p>
<p>Also could write <code>(123456).toString(36)</code>. ```</p>
<h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
<p>One of the most used operations when working with numbers is rounding.</p>
<p>There are several built-in functions for rounding:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>Math.floor</code></dt>
<dd>Rounds down: <code>3.1</code> becomes <code>3</code>, and <code>-1.1</code> becomes <code>-2</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>Math.ceil</code></dt>
<dd>Rounds up: <code>3.1</code> becomes <code>4</code>, and <code>-1.1</code> becomes <code>-1</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>Math.round</code></dt>
<dd>Rounds to the nearest integer: <code>3.1</code> becomes <code>3</code>, <code>3.6</code> becomes <code>4</code>, the middle case: <code>3.5</code> rounds up to <code>4</code> too.
</dd>
<dt><code>Math.trunc</code> (not supported by Internet Explorer)</dt>
<dd>Removes anything after the decimal point without rounding: <code>3.1</code> becomes <code>3</code>, <code>-1.1</code> becomes <code>-1</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here’s the table to summarize the differences between them:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th><code>Math.floor</code></th>
<th><code>Math.ceil</code></th>
<th><code>Math.round</code></th>
<th><code>Math.trunc</code></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</table>
<p>These functions cover all of the possible ways to deal with the decimal part of a number. But what if we’d like to round the number to <code>n-th</code> digit after the decimal?</p>
<p>For instance, we have <code>1.2345</code> and want to round it to 2 digits, getting only <code>1.23</code>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Multiply-and-divide.</p>
<p>For example, to round the number to the 2nd digit after the decimal, we can multiply the number by <code>100</code> (or a bigger power of 10), call the rounding function and then divide it back.</p>
<p>```js run let num = 1.23456;</p>
<p>alert(Math.round(num * 100) / 100); // 1.23456 -&gt; 123.456 -&gt; 123 -&gt; 1.23 ```</p></li>
<li><p>The method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed">toFixed(n)</a> rounds the number to <code>n</code> digits after the point and returns a string representation of the result.</p>
<p><code>js run let num = 12.34; alert(num.toFixed(1)); // "12.3"</code></p>
<p>This rounds up or down to the nearest value, similar to <code>Math.round</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run let num = 12.36; alert(num.toFixed(1)); // "12.4"</code></p>
<p>Please note that result of <code>toFixed</code> is a string. If the decimal part is shorter than required, zeroes are appended to the end:</p>
<p><code>js run let num = 12.34; alert(num.toFixed(5)); // "12.34000", added zeroes to make exactly 5 digits</code></p>
<p>We can convert it to a number using the unary plus or a <code>Number()</code> call: <code>+num.toFixed(5)</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="imprecise-calculations">Imprecise calculations</h2>
<p>Internally, a number is represented in 64-bit format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision">IEEE-754</a>, so there are exactly 64 bits to store a number: 52 of them are used to store the digits, 11 of them store the position of the decimal point (they are zero for integer numbers), and 1 bit is for the sign.</p>
<p>If a number is too big, it would overflow the 64-bit storage, potentially giving an infinity:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(1e500); // Infinity</code></p>
<p>What may be a little less obvious, but happens quite often, is the loss of precision.</p>
<p>Consider this (falsy!) test:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3); // *!*false*/!*</code></p>
<p>That’s right, if we check whether the sum of <code>0.1</code> and <code>0.2</code> is <code>0.3</code>, we get <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Strange! What is it then if not <code>0.3</code>?</p>
<p><code>js run alert(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004</code></p>
<p>Ouch! There are more consequences than an incorrect comparison here. Imagine you’re making an e-shopping site and the visitor puts <code>$0.10</code> and <code>$0.20</code> goods into their cart. The order total will be <code>$0.30000000000000004</code>. That would surprise anyone.</p>
<p>But why does this happen?</p>
<p>A number is stored in memory in its binary form, a sequence of bits - ones and zeroes. But fractions like <code>0.1</code>, <code>0.2</code> that look simple in the decimal numeric system are actually unending fractions in their binary form.</p>
<p>In other words, what is <code>0.1</code>? It is one divided by ten <code>1/10</code>, one-tenth. In decimal numeral system such numbers are easily representable. Compare it to one-third: <code>1/3</code>. It becomes an endless fraction <code>0.33333(3)</code>.</p>
<p>So, division by powers <code>10</code> is guaranteed to work well in the decimal system, but division by <code>3</code> is not. For the same reason, in the binary numeral system, the division by powers of <code>2</code> is guaranteed to work, but <code>1/10</code> becomes an endless binary fraction.</p>
<p>There’s just no way to store <em>exactly 0.1</em> or <em>exactly 0.2</em> using the binary system, just like there is no way to store one-third as a decimal fraction.</p>
<p>The numeric format IEEE-754 solves this by rounding to the nearest possible number. These rounding rules normally don’t allow us to see that “tiny precision loss”, but it exists.</p>
<p>We can see this in action:</p>
<p><code>js run alert((0.1).toFixed(20)); // 0.10000000000000000555</code></p>
<p>And when we sum two numbers, their “precision losses” add up.</p>
<p>That’s why <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> is not exactly <code>0.3</code>.</p>
<p>```smart header=“Not only JavaScript” The same issue exists in many other programming languages.</p>
<p>PHP, Java, C, Perl, Ruby give exactly the same result, because they are based on the same numeric format. ```</p>
<p>Can we work around the problem? Sure, the most reliable method is to round the result with the help of a method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed">toFixed(n)</a>:</p>
<p><code>js run let sum = 0.1 + 0.2; alert(sum.toFixed(2)); // 0.30</code></p>
<p>Please note that <code>toFixed</code> always returns a string. It ensures that it has 2 digits after the decimal point. That’s actually convenient if we have an e-shopping and need to show <code>$0.30</code>. For other cases, we can use the unary plus to coerce it into a number:</p>
<p><code>js run let sum = 0.1 + 0.2; alert(+sum.toFixed(2)); // 0.3</code></p>
<p>We also can temporarily multiply the numbers by 100 (or a bigger number) to turn them into integers, do the maths, and then divide back. Then, as we’re doing maths with integers, the error somewhat decreases, but we still get it on division:</p>
<p><code>js run alert((0.1 * 10 + 0.2 * 10) / 10); // 0.3 alert((0.28 * 100 + 0.14 * 100) / 100); // 0.4200000000000001</code></p>
<p>So, multiply/divide approach reduces the error, but doesn’t remove it totally.</p>
<p>Sometimes we could try to evade fractions at all. Like if we’re dealing with a shop, then we can store prices in cents instead of dollars. But what if we apply a discount of 30%? In practice, totally evading fractions is rarely possible. Just round them to cut “tails” when needed.</p>
<p>````smart header=“The funny thing” Try running this:</p>
<p><code>js run // Hello! I'm a self-increasing number! alert( 9999999999999999 ); // shows 10000000000000000</code></p>
<p>This suffers from the same issue: a loss of precision. There are 64 bits for the number, 52 of them can be used to store digits, but that’s not enough. So the least significant digits disappear.</p>
<p>JavaScript doesn’t trigger an error in such events. It does its best to fit the number into the desired format, but unfortunately, this format is not big enough.</p>
<pre><code>
```smart header=&quot;Two zeroes&quot;
Another funny consequence of the internal representation of numbers is the existence of two zeroes: `0` and `-0`.

That&#39;s because a sign is represented by a single bit, so it can be set or not set for any number including a zero.

In most cases the distinction is unnoticeable, because operators are suited to treat them as the same.
```

## Tests: isFinite and isNaN

Remember these two special numeric values?

- `Infinity` (and `-Infinity`) is a special numeric value that is greater (less) than anything.
- `NaN` represents an error.

They belong to the type `number`, but are not &quot;normal&quot; numbers, so there are special functions to check for them:

- `isNaN(value)` converts its argument to a number and then tests it for being `NaN`:

  ```js run
  alert(isNaN(NaN)); // true
  alert(isNaN(&quot;str&quot;)); // true
  ```

  But do we need this function? Can&#39;t we just use the comparison `=== NaN`? Sorry, but the answer is no. The value `NaN` is unique in that it does not equal anything, including itself:

  ```js run
  alert(NaN === NaN); // false
  ```

- `isFinite(value)` converts its argument to a number and returns `true` if it&#39;s a regular number, not `NaN/Infinity/-Infinity`:

  ```js run
  alert(isFinite(&quot;15&quot;)); // true
  alert(isFinite(&quot;str&quot;)); // false, because a special value: NaN
  alert(isFinite(Infinity)); // false, because a special value: Infinity
  ```

Sometimes `isFinite` is used to validate whether a string value is a regular number:

```js run
let num = +prompt(&quot;Enter a number&quot;, &quot;&quot;);

// will be true unless you enter Infinity, -Infinity or not a number
alert(isFinite(num));
```

Please note that an empty or a space-only string is treated as `0` in all numeric functions including `isFinite`.

```smart header=&quot;Compare with `Object.is`&quot;

There is a special built-in method [`Object.is`](mdn:js/Object/is) that compares values like `===`, but is more reliable for two edge cases:

1. It works with `NaN`: `Object.is(NaN, NaN) === true`, that&#39;s a good thing.
2. Values `0` and `-0` are different: `Object.is(0, -0) === false`, technically that&#39;s true, because internally the number has a sign bit that may be different even if all other bits are zeroes.

In all other cases, `Object.is(a, b)` is the same as `a === b`.

This way of comparison is often used in JavaScript specification. When an internal algorithm needs to compare two values for being exactly the same, it uses `Object.is` (internally called [SameValue](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-samevalue)).

<h2 id="parseint-and-parsefloat">parseInt and parseFloat</h2>
<p>Numeric conversion using a plus <code>+</code> or <code>Number()</code> is strict. If a value is not exactly a number, it fails:</p>
<p>```js run alert( +“100px” ); // NaN ````</p>
<p>The sole exception is spaces at the beginning or at the end of the string, as they are ignored.</p>
<p>But in real life we often have values in units, like <code>"100px"</code> or <code>"12pt"</code> in CSS. Also in many countries the currency symbol goes after the amount, so we have <code>"19€"</code> and would like to extract a numeric value out of that.</p>
<p>That’s what <code>parseInt</code> and <code>parseFloat</code> are for.</p>
<p>They “read” a number from a string until they can’t. In case of an error, the gathered number is returned. The function <code>parseInt</code> returns an integer, whilst <code>parseFloat</code> will return a floating-point number:</p>
<p>```js run alert(parseInt(“100px”)); // 100 alert(parseFloat(“12.5em”)); // 12.5</p>
<p>alert(parseInt(“12.3”)); // 12, only the integer part is returned alert(parseFloat(“12.3.4”)); // 12.3, the second point stops the reading ```</p>
<p>There are situations when <code>parseInt/parseFloat</code> will return <code>NaN</code>. It happens when no digits could be read:</p>
<p><code>js run alert(parseInt("a123")); // NaN, the first symbol stops the process</code></p>
<p>```<code>smart header="The second argument of</code>parseInt(str, radix)<code>" The</code>parseInt()<code>function has an optional second parameter. It specifies the base of the numeral system, so</code>parseInt` can also parse strings of hex numbers, binary numbers and so on:</p>
<p>```js run alert(parseInt(“0xff”, 16)); // 255 alert(parseInt(“ff”, 16)); // 255, without 0x also works</p>
<p>alert(parseInt(“2n9c”, 36)); // 123456</p>

<h2 id="summary-27">Summary</h2>
<p>To write numbers with many zeroes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Append <code>"e"</code> with the zeroes count to the number. Like: <code>123e6</code> is the same as <code>123</code> with 6 zeroes <code>123000000</code>.</li>
<li>A negative number after <code>"e"</code> causes the number to be divided by 1 with given zeroes. E.g. <code>123e-6</code> means <code>0.000123</code> (<code>123</code> millionths).</li>
</ul>
<p>For different numeral systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can write numbers directly in hex (<code>0x</code>), octal (<code>0o</code>) and binary (<code>0b</code>) systems.</li>
<li><code>parseInt(str, base)</code> parses the string <code>str</code> into an integer in numeral system with given <code>base</code>, <code>2 ≤ base ≤ 36</code>.</li>
<li><code>num.toString(base)</code> converts a number to a string in the numeral system with the given <code>base</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For converting values like <code>12pt</code> and <code>100px</code> to a number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>parseInt/parseFloat</code> for the “soft” conversion, which reads a number from a string and then returns the value they could read before the error.</li>
</ul>
<p>For fractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round using <code>Math.floor</code>, <code>Math.ceil</code>, <code>Math.trunc</code>, <code>Math.round</code> or <code>num.toFixed(precision)</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure to remember there’s a loss of precision when working with fractions.</li>

</ul>
<p>In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character.</p>
<p>The internal format for strings is always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a>, it is not tied to the page encoding.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>Let’s recall the kinds of quotes.</p>
<p>Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb199"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb199-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> single <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;single-quoted&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb199-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> double <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;double-quoted&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb199-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb199-4" title="4"><span class="kw">let</span> backticks <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`backticks`</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Single and double quotes are essentially the same. Backticks, however, allow us to embed any expression into the string, by wrapping it in <code>${…}</code>:</p>
<p>```js run function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }</p>
<p>alert(<code>1 + 2 = ${sum(1, 2)}.</code>); // 1 + 2 = 3. ```</p>
<p>Another advantage of using backticks is that they allow a string to span multiple lines:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let guestList =</code>Guests: * John * Pete * Mary `;</p>
<p>alert(guestList); // a list of guests, multiple lines ```</p>
<p>Looks natural, right? But single or double quotes do not work this way.</p>
<p>If we use them and try to use multiple lines, there’ll be an error:</p>
<p><code>js run let guestList = "Guests: // Error: Unexpected token ILLEGAL   * John";</code></p>
<p>Single and double quotes come from ancient times of language creation when the need for multiline strings was not taken into account. Backticks appeared much later and thus are more versatile.</p>
<p>Backticks also allow us to specify a “template function” before the first backtick. The syntax is: <code>func`string`</code>. The function <code>func</code> is called automatically, receives the string and embedded expressions and can process them. This is called “tagged templates”. This feature makes it easier to implement custom templating, but is rarely used in practice. You can read more about it in the <a href="mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates">manual</a>.</p>
<h2 id="special-characters">Special characters</h2>
<p>It is still possible to create multiline strings with single and double quotes by using a so-called “newline character”, written as <code>\n</code>, which denotes a line break:</p>
<p>```js run let guestList = “Guests:JohnPeteMary”;</p>
<p>alert(guestList); // a multiline list of guests ```</p>
<p>For example, these two lines are equal, just written differently:</p>
<p>```js run let str1 = “Hello”; // two lines using a “newline symbol”</p>
<p>// two lines using a normal newline and backticks let str2 = <code>Hello World</code>;</p>
<p>alert(str1 == str2); // true ```</p>
<p>There are other, less common “special” characters.</p>
<p>Here’s the full list:</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">

<td>Unicode character with the given hexadecimal Unicode <code>XX</code>, e.g. <code>'\x7A'</code> is the same as <code>'z'</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>\uXXXX</code></td>
<td>A Unicode symbol with the hex code <code>XXXX</code> in UTF-16 encoding, for instance <code>\u00A9</code> – is a Unicode for the copyright symbol <code>©</code>. It must be exactly 4 hex digits.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>\u{X…XXXXXX}</code> (1 to 6 hex characters)</td>
<td>A Unicode symbol with the given UTF-32 encoding. Some rare characters are encoded with two Unicode symbols, taking 4 bytes. This way we can insert long codes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Examples with Unicode:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "\u00A9" ); // © alert( "\u{20331}" ); // 佫, a rare Chinese hieroglyph (long Unicode) alert( "\u{1F60D}" ); // 😍, a smiling face symbol (another long Unicode)</code></p>
<p>All special characters start with a backslash character <code>\</code>. It is also called an “escape character”.</p>
<p>We might also use it if we wanted to insert a quote into the string.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 'I*!*\'*/!*m the Walrus!' ); // *!*I'm*/!* the Walrus!</code></p>
<p>As you can see, we have to prepend the inner quote by the backslash <code>\'</code>, because otherwise it would indicate the string end.</p>
<p>Of course, only the quotes that are the same as the enclosing ones need to be escaped. So, as a more elegant solution, we could switch to double quotes or backticks instead:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( `I'm the Walrus!` ); // I'm the Walrus!</code></p>
<p>Note that the backslash <code>\</code> serves for the correct reading of the string by JavaScript, then disappears. The in-memory string has no <code>\</code>. You can clearly see that in <code>alert</code> from the examples above.</p>
<p>But what if we need to show an actual backslash <code>\</code> within the string?</p>
<p>That’s possible, but we need to double it like <code>\\</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( `The backslash: \\` ); // The backslash: \</code></p>
<h2 id="string-length">String length</h2>
<p>The <code>length</code> property has the string length:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( `My\n`.length ); // 3</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>\n</code> is a single “special” character, so the length is indeed <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>``<code>warn header="</code>length<code>is a property" People with a background in some other languages sometimes mistype by calling</code>str.length()<code>instead of just</code>str.length`. That doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>str.length</code> is a numeric property, not a function. There is no need to add parenthesis after it. ```</p>
<h2 id="accessing-characters">Accessing characters</h2>
<p>To get a character at position <code>pos</code>, use square brackets <code>[pos]</code> or call the method <a href="mdn:js/String/charAt">str.charAt(pos)</a>. The first character starts from the zero position:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let str =</code>Hello`;</p>
<p>// the first character alert( str[0] ); // H alert( str.charAt(0) ); // H</p>
<p>// the last character alert( str[str.length - 1] ); // o ```</p>
<p>The square brackets are a modern way of getting a character, while <code>charAt</code> exists mostly for historical reasons.</p>
<p>The only difference between them is that if no character is found, <code>[]</code> returns <code>undefined</code>, and <code>charAt</code> returns an empty string:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let str =</code>Hello`;</p>
<p>alert( str[1000] ); // undefined alert( str.charAt(1000) ); // ’’ (an empty string) ```</p>
<p>We can also iterate over characters using <code>for..of</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run for (let char of "Hello") {   alert(char); // H,e,l,l,o (char becomes "H", then "e", then "l" etc) }</code></p>
<h2 id="strings-are-immutable">Strings are immutable</h2>
<p>Strings can’t be changed in JavaScript. It is impossible to change a character.</p>
<p>Let’s try it to show that it doesn’t work:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘Hi’;</p>
<p>str[0] = ‘h’; // error alert( str[0] ); // doesn’t work ```</p>
<p>The usual workaround is to create a whole new string and assign it to <code>str</code> instead of the old one.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘Hi’;</p>
<p>str = ‘h’ + str[1]; // replace the string</p>
<p>alert( str ); // hi ```</p>
<p>In the following sections we’ll see more examples of this.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-case">Changing the case</h2>
<p>Methods <a href="mdn:js/String/toLowerCase">toLowerCase()</a> and <a href="mdn:js/String/toUpperCase">toUpperCase()</a> change the case:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 'Interface'.toUpperCase() ); // INTERFACE alert( 'Interface'.toLowerCase() ); // interface</code></p>
<p>Or, if we want a single character lowercased:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb200"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb200-1" title="1"><span class="at">alert</span>( <span class="st">&#39;Interface&#39;</span>[<span class="dv">0</span>].<span class="at">toLowerCase</span>() )<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;i&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="searching-for-a-substring">Searching for a substring</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to look for a substring within a string.</p>
<h3 id="str.indexof">str.indexOf</h3>
<p>The first method is <a href="mdn:js/String/indexOf">str.indexOf(substr, pos)</a>.</p>
<p>It looks for the <code>substr</code> in <code>str</code>, starting from the given position <code>pos</code>, and returns the position where the match was found or <code>-1</code> if nothing can be found.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘Widget with id’;</p>
<p>alert( str.indexOf(‘Widget’) ); // 0, because ‘Widget’ is found at the beginning alert( str.indexOf(‘widget’) ); // -1, not found, the search is case-sensitive</p>
<p>alert( str.indexOf(“id”) ); // 1, “id” is found at the position 1 (..idget with id) ```</p>
<p>The optional second parameter allows us to start searching from a given position.</p>
<p>For instance, the first occurrence of <code>"id"</code> is at position <code>1</code>. To look for the next occurrence, let’s start the search from position <code>2</code>:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘Widget with id’;</p>
<p>alert( str.indexOf(‘id’, 2) ) // 12 ```</p>
<p>If we’re interested in all occurrences, we can run <code>indexOf</code> in a loop. Every new call is made with the position after the previous match:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ‘As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox’;</p>
<p>let target = ‘as’; // let’s look for it</p>
<p>let pos = 0; while (true) { let foundPos = str.indexOf(target, pos); if (foundPos == -1) break;</p>
<p>alert( <code>Found at ${foundPos}</code> ); pos = foundPos + 1; // continue the search from the next position } ```</p>
<p>The same algorithm can be layed out shorter:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox”; let target = “as”;</p>
<p><em>!</em> let pos = -1; while ((pos = str.indexOf(target, pos + 1)) != -1) { alert( pos ); } <em>/!</em> ```</p>
<p>``<code>smart header="</code>str.lastIndexOf(substr, position)`" There is also a similar method <a href="mdn:js/String/lastIndexOf">str.lastIndexOf(substr, position)</a> that searches from the end of a string to its beginning.</p>
<p>It would list the occurrences in the reverse order. ```</p>
<p>There is a slight inconvenience with <code>indexOf</code> in the <code>if</code> test. We can’t put it in the <code>if</code> like this:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Widget with id”;</p>
<p>if (str.indexOf(“Widget”)) { alert(“We found it”); // doesn’t work! } ```</p>
<p>The <code>alert</code> in the example above doesn’t show because <code>str.indexOf("Widget")</code> returns <code>0</code> (meaning that it found the match at the starting position). Right, but <code>if</code> considers <code>0</code> to be <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>So, we should actually check for <code>-1</code>, like this:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Widget with id”;</p>
<p><em>!</em> if (str.indexOf(“Widget”) != -1) { <em>/!</em> alert(“We found it”); // works now! } ```</p>
<h4 id="the-bitwise-not-trick">The bitwise NOT trick</h4>
<p>One of the old tricks used here is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_NOT">bitwise NOT</a> <code>~</code> operator. It converts the number to a 32-bit integer (removes the decimal part if exists) and then reverses all bits in its binary representation.</p>
<p>In practice, that means a simple thing: for 32-bit integers <code>~n</code> equals <code>-(n+1)</code>.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( ~2 ); // -3, the same as -(2+1) alert( ~1 ); // -2, the same as -(1+1) alert( ~0 ); // -1, the same as -(0+1) *!* alert( ~-1 ); // 0, the same as -(-1+1) */!*</code></p>
<p>As we can see, <code>~n</code> is zero only if <code>n == -1</code> (that’s for any 32-bit signed integer <code>n</code>).</p>
<p>So, the test <code>if ( ~str.indexOf("...") )</code> is truthy only if the result of <code>indexOf</code> is not <code>-1</code>. In other words, when there is a match.</p>
<p>People use it to shorten <code>indexOf</code> checks:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “Widget”;</p>
<p>if (~str.indexOf(“Widget”)) { alert( ‘Found it!’ ); // works } ```</p>
<p>It is usually not recommended to use language features in a non-obvious way, but this particular trick is widely used in old code, so we should understand it.</p>
<p>Just remember: <code>if (~str.indexOf(...))</code> reads as “if found”.</p>
<p>To be precise though, as big numbers are truncated to 32 bits by <code>~</code> operator, there exist other numbers that give <code>0</code>, the smallest is <code>~4294967295=0</code>. That makes such check correct only if a string is not that long.</p>
<p>Right now we can see this trick only in the old code, as modern JavaScript provides <code>.includes</code> method (see below).</p>
<h3 id="includes-startswith-endswith">includes, startsWith, endsWith</h3>
<p>The more modern method <a href="mdn:js/String/includes">str.includes(substr, pos)</a> returns <code>true/false</code> depending on whether <code>str</code> contains <code>substr</code> within.</p>
<p>It’s the right choice if we need to test for the match, but don’t need its position:</p>
<p>```js run alert( “Widget with id”.includes(“Widget”) ); // true</p>
<p>alert( “Hello”.includes(“Bye”) ); // false ```</p>
<p>The optional second argument of <code>str.includes</code> is the position to start searching from:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "Widget".includes("id") ); // true alert( "Widget".includes("id", 3) ); // false, from position 3 there is no "id"</code></p>
<p>The methods <a href="mdn:js/String/startsWith">str.startsWith</a> and <a href="mdn:js/String/endsWith">str.endsWith</a> do exactly what they say:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( "Widget".startsWith("Wid") ); // true, "Widget" starts with "Wid" alert( "Widget".endsWith("get") ); // true, "Widget" ends with "get"</code></p>
<h2 id="getting-a-substring">Getting a substring</h2>
<p>There are 3 methods in JavaScript to get a substring: <code>substring</code>, <code>substr</code> and <code>slice</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>str.slice(start [, end])</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the part of the string from <code>start</code> to (but not including) <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run let str = "stringify"; alert( str.slice(0, 5) ); // 'strin', the substring from 0 to 5 (not including 5) alert( str.slice(0, 1) ); // 's', from 0 to 1, but not including 1, so only character at 0</code></p>
<p>If there is no second argument, then <code>slice</code> goes till the end of the string:</p>
<p><code>js run let str = "st*!*ringify*/!*"; alert( str.slice(2) ); // 'ringify', from the 2nd position till the end</code></p>
<p>Negative values for <code>start/end</code> are also possible. They mean the position is counted from the string end:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “strin<em>!</em>gif<em>/!</em>y”;</p>
<p>// start at the 4th position from the right, end at the 1st from the right alert( str.slice(-4, -1) ); // ‘gif’ ```</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>str.substring(start [, end])</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the part of the string <em>between</em> <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>This is almost the same as <code>slice</code>, but it allows <code>start</code> to be greater than <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>```js run let str = “st<em>!</em>ring<em>/!</em>ify”;</p>
<p>// these are same for substring alert( str.substring(2, 6) ); // “ring” alert( str.substring(6, 2) ); // “ring”</p>
<p>// …but not for slice: alert( str.slice(2, 6) ); // “ring” (the same) alert( str.slice(6, 2) ); // "" (an empty string)</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Negative arguments are (unlike slice) not supported, they are treated as <code>0</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>str.substr(start [, length])</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the part of the string from <code>start</code>, with the given <code>length</code>.</p>
<p>In contrast with the previous methods, this one allows us to specify the <code>length</code> instead of the ending position:</p>
<p><code>js run let str = "st*!*ring*/!*ify"; alert( str.substr(2, 4) ); // 'ring', from the 2nd position get 4 characters</code></p>
<p>The first argument may be negative, to count from the end:</p>
<p><code>js run let str = "strin*!*gi*/!*fy"; alert( str.substr(-4, 2) ); // 'gi', from the 4th position get 2 characters</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let’s recap these methods to avoid any confusion:</p>
<table>

<p>``<code>smart header="Which one to choose?" All of them can do the job. Formally,</code>substr` has a minor drawback: it is described not in the core JavaScript specification, but in Annex B, which covers browser-only features that exist mainly for historical reasons. So, non-browser environments may fail to support it. But in practice it works everywhere.</p>
<p>Of the other two variants, <code>slice</code> is a little bit more flexible, it allows negative arguments and shorter to write. So, it’s enough to remember solely <code>slice</code> of these three methods. ```</p>
<h2 id="comparing-strings">Comparing strings</h2>
<p>As we know from the chapter <a href="info:comparison" class="uri">info:comparison</a>, strings are compared character-by-character in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Although, there are some oddities.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A lowercase letter is always greater than the uppercase:</p>
<p><code>js run  alert( 'a' &gt; 'Z' ); // true</code></p></li>
<li><p>Letters with diacritical marks are “out of order”:</p>
<p><code>js run  alert( 'Österreich' &gt; 'Zealand' ); // true</code></p>
<p>This may lead to strange results if we sort these country names. Usually people would expect <code>Zealand</code> to come after <code>Österreich</code> in the list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To understand what happens, let’s review the internal representation of strings in JavaScript.</p>
<p>All strings are encoded using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a>. That is: each character has a corresponding numeric code. There are special methods that allow to get the character for the code and back.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>str.codePointAt(pos)</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the code for the character at position <code>pos</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run // different case letters have different codes alert( "z".codePointAt(0) ); // 122 alert( "Z".codePointAt(0) ); // 90</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>String.fromCodePoint(code)</code></dt>
<dd><p>Creates a character by its numeric <code>code</code></p>
<p><code>js run alert( String.fromCodePoint(90) ); // Z</code></p>
<p>We can also add Unicode characters by their codes using <code>\u</code> followed by the hex code:</p>
<p><code>js run // 90 is 5a in hexadecimal system alert( '\u005a' ); // Z</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now let’s see the characters with codes <code>65..220</code> (the latin alphabet and a little bit extra) by making a string of them:</p>
<p>```js run let str = ’’;</p>
<p>for (let i = 65; i &lt;= 220; i++) { str += String.fromCodePoint(i); } alert( str ); // ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ // ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬­®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜ ```</p>
<p>See? Capital characters go first, then a few special ones, then lowercase characters, and <code>Ö</code> near the end of the output.</p>
<p>Now it becomes obvious why <code>a &gt; Z</code>.</p>
<p>The characters are compared by their numeric code. The greater code means that the character is greater. The code for <code>a</code> (97) is greater than the code for <code>Z</code> (90).</p>
<ul>
<li>All lowercase letters go after uppercase letters because their codes are greater.</li>
<li>Some letters like <code>Ö</code> stand apart from the main alphabet. Here, it’s code is greater than anything from <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="correct-comparisons-correct-comparisons">Correct comparisons [#correct-comparisons]</h3>
<p>The “right” algorithm to do string comparisons is more complex than it may seem, because alphabets are different for different languages.</p>
<p>So, the browser needs to know the language to compare.</p>
<p>Luckily, all modern browsers (IE10- requires the additional library <a href="https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/">Intl.js</a>) support the internationalization standard <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/ECMA-402.pdf">ECMA-402</a>.</p>
<p>It provides a special method to compare strings in different languages, following their rules.</p>
<p>The call <a href="mdn:js/String/localeCompare">str.localeCompare(str2)</a> returns an integer indicating whether <code>str</code> is less, equal or greater than <code>str2</code> according to the language rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returns a negative number if <code>str</code> is less than <code>str2</code>.</li>
<li>Returns a positive number if <code>str</code> is greater than <code>str2</code>.</li>
<li>Returns <code>0</code> if they are equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 'Österreich'.localeCompare('Zealand') ); // -1</code></p>
<p>This method actually has two additional arguments specified in <a href="mdn:js/String/localeCompare">the documentation</a>, which allows it to specify the language (by default taken from the environment, letter order depends on the language) and setup additional rules like case sensitivity or should <code>"a"</code> and <code>"á"</code> be treated as the same etc.</p>
<h2 id="internals-unicode">Internals, Unicode</h2>
<p>```warn header=“Advanced knowledge” The section goes deeper into string internals. This knowledge will be useful for you if you plan to deal with emoji, rare mathematical or hieroglyphic characters or other rare symbols.</p>
<p>You can skip the section if you don’t plan to support them. ```</p>
<h3 id="surrogate-pairs">Surrogate pairs</h3>
<p>All frequently used characters have 2-byte codes. Letters in most european languages, numbers, and even most hieroglyphs, have a 2-byte representation.</p>
<p>But 2 bytes only allow 65536 combinations and that’s not enough for every possible symbol. So rare symbols are encoded with a pair of 2-byte characters called “a surrogate pair”.</p>
<p>The length of such symbols is <code>2</code>:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( '𝒳'.length ); // 2, MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL X alert( '😂'.length ); // 2, FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY alert( '𩷶'.length ); // 2, a rare Chinese hieroglyph</code></p>
<p>Note that surrogate pairs did not exist at the time when JavaScript was created, and thus are not correctly processed by the language!</p>
<p>We actually have a single symbol in each of the strings above, but the <code>length</code> shows a length of <code>2</code>.</p>
<p><code>String.fromCodePoint</code> and <code>str.codePointAt</code> are few rare methods that deal with surrogate pairs right. They recently appeared in the language. Before them, there were only <a href="mdn:js/String/fromCharCode">String.fromCharCode</a> and <a href="mdn:js/String/charCodeAt">str.charCodeAt</a>. These methods are actually the same as <code>fromCodePoint/codePointAt</code>, but don’t work with surrogate pairs.</p>
<p>Getting a symbol can be tricky, because surrogate pairs are treated as two characters:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( '𝒳'[0] ); // strange symbols... alert( '𝒳'[1] ); // ...pieces of the surrogate pair</code></p>
<p>Note that pieces of the surrogate pair have no meaning without each other. So the alerts in the example above actually display garbage.</p>
<p>Technically, surrogate pairs are also detectable by their codes: if a character has the code in the interval of <code>0xd800..0xdbff</code>, then it is the first part of the surrogate pair. The next character (second part) must have the code in interval <code>0xdc00..0xdfff</code>. These intervals are reserved exclusively for surrogate pairs by the standard.</p>
<p>In the case above:</p>
<p>```js run // charCodeAt is not surrogate-pair aware, so it gives codes for parts</p>
<p>alert( ‘𝒳’.charCodeAt(0).toString(16) ); // d835, between 0xd800 and 0xdbff alert( ‘𝒳’.charCodeAt(1).toString(16) ); // dcb3, between 0xdc00 and 0xdfff ```</p>
<p>You will find more ways to deal with surrogate pairs later in the chapter <a href="info:iterable" class="uri">info:iterable</a>. There are probably special libraries for that too, but nothing famous enough to suggest here.</p>
<h3 id="diacritical-marks-and-normalization">Diacritical marks and normalization</h3>
<p>In many languages there are symbols that are composed of the base character with a mark above/under it.</p>
<p>For instance, the letter <code>a</code> can be the base character for: <code>àáâäãåā</code>. Most common “composite” character have their own code in the UTF-16 table. But not all of them, because there are too many possible combinations.</p>
<p>To support arbitrary compositions, UTF-16 allows us to use several Unicode characters: the base character followed by one or many “mark” characters that “decorate” it.</p>
<p>For instance, if we have <code>S</code> followed by the special “dot above” character (code <code>\u0307</code>), it is shown as Ṡ.</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 'S\u0307' ); // Ṡ</code></p>
<p>If we need an additional mark above the letter (or below it) – no problem, just add the necessary mark character.</p>
<p>For instance, if we append a character “dot below” (code <code>\u0323</code>), then we’ll have “S with dots above and below”: <code>Ṩ</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>js run alert( 'S\u0307\u0323' ); // Ṩ</code></p>
<p>This provides great flexibility, but also an interesting problem: two characters may visually look the same, but be represented with different Unicode compositions.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
```js run let s1 = ’S
