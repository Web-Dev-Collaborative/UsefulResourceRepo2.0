<body>
<p>There are 11 interview questions, each scored on a 1 to 3 rubric. A passing score consists of scoring 22 out of 33 (or 66%).</p>
<p>The interview is meant to mimic an actual interview! It will last approximately 1 hour. Make sure you treat this interview like you would any job interview. Show up on time, with your video on, in a quiet place and with a professional Zoom background.</p>
<p>The interview will be a review of your web skillset and knowledge. Please come prepared with GitHub links to your build week unit 3 project and unit 4 sprint challenges 1 and 2. <strong>Your projects do not need to be 100% complete or bug free.</strong> You will not be scored on your code but it will be a starting point for discussion. You may also use links to personal projects if you prefer. Questions will relate to the following topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Responsive Design Concepts</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Basic and Applied JavaScript</li>
<li>Single Page Apps</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Node</li>
<li>RDMS</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Results</strong></p>
<p>The interviewer will score your performance according to objectives that correspond with the core Web curriculum. You will receive your score in your Sprint 3 canvas course on the interview assignment. Click the assignment to view your feedback and score on each objective.</p>
<p>A passing score consists of scoring a two or higher across all objectives.<br />
Receiving a one on any objective(s) will be considered not passing.</p>
