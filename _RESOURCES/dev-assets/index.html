packages, so type sudo apt update (if prompted for your password, enter it) You
need to upgrade your packages, so type sudo apt upgrade (if prompted for your

However, you should configure it using the following instructions. ‌Open an
Ubuntu terminal if you don’t have one open already. You need to configure Git,
so type git config --global user.name "Your Name" with replacing "Your Name"
with your real name. You need to configure Git, so type git config --global
user.email your@email.com with replacing "your@email.com" with your real email.
Note: if you want git to remember your login credentials type: $ git config
--global credential.helper store ‌ Google Chrome Test if you have Chrome
installed by typing “Chrome” in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads

type in http://chrome.google.com. Click the “Download Chrome” button. Click the
“Accept and Install” button after reading the terms of service. Click “Save” in

it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux
unzip utility. ‌In the Ubuntu terminal type: sudo apt install unzip and press
Enter ‌Mocha.js Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu
terminal and typing which mocha. If it prints a path, then you're good.
Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing npm install -g

command sudo apt install python3. Test it by typing python3 --version and seeing
it print a number. ‌ Note about WSL ‌ As of the time of writing of this
document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is
open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you
close Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal. ‌
