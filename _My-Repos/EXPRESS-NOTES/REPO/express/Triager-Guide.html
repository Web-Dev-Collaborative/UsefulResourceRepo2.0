    <p>
      When a new issue or pull request is opened the issue will be labeled with
      <code>needs triage</code>. If a triage team member is available they can
      help make sure all the required information is provided. Depending on the
      issue or PR there are several next labels they can add for further
      classification:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>needs triage</code>: This can be kept if the triager is unsure
        which next steps to take
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>awaiting more info</code>: If more info has been requested from
        the author, apply this label.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>question</code>: User questions that do not appear to be bugs or
        enhancements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>discuss</code>: Topics for discussion. Might end in an
        <code>enhancement</code> or <code>question</code> label.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>bug</code>: Issues that present a reasonable conviction there is a
        reproducible bug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>enhancement</code>: Issues that are found to be a reasonable
        candidate feature additions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all cases, issues may be closed by maintainers if they don’t receive a
      timely response when further information is sought, or when additional
      questions are asked.

      Approaches and Best Practices for getting into triage contributions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Review the organization’s
      <a href="https://expressjs.github.io/statusboard/">StatusBoard</a>, pay
      special attention to these columns: stars, watchers, open issues, and
      contributors. This gives you a general idea about the criticality and
      health of the repository. Pick a few projects based on that criteria, your
      interests, and skills (existing or aspiring).
    </p>
    <p>
      Review the project’s contribution guideline if present. In a nutshell,
      commit to the community’s standards and values. Review the documentation,
      for most of the projects it is just the README.md, and make sure you
      understand the key APIs, semantics, configurations, and use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be helpful to write your own test apps to re-affirm your
      understanding of the key functions. This may identify some gaps in
      documentation, record those as they might be good PR’s to open. Skim
      through the issue backlog; identify low hanging issues and mostly new
      ones. From those, attempt to recreate issues based on the OP description
      and ask questions if required. No question is a bad question!
    </p>
    <h2 id="removal-of-triage-role">Removal of Triage Role</h2>
    <p>There are a few cases where members can be removed as triagers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breaking the CoC or project contributor guidelines</li>
      <li>Abuse or misuse of the role as deemed by the TC</li>
      <li>Lack of participation for more than 6 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If any of these happen we will discuss as a part of the triage portion of
      the regular TC meetings. If you have questions feel free to reach out to
      any of the TC members.
    </p>
    <h2 id="other-helpful-hints">Other Helpful Hints:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Everyone is welcome to attend the
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/discussions#expressjs-tc-meetings"
          >Express Technical Committee Meetings</a
        >, and as a triager, it might help to get a better idea of what’s
        happening with the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        When exploring the module’s functionality there are a few helpful steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Turn on <code>DEBUG=*</code> (see
            https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to get detailed log information
          </li>
          <li>
            It is also a good idea to do live debugging to follow the control
            flow, try using <code>node --inspect</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a good idea to make at least one pass of reading through the
            entire source
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When reviewing the list of open issues there are some common types and
        suggested actions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            New/unattended issues or simple questions: A good place to start
          </li>
          <li>
            Hard bugs &amp; ongoing discussions: always feel free to chime in
            and help
          </li>
          <li>
            Issues that imply gaps in the documentation: open PRs with changes
            or help the user to do so
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For recurring issues, it is helpful to create functional examples to
        demonstrate (publish as gists or a repo)
      </li>
      <li>
        Review and identify the maintainers. If necessary, at-mention one or
        more of them if you are unsure what to do
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure all your interactions are professional, welcoming, and
        respectful to the parties involved.
      </li>
