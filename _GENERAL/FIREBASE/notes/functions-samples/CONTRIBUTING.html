    <p>
      We’d love for you to contribute to our source code and to make the
      Firebase Cloud Functions Templates Library even better than it is today!
      Here are the guidelines we’d like you to follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#coc">Code of Conduct</a></li>
      <li><a href="#question">Question or Problem?</a></li>

    <h2 id="code-of-conduct"><a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      As contributors and maintainers of the Firebase functions-samples project,
      we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating
      documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments,
      and any other activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication through any of Firebase’s channels (GitHub, StackOverflow,
      Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks,
      trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this
      project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
      disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We
      expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the
      maintainers of this project may take action, removing issues, comments,
      and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
    </p>

      concerns, please drop us a line at

    <h2 id="found-an-issue"><a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?</h2>
    <p>
      If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation,
      you can help us by submitting an issue to our
      <a href="https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples"
        >GitHub Repository</a
      >. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
    </p>
    <p>See <a href="#submit">below</a> for some guidelines.</p>
    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">
      <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines
    </h2>
    <h3 id="submitting-an-issue">Submitting an Issue</h3>
    <p>
      Before you submit your issue search the archive in case your question was
      already answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
      features by not reporting duplicate issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more information you can provide in an issue, the faster we can
      resolve it. Issues that don’t make an attempt to follow the issue template
      will likely be closed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="new-samples">New samples</h3>
    <p>
      Given the maintenance cost of the large number of samples that are already
      in this repository, we are unlikely to add new samples. However, if you
      have an idea for a sample and would like to discuss it with others, take a
      look at the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas"
        >“ideas” section of this repository’s discussions</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull Requests that contain new samples will only be considered if they
      meet the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Solve a common use-case for Cloud Functions for Firebase with minimal
        non-Firebase setup required
      </li>
      <li>Thoroughly documented</li>
      <li>Thoroughly tested</li>
      <li>
        Simple enough to be maintained alongside all other samples in the
        repository
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your Pull Request isn’t accepted, consider hosting it in your own
      GitHub repository, and adding it to our
      <a href="./community.md">list of community-built extensions</a>!
    </p>
    <h2 id="signing-the-cla"><a name="cla"></a> Signing the CLA</h2>
    <p>
      Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
      Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
      contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
      contributions as part of the project. Head over to
      <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/" class="uri"
        >https://cla.developers.google.com/</a
      >
      to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you’ve already
      submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don’t
      need to do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please sign our
      <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com"

      the CLA must be signed. It’s a quick process, we promise!
