    <p>
      Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or
      framework, including React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. Although
      Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using Redux with any kind of UI framework, you will normally
      use a “UI binding” library to tie Redux together with your UI framework,
      rather than directly interacting with the store from your UI code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >React Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React</strong
      >. If you are using Redux and React together, you should also use React
      Redux to bind these two libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand why you should use React Redux, it may help to understand
      what a “UI binding library” does.

    <ol type="1">
      <li>Create a Redux store</li>

    </ol>

      complicated logic.

      The process of subscribing to the store, checking for updated data, and
      triggering a re-render can be made more generic and reusable.

      While Redux can be used with any UI layer, it was originally designed and
      intended for use with React. There are
      <a
        href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem#library-integration-and-bindings"
        >UI binding layers for many other frameworks</a
      >, but React Redux is maintained directly by the Redux team.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the offical Redux binding for React, React Redux is kept up-to-date
      with any API changes from either library, to ensure that your React
      components behave as expected. Its intended usage adopts the design
      principles of React - writing declarative components.
    </p>
    <h3 id="it-encourages-good-react-architecture">
      It Encourages Good React Architecture
    </h3>
    <p>
      React components are a lot like functions. While it’s possible to write
      all your code in a single function, it’s usually better to split that
      logic into smaller functions that each handle a specific task, making them
      easier to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, while you can write large React components that handle many
      different tasks, it’s usually better to split up components based on
      responsibilities. In particular, it is common to have “container”
      components that are responsible for collecting and managing some kind of
      data, and “presentational” components that simply display UI based on
      whatever data they’ve received as props.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The React Redux <code>connect</code> function generates “container”
        wrapper components that handle the process of interacting with the store
        for you</strong
      >. That way, your own components can focus on other tasks, whether it be
      collecting other data, or just displaying a piece of the UI. In addition,
      <strong
        ><code>connect</code> abstracts away the question of
        <em>which</em> store is being used, making your own components more
        reusable</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general architectural principle,
      <strong>we want to keep our own components “unaware” of Redux</strong>.
      They should simply receive data and functions as props, just like any
      other React component. This ultimately makes it easier to test and reuse
      your own components.
    </p>
    <h3 id="it-implements-performance-optimizations-for-you">
      It Implements Performance Optimizations For You
    </h3>
    <p>
      React is generally fast, but by default any updates to a component will
      cause React to re-render all of the components inside that part of the
      component tree. This does require work, and if the data for a given
      component hasn’t changed, then re-rendering is likely some wasted effort
      because the requested UI output would be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      If performance is a concern, the best way to improve performance is to
      skip unnecessary re-renders, so that components only re-render when their
      data has actually changed.
      <strong
        >React Redux implements many performance optimizations internally, so
        that your own component only re-renders when it actually needs
        to.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, by connecting multiple components in your React component
      tree, you can ensure that each connected component only extracts the
      specific pieces of data from the store state that are needed by that
      component. This means that your own component will need to re-render less
      often, because most of the time those specific pieces of data haven’t
      changed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="community-support">Community Support</h3>
    <p>
      As the official binding library for React and Redux, React Redux has a
      large community of users. This makes it easier to ask for help, learn
      about best practices, use libraries that build on top of React Redux, and
      reuse your knowledge across different applications.
