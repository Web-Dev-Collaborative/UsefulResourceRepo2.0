<h2 id="what-are-components">What are Components?</h2>
<p>React Components are the building blocks of a React view-layer. They are Javascript functions that return HTML to be rendered onto a document. Because they are typically written in JSX, components often look like HTML dropped into a Javascript file.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example">A Simple Example</h2>
<p>Download <a href="https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/react/demos/simple_component.zip">this example</a> in another tab and read along below.</p>
<h4 id="index.html">index.html</h4>
<p>Start by opening <code>index.html</code>. It’s a normal HTML document that contains a <code>&lt;div id='root'/&gt;</code>. This <code>#root</code> element will serve as the <em>hook</em> into which we insert our React component.</p>
<h4 id="index.jsx">index.jsx</h4>
<p>Now, take a look at <code>index.jsx</code>. Note the use of <code>React.Component</code> and <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>. <code>SimpleComponent</code> is defined as a JS class that inherits from <code>React.Component</code>. The resulting React component is then passed to <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>, which inserts it into the DOM inside <code>root</code>, the <code>#root</code> element we created in <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Both <code>React.Component</code> and <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> contain JSX syntax (the parts that look like HTML). Remember, these expressions represent Javascript functions that ultimately render HTML onto a document.</p>
<h4 id="package.json">package.json</h4>
<p>The demo also contains a <code>package.json</code> file, which is used to configure NPM and lists all of an app’s JS dependencies, similar to a Ruby <code>Gemfile</code>. You’ll read more about this later.</p>
<h4 id="webpack.config.js">webpack.config.js</h4>
<p>The demo also contains a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, which configures Webpack. Note that the output file, <code>bundle.js</code>, is sourced in our <code>index.html</code> and represents all of our app’s code, along with its dependencies (<code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>). Webpack is also responsible for transpiling our JSX into raw Javascript for the browser. More on this later, too.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>In order to create React components, you will need to require the <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> packages from <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/npm"><code>npm</code></a>.</p>
