<h2 id="what-is-mongodb">What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that is scalable and flexible. In order to understand what this means, we will break down the above sentence in the sections below.</p>
<h3 id="document-based">Document-based</h3>
<p>MongoDB stores data using a document data structure. <strong>Documents</strong> are JSON-like objects with key-value pairs. Documents with similar data are stored within <strong>collections</strong>. To compare it to a relational database, a document is similar to a row while a collection is similar to a table.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example of a <code>user</code> document.</p>
<pre><code>    {
        _id: ObjectId(&quot;5d8d5b50a5b9d4a3c402f571&quot;),
        username: &quot;i_love_walking&quot;,
        email: &quot;walker@walkingisgreat.com&quot;,
        password_digest: &quot;Ke&amp;63h1z$mK9jd37n&quot;,
        age: 28,
        address: {
            city: &quot;Generic City Name&quot;,
            street: &quot;Somewhere Lane&quot;,
            zipcode: 1
        },
        posts: [
            ObjectId(&quot;4a1h3m42a5b9d4i9dc405l721&quot;),
            ObjectId(&quot;b9x2m45a5b7h7e3ml403a091&quot;),
            ObjectId(&quot;1k3b5f87x5s6c7i2mp814g524&quot;)
        ]
    }</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed the several different datatypes being stored in the document above. This is one of the benefits of using this document data-structure. We are able to store not only arrays, but sub-documents as well. The sub-document in this example is the value of the address key.</p>
<h4 id="embedding">Embedding</h4>
<p>Storing sub-documents within a document is know as <strong>embedding</strong>. Embedding related information provides better read performance, as well as the ability to retrieve related data with a single database query. Additionally, embedded data models make it possible to update related data in a single operation.</p>
<p>You should use an embedded data model when you are trying to model the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-to-One relationships</li>
<li>Small One-to-Many relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>important</strong> thing to keep in mind is that MongoDB documents have a size limit of 16 megabytes. This essentially means that there is a limit to how much you can embed within a document. A good rule of thumb is if you are expecting to embed 50 or more sub-documents within a document then you should break those sub-documents out into their own collection. You can then utilize <strong>referencing</strong> to model their relationships.</p>
<h4 id="referencing">Referencing</h4>
<p>You may have also noticed in the example <code>user</code> document, there are several ObjectIds stored within the posts array. These ObjectIds hold a reference to a document in a separate collection. This pattern is known as <strong>referencing</strong>.</p>
<p>Referencing will seem very familiar after working with a relational database. However, the benefits of embedding are lost when we use referencing. Despite this, here are a few situations where we might need to use referencing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many-to-Many relationships</li>
<li>Modeling large hierarchical data sets</li>
<li>Large One-to-Many relationships</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nosql">NoSQL</h3>
<p>NoSQL databases are non-relational databases, and one of the best ways to understand them is to compare them to relational databases. We will break down a few of the differences in this section.</p>
<p>First, the most basic way that SQL and NoSQL databases differ is in how they store data. SQL databases store data in tables where each row may represent an object. NoSQL databases can store data in several different ways other than tables. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Graphs</li>
<li>Key-value pairs</li>
<li>Wide-column stores</li>
</ul>
<p>MongoDB, as mentioned in the previous section, stores data using a document data structure.</p>
<p>Second, SQL databases require a strict, predefined schema before you are able to start adding data to it. NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema, meaning you don't need to have the schema completely defined before adding data to the database.</p>
<p>Third, SQL databases follow ACID properties while NoSQL databases tend to follow the Brewer's CAP theorem. These acronyms are summarized below, however we would recommend reading up on them further.</p>
<p>ACID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity
<ul>
<li>All components of a transaction are treated as a single action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consistency
<ul>
<li>All transactions must follow the defined rules of the database, such as constraints.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Isolation
<ul>
<li>Concurrently executed transactions result in the same database state as if they were sequentially executed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Durability
<ul>
<li>Once a transaction is committed, it will persist and cannot be undone by something like a system failure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>CAP theorem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency
<ul>
<li>All duplicates of the same data will be the same value across a distributed system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Availability
<ul>
<li>All nodes within a system can process operations and respond to queries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Partition tolerance
<ul>
<li>The system continues to operate despite any unplanned network connectivity loss between nodes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that according to the CAP theorem, in the case of a network partition, one must choose between consistency and availability. Specifically, MongoDB chooses to keep consistency over availability by not accepting writes to a system until it believes it can safely do so.</p>
<p>Finally, SQL databases are centralized databases, while NoSQL databases are distributed databases. A centralized database is one that is stored in a single location. A distributed database is a collection of multiple, logically interrelated databases.</p>
<h3 id="scalable">Scalable</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, NoSQL databases are distributed databases. This makes them able to be scaled horizontally by just adding more machines to your pool of resources.</p>
<p>In contrast, centralized databases are vertically scalable. You would have to add more power (CPU, RAM) to the single machine that the database is being held on.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, it is much cheaper and accessible to add additional machines to a pool than it is to upgrade one machine.</p>
<h3 id="flexible">Flexible</h3>
<p>MongoDB's flexibility comes primarily from its utilization dynamic schemas as well as the document data structure.</p>
<p>A dynamic schema allows you to start with a basic schema that can be updated easily. This has been important to more modern apps and companies, because it aids their teams in building a base app quickly and adapting it as needed.</p>
<p>Recall that the document data structure is JSON-like. It is able to store a variety of different data types, but more importantly, it can be directly interfaced within our backend code. You no longer need to use an ORM (e.g. Active Record) to map data from a database to an object that you can easily interface with. This speeds up the development process as you have one less thing to worry about.</p>
