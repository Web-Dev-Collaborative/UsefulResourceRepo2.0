<h1 id="timers">Timers</h1>
<p>We have the following code to show a log in the console after 1000 ms / 1 sec.</p>
<pre><code>var check = false;
var timeStart = new Date().getTime();

setTimeout( function () {
    check = true;
}, 1000 );

while( !check ){
}

console.log( &#39;Loop has finished&#39;, &#39;Elapsed time:&#39; + (new Date().getTime() - timeStart) );</code></pre>
<p>But for some weird reason it doesnâ€™t works as expected and blocks the browser, could you help us?</p>
