<p>Python has several different versions and a number of ways it can be set up on each operating system. This section will help you install Python if the simple approach in Chapter 1 didn’t work, or if you want to install a different version of Python than the one that came with your system.</p>

<h2 id="python-on-linux">Python on Linux</h2>
<p>Python is included by default on almost every Linux system, but you might want to use a different version than the default. If so, first find out which version of Python you already have installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ python --version
Python 2.7.6</code></pre>
<p>This shows that the default version is Python 2.7.6. However, you might have a version of Python 3 installed as well. To check, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.0</code></pre>
<p>Python 3.5.0 is also installed. It’s worth running both commands before you attempt to install a new version.</p>
<p>###Installing Python 3 on Linux</p>
<p>If you don’t have Python 3 or if you want to install a newer version of Python 3, you can use a package called <code>deadsnakes</code>, which makes it easy to install multiple versions of Python:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.5</code></pre>
<p>These commands will install Python 3.5 to your system. The following command will start a terminal session running Python 3.5:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3.5
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You’ll also use this command when you configure your text editor to use Python 3, and when you run programs from a terminal.</p>

<h2 id="python-on-os-x">Python on OS X</h2>
<p>Python is already installed on most OS X systems, but you might want to use a different version than what’s installed by default. First, find out which version of Python you already have installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ python --version
Python 2.7.6</code></pre>
<p>This shows that the default version is Python 2.7.6. However, you might have a version of Python 3 installed as well. To check, issue the command <strong>python3 –version</strong>. You’ll probably get an error message, but it’s worth checking to see if the version you want is already installed.</p>
<p>###Installing Homebrew</p>
<p>If you only have Python 2 installed, or if you have an older version of Python 3, you can install the latest version of Python 3 using a package called Homebrew.</p>
<p>Homebrew depends on Apple’s Xcode package, so open a terminal and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ xcode-select --install</code></pre>
<p>Click through the confirmation dialogs that pop up. Next, install Homebrew with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you include a space between <code>curl -fsSL</code> and the URL. The <code>-e</code> in this command tells Ruby (the programming language Homebrew is written in) to execute the code that’s downloaded here. You should only run commands like this from sources you trust.</p>
<p>To confirm that Homebrew was installed correctly, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.</code></pre>
<p>This output means you’re ready to install Python packages through Homebrew.</p>
<p>###Installing Python 3</p>
<p>To install the latest version of Python 3, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ brew install python3</code></pre>
<p>You can check which version was installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.0
$</code></pre>
<p>Now you can start a Python 3 terminal session using the command <code>python3</code>, and you can ues the <code>python3</code> command to configure your text editor so it runs Python programs with Python 3 instead of Python 2.</p>

<h2 id="python-on-windows">Python on Windows</h2>
<p>Python isn’t usually included by default on Windows, but it’s worth checking to see if it exists on your system. Open a command window and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python --version
Python 3.5.0</code></pre>
<p>If you see output like this, Python is already installed, but you might want to install a newer version if your version is not up to date. If you see an error message, you’ll need to download and install Python.</p>
<p>###Installing Python 3 on Windows</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://python.org/downloads/">http://python.org/downloads/</a> and click the version of Python you want. Download the installer, and when you run it make sure to check the <em>Add Python to PATH</em> option. This will let you use the <code>python</code> command instead of having to enter your system’s full path to python, and you won’t have to modify your system’s environment variables manually. After you’ve installed Python, issue the <code>python --version</code> command in a new terminal window. If it works, you’re done.</p>
<p>###Finding the Python interpreter</p>
<p>If you’ve installed Python and the simple command <code>python</code> doesn’t work, you’ll need to tell Windows where to find the Python interpreter. To find it, open your C drive and find the folder with a name starting with <em>Python</em> (you might need to enter the word <code>python</code> in the Windows Explorer search bar to find the right folder). Open the folder, and look for a file with the lowercase name <em>python</em>. Right-click this file and choose <strong>Properties</strong>; you’ll see the path to this file under the heading <em>Location</em>.</p>
<p>In the terminal window, use the path to confirm the version you just installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ C:\\Python35\python --version
Python 3.5.0</code></pre>
<p>###Adding Python to your Path variable</p>
<p>It’s annoying to type the full path each time you want to start a Python terminal session. If you add the path to the system you can just use the command <code>python</code>. (If you already check the <em>Add Python to PATH</em> box when installing, you can skip this step.)</p>
<p>Open your system’s <strong>Control Panel</strong>, choose <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then choose <strong>System</strong>. Click <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>. In the window that pops up, click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>. In the box labeled <em>System variables</em>, look for a variable called <code>Path</code>. click <strong>Edit</strong>. In the box that pops up, click in the box labeled <em>Variable value</em> and use the right arrow key to scroll all the way to the right. Be careful not to overwrite the existing variable; if you do, click Cancel and try again. Add a semicolon and the path to your <em>python.exe</em> file to the existing variable:</p>
<pre><code>%SystemRoot%\system32\...\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Python35</code></pre>
<p>Close your terminal window and open a new one. This will load the new <code>Path</code> variable into your terminal session. Now when you enter <code>python --version</code>, you should see the version of Python you just set in your <code>Path</code> variable. You can now start a Python terminal sesion by just entering <code>python</code> at a command prompt.</p>
