<h1 id="javascript---i">JavaScript - I</h1>
<ul>
<li>The point of these assignments is to take your knowledge of JavaScript and start putting into practice the principles learned throughout JavaScript I.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-up-the-project-with-git">Set Up The Project With Git</h2>
<p><strong>Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.</li>
<li>[ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.</li>
<li>[ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda’s by mistake!).</li>
<li>[ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Implement the project on your newly created <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code> branch, committing changes regularly.</li>
<li>[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow these steps for completing your project.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student’s Repo). <strong>Please don’t merge your own pull request</strong></li>
<li>[ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request</li>
<li>[ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-description">Assignment Description</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.</li>
<li>Use <code>console.log()</code> statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.</li>
<li>To test your <code>console.log()</code> statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>You could also run <code>node /assignments/&lt;fileName&gt;</code> and see what prints in your terminal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
<p>To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The <a href="assignments/objects.js">objects.js</a> file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills to answer vital questions for HR.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges</li>
<li>Don’t work on stretch until you have completed all assignments</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>The <a href="assignments/arrays.js">arrays.js</a> assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars. You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory. Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize the the array <code>inventory</code> to complete your challenges</li>
<li>Use any array method you see fit to solve the problem</li>
<li>Don’t work on stretch until you have completed all assignments</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arrow-function-syntax">Arrow Function Syntax</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Arrow Function Syntax - <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26">Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax</a>. You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the <a href="assignments/function-conversion.js">function-conversion.js</a> file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stretch">Stretch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move on to tomorrow’s content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.</li>
<li>Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.</li>
</ul>
