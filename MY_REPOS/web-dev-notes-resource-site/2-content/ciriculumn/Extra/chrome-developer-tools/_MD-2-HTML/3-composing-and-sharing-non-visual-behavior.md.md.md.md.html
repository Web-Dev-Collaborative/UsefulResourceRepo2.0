<h2 id="custom-hooks">Custom Hooks ü§†</h2>
<p>We all love the convenient interface of React Hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. We‚Äôll also be working with <code>useReducer</code> quite a bit later on in this unit. But did you realize you can also create your own hooks?</p>
<p>Sometimes when you‚Äôre building an app, you‚Äôll come up with a clever implementation that is helpful in a lot of different contexts rather than just in the component you‚Äôre working on at the moment! You can actually just write your own hook to extend the functionality of the hooks built into React. Just like a helper function you‚Äôd write to share some functionality across your app, but with React flavor.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit complicated, but it‚Äôs actually super easy in practice. From the React docs: &gt; A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ‚Äùuse‚Äù and that may call other Hooks.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of real custom hooks you‚Äôll see in the wild: * useLocalStorage: just like useState, but persist the values to localStorage in case a session is interrupted (we‚Äôll build a version of this today) * useHistory and useParams: nice custom hooks included in React Router for accessing url params and browser history * useSpeechSynthesis: easy text-to-sound synthesis for your React app (part of <code>react-speech-kit</code>)</p>
<h2 id="stateful-logic-and-non-visual-behavior">Stateful logic and non-visual behavior üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
<p>When we talk about ‚Äústateful logic‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-visual behavior‚Äù in React, we‚Äôre simply referring to all of the logic in a component other than the basics. These are all part of the ‚Äústateful logic‚Äù in a component: * Updating state * Handling form inputs * Responding to events</p>
<p>Rendering something to the DOM is an example of basic behavior that is <em>not</em> considered ‚Äústateful logic‚Äù. We can write a simple function component that acts as a templating engine, taking a few inputs and formatting them to look nice on the page. A component like that has no ‚Äústateful logic‚Äù.</p>
<p>On a high level, we can simply think about stateful logic as the stuff we do with <code>useState</code> and non-visual behavior as the stuff we do with <code>useEffect</code>.</p>
<p>(No class components in this lecture, but the same ideas apply there too! In class components, your stateful logic will include <code>this.setState</code> calls, and non-visual behavior like event listeners and api calls will happen in the lifecycle methods.)</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-magic-computed-property-names">A bit of magic: computed property names üîÆ</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve had a lot of experience building form handlers with React, and forms are one of the most common pieces of reusable UI in any application.</p>
<p>What if we could abstract the entirety of the form handling logic into a helper function? That‚Äôs the idea behind the custom hook <code>useForm</code> in today‚Äôs guided project. The most clever bit of logic has to do with the <code>handleChanges</code> function. We‚Äôre used to writing something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> handleChanges <span class="op">=</span> (e) <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="at">setValue</span>(<span class="va">e</span>.<span class="va">target</span>.<span class="at">value</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>That works just fine if we write a new change handler for every single form field, but that gets messy very quickly as the form grows! So we write a single change handler that works for every field, with the help of the <code>"name"</code> attribute on each text input. This way, your change handler knows not only the value but <em>which form field the value came from</em>. So we can now store all the form fields as keys in an object and update the key for the field that‚Äôs been changed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> handleChanges <span class="op">=</span> (e) <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">    <span class="at">setValues</span>(<span class="op">{</span>...<span class="at">values</span><span class="op">,</span> [<span class="va">e</span>.<span class="va">target</span>.<span class="at">name</span>]<span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">values</span>.<span class="va">e</span>.<span class="va">target</span>.<span class="at">value</span><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The magic behind this clever one-liner is <code>[e.target.name]</code>, a ‚Äúcomputed property name‚Äù to dynamically choose which key to write the new value to. As long as the <code>name</code> of each form field matches up to a key in the <code>values</code> object, this single line of code effectively manages state for the entire form, with any number of fields! Pretty cool. Check the link on computed property names below for more info if you‚Äôre curious.</p>
<h2 id="local-storage">Local Storage ü§ñ</h2>
<p>In today‚Äôs guided project we‚Äôll be persisting data to the browser to improve the user experience. One very straightforward way to do this is with the localStorage api, which basically just saves key/value pairs locally in the browser. Here‚Äôs <code>localStorage</code> in a nutshell:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="va">localStorage</span>.<span class="at">setItem</span>(<span class="st">&#39;key&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&#39;value&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2"><span class="va">localStorage</span>.<span class="at">getItem</span>(<span class="st">&#39;key&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// returns &#39;value</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Along with <code>localStorage.removeItem</code> and <code>localStorage.clear()</code> for cleanup, that‚Äôs basically the entire API.</p>
<p>Local Storage is easy to work with, and the only tricky part is remembering to stringify and parse when working with objects. In a nutshell: * localStorage can store primitive types and strings, but it doesn‚Äôt directly store objects, arrays, or other advanced data structures. * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), the language of the web that we use to communicate with API‚Äôs and send objects and arrays back and forth, is just a form of <strong>text</strong>, aka a string! * So to store complex data structures in localStorage, we <code>JSON.stringify</code> them * and after retrieving a JSON string from localStorage, we turn it back into data with <code>JSON.parse</code></p>
<p>So, putting it all together, here‚Äôs a common workflow:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="kw">var</span> josh <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span><span class="dt">username</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&#39;joshjacobson&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">favoriteColor</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2"><span class="va">localStorage</span>.<span class="at">setItem</span>(<span class="st">&#39;signupFormValues&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="va">JSON</span>.<span class="at">stringify</span>(josh))<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" title="4"><span class="co">// new browsing session, retrieving saved value:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" title="5"><span class="kw">var</span> savedJosh <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">JSON</span>.<span class="at">parse</span>(<span class="va">localStorage</span>.<span class="at">getItem</span>(<span class="st">&#39;signupFormValues&#39;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// equal to the original object</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming ü§Ø</h2>
<p>Today we‚Äôll be ‚Äúcomposing‚Äù functions and building our own custom hooks. Pretty trendy sounding, but what does <em>function composition</em> really mean?</p>
<p>In building custom hooks, we‚Äôre writing functions that accept functions as their inputs and also return other functions as outputs. ‚ÄúFunctional programming‚Äù is a whole paradigm (just like object-oriented programming and other styles) but on a basic level it‚Äôs really just about this clever way of building useful abstractions by allowing functions to receive, call, and return other functions.</p>
<p>This is all possible because functions are treated as ‚Äúfirst-class objects‚Äù in JavaScript, meaning that they can be passed around as arguments, assigned to variables, and returned by other functions. Not every programming language is like this! It‚Äôs a helpful feature of JavaScript that functions are just another type of object inheriting from the same Object prototype.</p>
<p>All of this allows for some pretty powerful programming paradigms, many of which we‚Äôve already seen in React. So if ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù and ‚Äúfunction composition‚Äù sound overly complex just realize that you‚Äôve already worked with these paradigms before and you‚Äôll only continue to get more and more comfortable with it as we explore advanced techniques in React.</p>
<p>(Side note: the <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf">Œª calculus</a> is a mathematical system underpinning functional programming. Perhaps this is how Lambda School got its name?)</p>
