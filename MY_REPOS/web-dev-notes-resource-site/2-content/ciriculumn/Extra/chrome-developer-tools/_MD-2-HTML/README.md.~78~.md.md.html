<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Find the file <code>index.js</code> and complete the tasks until all of your tests pass.</p>
<p><strong>You can use yesterday’s work to help you.</strong> However, if you struggled a lot with that assignment, it is recommended that you attempt to re-write all code without “cheating” (peeking at yesterday’s code or copy-pasting it).</p>
<p><strong>Plan to commit &amp; push every time you get a new test passing!</strong>. Committing often makes it SO much easier to figure out “what broke my code”, and helps your TL keep track of how you’re doing.</p>
<p>If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. <strong>Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner</strong> - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.</p>

<li>Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github.</li>
<li>Clone <em>your</em> fork (not Lambda’s repo by mistake!).</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into your newly cloned repository.</li>
<li>Create a new branch by typing <code>git checkout -b &lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Install dependencies by typing <code>npm install</code>.</li>
<li>Run tests by typing <code>npm run test:watch</code>.</li>
<li>Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.</li>
