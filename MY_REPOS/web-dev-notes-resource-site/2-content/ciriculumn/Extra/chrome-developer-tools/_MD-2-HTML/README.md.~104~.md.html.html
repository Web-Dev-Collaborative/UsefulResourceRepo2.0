Minimum Viable Product
</h2>
<p>
After a set of interviews with the potential users of the solution, we gathered the following information about the desired functionality. Not all the information provided by our clients is relevant to the design of the solution, but it’s included to help understand the requirements.
</p>
<p>
Your job is to design and build a React application that includes at least two components: <code>Display</code> and <code>Dashboard</code>. <strong>For the MVP you only need to record information about a player’s <em>“at bat”</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
The specifications are listed below.
</p>
<h3 id="count-rules">
Count Rules
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
balls and strikes reset to 0 when a player reaches 3 strikes or 4 balls.
</li>
<li>
balls and strikes reset to 0 when a <code>hit</code> is recorded.
</li>
<li>
a <code>foul</code> increases strikes up to 2. With no strikes, a foul makes it 1 strike. With 1 strike, a foul makes it 2 strikes. With two strikes a foul has no effect, count stays at 2 strikes.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="display">
Display
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
display the count of <code>balls</code> and <code>strikes</code> for the at-bat.
</li>
<li>
should be updated when the user records activity on the <code>Dashboard</code> component.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dashboard">
Dashboard
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
provide a button that the person in charge can press every time there is a <code>strike</code>, <code>ball</code>, <code>foul</code> or <code>hit</code>.
</li>
<li>
there is <strong>NO</strong> need to specify the type of hit (single, double, etc).
</li>
<li>
changes recorded on this component should update the information shown by the <code>Display</code> component.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Feel free add other components and organize and name your components any way you want to satisfy the requirements. <strong>Make it up and make it happen developer!</strong>.

Stretch Problem
</h2>
<p>
This section is <strong>optional</strong> and not counted towards MVP. Start working on it after you’re done with the main assignment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Expand the solution to keep track of all the activity of a single inning. Include the number of outs and track them.
</li>
<li>
Expand the solution to keep track of the number of runs and errors in the inning.
</li>
<li>
Expand the solution to keep track of which bases are occupied and to record hits, doubles, triples and home runs.
</li>
<li>
Expand the solution to keep track of all activity across all innings. Display the current inning.
</li>
<li>
Work on <a href="https://github.com/LambdaSchool/React-Testing">this repository for extra practice testing a legacy React application</a>.
