Sprint Challenge: Express and Node.js - Projects &amp; Actions
</h1>
<h2 id="description">
Description
</h2>
<p>
In this challenge, you design and create a web API to manage the following resources: <code>Projects</code> and <code>Actions</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="instructions">
Instructions
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Read these instructions carefully</strong>. Understand exactly what is expected <strong><em>before</em></strong> starting to code.
</p>
<p>
This is an individual assessment, please work on it alone. It is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency of the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.
</p>
<p>
If the instructions are not clear, please seek support from your TL and Instructor on Slack.
</p>
<p>
The Minimum Viable Product must be completed in three hours.
</p>
<p>
Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Create a forked copy of this project.
</li>
<li>
[X] Add your <em>Team Lead</em> as collaborator on Github.
</li>
<li>
[X] Clone your forked version of the Repository.
</li>
<li>
[X] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b <code>firstName-lastName</code>.
</li>
<li>
[X] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
</li>
<li>
[X] Push commits: git push origin <code>firstName-lastName</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Follow these steps for completing your project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <code>firstName-lastName</code> Branch into master on <strong>your fork, don’t make Pull Requests against Lambda’s repository</strong>.
</li>
<li>
[X] Please don’t merge your own pull request.
</li>
<li>
[X] Add your <em>Team Lead</em> as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
</li>
<li>
[X] Your <em>Team Lead</em> will count the challenge as done by merging the branch into <em>master</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commits">
Commits
</h2>
<p>
Commit your code regularly and use descriptive messages. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code) and your Team Lead.
</p>
<h2 id="self-studyessay-questions">
Self-Study/Essay Questions
</h2>
<p>
Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint’s concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your Team Lead.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
[X] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
</p>
<p>
routing, middleware, convenience helpers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] Describe Middleware?
</p>
<p>
array of functions that get executed in the order they are introduced into the server code
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] Describe a Resource?
</p>
<p>
○ everything is a resource. ○ each resource is accessible via a unique URI. ○ resources can have multiple representations. ○ communication is done over a stateless protocol (HTTP). ○ management of resources is done via HTTP methods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
</p>
<p>
200/201 status code
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
</p>
<p>
By dividing the code up into multiple files and ‘requiring’ them in the main server file.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product">
Minimum Viable Product
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Configure an <em>npm script</em> named <em>“server”</em> that will execute your code using <em>nodemon</em>. Make <em>nodemon</em> be a development time dependency only, it shouldn’t be deployed to production.
</li>
<li>
[X] Configure an <em>npm script</em> named <em>“start”</em> that will execute your code using <em>node</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Design and build the necessary endpoints to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Perform CRUD operations on <em>projects</em> and <em>actions</em>. When adding an action, make sure the <code>project_id</code> provided belongs to an existing <code>project</code>. If you try to add an action with an <code>id</code> of 3 and there is no project with that <code>id</code> the database will return an error.
</li>
<li>
[X] Retrieve the list of actions for a project.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please read the following sections before implementing the Minimum Viable Product, they describe how the database is structured and the files and methods available for interacting with the data.

Database Persistence Helpers
</h3>
<p>
The <code>/data/helpers</code> folder includes files you can use to manage the persistence of <em>project</em> and <em>action</em> data. These files are <code>projectModel.js</code> and <code>actionModel.js</code>. Both files publish the following api, which you can use to store, modify and retrieve each resource:
</p>
<p>
<strong>All these helper methods return a promise. Remember to use .then().catch() or async/await.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>get()</code>: resolves to an array of all the resources contained in the database. If you pass an <code>id</code> to this method it will return the resource with that id if one is found.
</li>
<li>
<code>insert()</code>: calling insert passing it a resource object will add it to the database and return the newly created resource.
</li>
<li>
<code>update()</code>: accepts two arguments, the first is the <code>id</code> of the resource to update, and the second is an object with the <code>changes</code> to apply. It returns the updated resource. If a resource with the provided <code>id</code> is not found, the method returns <code>null</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>remove()</code>: the remove method accepts an <code>id</code> as it’s first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the resource from the database, returns the number of records deleted.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>projectModel.js</code> helper includes an extra method called <code>getProjectActions()</code> that takes a <em>project id</em> as it’s only argument and returns a list of all the <em>actions</em> for the <em>project</em>.
</p>
<p>
We have provided test data for all the resources.
</p>
<h2 id="stretch-goal">
Stretch Goal
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Use <code>create-react-app</code> to create an application in a separate folder (outside the API project folder). Name it anything you want.
</li>
<li>
[ ] From the React application show a list of all <em>projects</em> using the API you built.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add functionality to show the details of a project, including its actions, when clicking a project name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a separate route to show the project details.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add styling!
</li>
</ul>
