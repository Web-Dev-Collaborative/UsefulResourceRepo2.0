<h1 id="react-router-apple-nav---stretch-assignment">React Router Apple Nav - Stretch Assignment</h1>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Lets build out a navigation app that mimics <code>Apple's Slick Navigation</code> from their marketing website. At this point you have all the knowledge you’ll need to be able to complete this stretch assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="note-this-repository-is-to-be-used-as-a-stretch-assignment"><strong>NOTE</strong> This repository is to be used as a Stretch Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Now that you have played around with Routing and have been building out some nested routes etc. It’s time to get you into a little more practice. Remember that repetition is key.</li>
<li>[ ] The idea here is to build out a replica of Apple’s navigation.</li>
<li>[ ] Build out a menu similar to the one on https://www.apple.com with a top level navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Use <em>create-react-app</em> to make an application, name it <code>apple-nav</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] You’ll need to build out a few components here. Some variation of a <code>NavWrapper</code> component which will be your navigation header.</li>
<li>[ ] Lastly you’re going to need some sort of <code>SubNav</code> component, that will be reusable and display your sub-navigation links for each category.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stretch-problem">Stretch Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Once you are finished with the Navigation and SubNavigation components you’ll be able to look into ways to extend this application by adding some smooth transitions. Look into <a href="https://hackernoon.com/animated-page-transitions-with-react-router-4-reacttransitiongroup-and-animated-1ca17bd97a1a">this article</a> for an example of how this can be achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example shows the sub-navigation for the <code>/mac</code> route.</p>
