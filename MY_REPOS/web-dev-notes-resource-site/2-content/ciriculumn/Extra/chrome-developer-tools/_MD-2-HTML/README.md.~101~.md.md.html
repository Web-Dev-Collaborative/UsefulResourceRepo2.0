<li><code>cd</code> into <code>react-sorting-hat</code> directory and run <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code> to retrieve your dependancies.</li>
<li>run <code>npm start</code> or <code>yarn start</code> to spin up your <code>webpack development server</code></li>
<li>Inside of <code>./react-sorting-hat/src</code> create a directory called <code>components</code> and start to think about all of the components youâ€™ll need for this application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-description-and-requirements">Project description and requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a student stepping into the great hall at Hogwarts should be greeted with a message and I should be able to click a button that will initiate the sorting process.</li>
<li>I should then be asked a sequence of 6 questions that will determine to which of the 4 Hogwarts Houses I should belong.</li>
<li><p>When sorted, I should receive a message about which house I now belong in, that will include a history of the house and some unique facts about what type of people belong in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>The message page should be decorated to follow the house colors and crest.</li>
<li>As a part of this message I should also be informed of any Famous Wizards that have come any gone through my house.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses">this guide</a> to help craft your questions about the characteristics of each house.</li>
<li><p>In the event of a tie, simply randomize and select a house from the two options.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stretch-problems">Stretch Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Redo this entire project using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a>.</li>
<li>Look into <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for data persistence.
<ul>
<li>Use Firebase to build out a Login System so that as a user I can login to the app and have all messages be directed at my name.</li>
<li>All data tracked through the app should be stored in firebase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allow me (the user) the ability to share my hogwarts house decision to my social media platform of choice.</li>
</ul>
