<h1 id="http-ajax-ii-put-delete">HTTP / AJAX II: PUT / DELETE</h1>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>After today’s guided project, you should be able to: * make PUT requests to an external API using axios * make DELETE requests to an external API using axios</p>
<h2 id="review-http-crud-and-restful-services">Review: HTTP, CRUD and RESTful services</h2>
<p>Here’s a cheat sheet for how to interact with server-side web services from a front-end client like the React apps we’re building:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>HTTP Verb (axios)</th>
<th>CRUD naming</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Happy Path</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>get</td>
<td>Read</td>
<td>Read a representation of a resource</td>
<td>200 (OK)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>post</td>
<td>Create</td>
<td>Create new resources</td>
<td>201 (created)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>put</strong></td>
<td>Update</td>
<td>Update a resource</td>
<td>200 (OK) or 201 (created)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>delete</strong></td>
<td>Delete</td>
<td>Delete a resource</td>
<td>200 (OK) or 204 (no content)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Most modern API’s conform to the “representational state transfer” (REST) architecture, with a standardized format for how the “endpoints” (the addresses you send your API calls to) are laid out and how they behave. For example, a typical RESTful resource endpoint might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET /users (get all users)</li>
<li>GET /users/123 (get user with id ‘123’)</li>
<li>POST /users (create a new user, with data in payload)</li>
<li>PUT /users/123 (update user 123 with data in payload)</li>
<li>DELETE /users/123 (delete user 123)</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTP is a <em>protocol</em> that defines how servers and clients communicate over a network, essentially the foundation of the Internet as we know it. REST is an <em>architecture pattern</em> to standardize the way we build HTTP-based web services and clients.</p>
<p>Side note for the routes shown above: it’s very common for API endpoints to be “namespaced” with something like “v1/” to indicate the api version. Depending on the structure of your app, you might have endpoints with additional nesting, with a URL structure more like “api/v1/users”.</p>
<h2 id="put-vs-post">PUT vs POST</h2>
<p>The difference between these two types of requests is fairly straightforward: POST to create a new resource, PUT to update an existing one. If you’re ever unsure which to use, here’s a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p><strong>Does the resource I’d like to write to the database already exist?</strong> * If <strong>yes</strong>, we’re <strong>updating</strong> that resource so we should use PUT. * If <strong>no</strong>, we’re <strong>creating</strong> a new resource and should use POST.</p>
<p>For both of these requests, we going the resource id along with data we’d like the API to write to the database. In practice, HTTP (the <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>) doesn’t strictly enforce any of this so it’s up to you as the developer to think in terms of resources and follow the standard patterns of the REST architecture. Whether you’re a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer, knowing these patterns and best practices is extermely important for being able to write good code.</p>
<h2 id="delete">DELETE</h2>
<p>With a delete request, we simply pass the id of the resource to be deleted. It ends up looking quite similar to a GET request for a single resource, hitting the same URL and just using a different verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>GET /users/123 (get user with id ‘123’)</li>
<li>DELETE /users/123 (delete user 123)</li>
</ul>
