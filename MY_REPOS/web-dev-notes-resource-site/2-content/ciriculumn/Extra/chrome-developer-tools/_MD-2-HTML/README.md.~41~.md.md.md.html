<h1 id="javascript---iii">JavaScript - III</h1>
<p>This challenge focuses on using the <code>this</code> keyword as well as getting comfortable with prototypes by building out a fantasy themed video game.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-the-project-with-git">Set Up The Project With Git</h2>
<p><strong>Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.</li>
<li>[ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.</li>
<li>[ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda’s by mistake!).</li>
<li>[ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Implement the project on your newly created <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code> branch, committing changes regularly.</li>
<li>[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow these steps for completing your project.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student’s Repo). <strong>Please don’t merge your own pull request</strong></li>
<li>[ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request</li>
<li>[ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-set-up">Assignment Set Up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.</li>
<li>To test your <code>console.log()</code> statements, open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-this-keyword">The <code>this</code> keyword</h2>
<p>Having a solid understanding of how <code>this</code> works will give you a huge advantage when you start building with more advanced frameworks. Use the <a href="assignments/this.js">this.js</a> file to traverse through a few <code>this</code> problems.</p>
<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
<p>The prototype challenge will focus on building prototypes for a fantasy themed game that includes mages, swordsmen, and archers. Follow the <a href="assignments/this.js">prototypes.js</a> instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an awesome JavaScript game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges.</li>
<li>Remember to un-comment the objects and console logs to test your work at the bottom of the page.</li>
