<h1 id="sprint-challenge-single-page-applications">Sprint Challenge: Single Page Applications</h1>
<h2 id="rick-morty-edition">Rick &amp; Morty Edition</h2>
<p>This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past Sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored Single Page Applications, React Router I - II, and React Forms.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected <em>before</em> starting this Sprint Challenge.</strong></p>
<p>This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to collaborate with students during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support by reaching out through DM to your TL. You have <strong>three hours to complete</strong> this challenge. <strong>Plan your time accordingly.</strong></p>
<h2 id="commits">Commits</h2>
<p>In case you ever need to return to old code. Remember your <strong>ABC: Always Be Committing!</strong></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>In this challenge, you will create a Single Page Application complete with Client-Side Routing. It must consume a 3rd party API service (based on the TV show <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation">Rick and Morty</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="self-studyessay-questions">Self-Study/Essay Questions</h2>
<p>Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint‚Äôs concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Explain benefit(s) using <code>client-side routing</code>?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer: It‚Äôs much more efficient than the traditional way, because a lot of data isn‚Äôt being transmitted unnecessarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="project-set-up">Project Set Up</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>[X] Create a forked copy of this project.</li>
<li>[X] Add TL as collaborator on GitHub.</li>
<li>[X] Clone your OWN version of Repo (Not Lambda‚Äôs by mistake!).</li>
<li>[X] Create a new Branch on the clone: <code>git checkout -b &lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>[X] Implement the project on this branch, committing changes regularly.</li>
<li>[X] Push commits: <code>git push origin &lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>[X] <strong>LOOK</strong> at your project directory and notice it‚Äôs just a plain ol‚Äô React App that we‚Äôve built using <code>create-react-app</code>.</li>
<li>[X] <strong>RUN</strong> <code>yarn install</code> or <code>npm install</code> to retrieve the client-side dependencies.</li>
<li>[X] <strong>RUN</strong> <code>yarn start</code> or <code>npm start</code> to fire up your React application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exceeded-rate-limits">Exceeded rate limits?</h3>
<details>
<p><summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Expand for alternate API URL</summary></p>
<p>If the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation">main API service</a> goes down, or you exceed rate limits, try the following URL:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://rick-api.herokuapp.com/api/">Backup URL:</a></strong> <code>https://rick-api.herokuapp.com/api/</code></p>
You can still be locked out - watch your <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference">chrome devtools‚Äô network panel</a> to make sure you aren‚Äôt making too many requests.
</details>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The MVP of this project is broken up between a couple parts. Construct a Single Page Application with React.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:</strong></p>
<p><em>Display Data from a Server API</em> - [X] Fetch a list of characters from the Rick and Morty API‚Äôs Characters endpoint <em><code>https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/</code></em>¬†and render them to the screen. - [X] You must display at least one element for each character.</p>
<p><em>Add a Router to this application using <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start">React Router</a>.</em> - [X] Hook up the Welcome page(Home page) and a Characters page with React Router. - [X] Use a styling or component library for part of or all of your application. (Pick at least 1 of: <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">s</a>tyled-components or Reactstrap).</p>
<p><em>Add ‚ÄòSearch by Name‚Äô feature.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[X] Add the <code>&lt;SearchForm /&gt;</code> component (see <code>./components/SearchForm.js</code>).</li>
<li>[X] Create a search form that will filter through the data displayed in the character list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="required-best-practices"><strong>Required best practices:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>[X] Consistent naming. Examples: variables, functions, Components, and file/folder organization.</li>
<li>[X] Consistent spacing. Examples: line breaks, around arguments and before/after functions.</li>
<li>[X] Consistent quotation usage.</li>
<li>[X] Spell-check.</li>
<li>[X] Schedule time to review, refine and reassess your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is better to submit a challenge that meets¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>¬†than one that attempts too much and fails.</p>

<p>üöÄ Pro Tip: Complete as many stretch goals as possible! Even after the Sprint Challenge! You‚Äôll get a head start on important upcoming concepts!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stretch-goals">STRETCH GOALS üí™</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs a range of difficulty in the options below. üòà</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The most difficult stretch goal(s) could take an expert an hour or more.</p>
<p>Start with the most <em>familiar (or fun) sounding</em> stretch goal. Complete search component to your list views. - [X] Try adding 2 more components and display data from the episodes and locations end point. - [ ] https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/ - docs - [ ] https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/ - docs</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Wire up the <code>onSearch(name)</code> callback prop to support <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters">querying the API</a>. (To search for <code>rick</code>, you would request <code>/api/character/?name=rick</code>.)</li>
<li>[ ] Animate page transition and/or card loading.</li>
<li>[ ] Persist search form field(s) by using the custom hook <code>useLocalStorage</code>.</li>
<li>[X] Add error handling for all async (axios/AJAX) calls. (Including some styled UI.)</li>
<li>[ ] Add a ‚Äúdetails view‚Äù and route to show more details for each type of record. (Hint: Look into route parameters or nested routes.)</li>
<li>[ ] Similar to the ‚Äúdetails view‚Äù now with a UI twist: use a <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/modal/#variations-size">modal</a> component to show item view. (If you can, build <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-modal-gallery-classes-example-z98l5">modal with routes</a>.)</li>
<li>[ ] Add <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/addons/pagination/#types-pagination">paging support</a> (next/previous links.)</li>
<li>[ ] Refactor to use as few Components as possible - while still readable to a React Dev. (Hint: research these patterns: HoC, render props, FaaC.)</li>
<li>[X] Add additional fields to search form. They are unique for each endpoint. See **<a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters">Available parameters**.</a>, etc..</li>
<li>[ ] Use the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#graphql">GraphQL Endpoint</a> with multiple search fields.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>üí°Reminder: git commit -am ‚ÄòStretch Progress üí™‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="completing">Completing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow these steps to complete your project:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Submit a Pull Request to merge <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code> branch into master (student‚Äôs repo).</li>
<li>[ ] Add your TL as a Reviewer on the Pull Request.</li>
<li>[ ] TL then will count the HW as done by merging the branch into master.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TLs: NOTE: use resources to coach, or share over zoom - avoid sharing entire solution folder. Share preview links if available. -->
<blockquote>
<p>Note: AFTER Sprint Challenge: Solutions to many stretch goals (and live demo URLs) are available from TLs (or GitHub admins.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to implement each of these requirements!</p>
