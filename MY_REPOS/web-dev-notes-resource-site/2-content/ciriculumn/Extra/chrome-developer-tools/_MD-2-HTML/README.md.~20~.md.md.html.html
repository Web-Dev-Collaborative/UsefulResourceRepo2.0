Sprint Challenge: Express and Node.js - Projects &amp; Actions
</h1>
<p>
This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past Sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored Building RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js, Server-side Routing, Express Middleware &amp; Deployment and Good Practices. In your challenge for this Sprint, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an Web API using Node.js and Express.
</p>
<h2 id="instructions">
Instructions
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected <em>before</em> starting this Sprint Challenge.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.
</p>
<p>
You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express; and your command of the concepts and techniques taught during the Express and Node.js, Server-side Routing, Express Middleware &amp; Deployment and Good Practices modules.
</p>
<p>
You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.
</p>
<h2 id="commits">
Commits
</h2>
<p>
Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager).
</p>
<h2 id="description">
Description
</h2>
<p>
In this challenge, create a web API around the following resources: <code>Projects</code> and <code>Actions</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="self-studyessay-questions">
Self-Study/Essay Questions
</h2>
<p>
Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint’s concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>
Express has a similar middleware functionality like Redux, where Express automatically figures out the order in which it goes and knows specifically which function to invoke when next() iss called
</li>
<li>
I learned how to break our backend application into smaller chunks with Express Routes, which also makes the application easier to read and maintain
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Describe Middleware?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A bunch of code executed before the main action to check if all requests passing have the right body, has right properties etc. Essencially for authorization and authentication purposes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Describe a Resource?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The data that server posses, I believe. For example could be a list of hobits retrieved from a database.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It can return a success code 2xx where xx are different numbers. For example 200 means that something was successfully created on the server.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A combination of routing and importing functions. I like my middleware seperate from all http related stuff, for example, for easier maintanance.
</p>
<h2 id="project-setup">
Project Setup
</h2>
<p>
Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add your <em>Project Manager</em> as collaborator on Github.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Clone your forked version of the Repository.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Follow these steps for completing your project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master on your fork. <strong>Please don’t merge your own pull request.</strong>
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add your <em>Project Manager</em> as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
</li>
<li>
[ ] Your <em>Project Manager</em> will count the challenge as done by merging the branch into <em>master</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="database-persistence-helpers">
Database Persistence Helpers
</h2>
<p>
Please read the following before implementing the Minimum Viable Product:
</p>
<p>
The <code>/data/helpers</code> folder includes files you can use to manage the persistence of <em>project</em> and <em>action</em> data. These files are <code>projectModel.js</code> and <code>actionModel.js</code>. Both files publish the following api, which you can use to store, modify and retrieve each resource:
</p>
<p>
<strong>All these helper methods return a promise. Please you .then().catch() or async/await</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>get()</code>: calling get returns an array of all the resources contained in the database. If you pass an <code>id</code> to this method it will return the resource with that id if one is found.
</li>
<li>
<code>insert()</code>: calling insert passing it a resource object will add it to the database and return the newly created resource.
</li>
<li>
<code>update()</code>: accepts two arguments, the first is the <code>id</code> of the resource to update, and the second is an object with the <code>changes</code> to apply. It returns the updated resource. If a resource with the provided <code>id</code> is not found, the method returns <code>null</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>remove()</code>: the remove method accepts an <code>id</code> as it’s first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the resource from the database, returns the number of records deleted.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>projectModel.js</code> helper includes an extra method called <code>getProjectActions()</code> that takes a <em>project id</em> as it’s only argument and returns a list of all the <em>actions</em> for the <em>project</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product">
Minimum Viable Product
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Configure an <em>npm script</em> named <em>“server”</em> that will execute your code using <em>nodemon</em>. Make <em>nodemon</em> be a development time dependency only, it shouldn’t be deployed to production.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Configure an <em>npm script</em> named <em>“start”</em> that will execute your code using <em>node</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Design and build the necessary endpoints to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Perform CRUD operations on <em>projects</em> and <em>actions</em>. When adding an action, make sure the <code>project_id</code> provided belongs to an existing <code>project</code>. If you try to add an action with an <code>id</code> of 3 and there is no project with that <code>id</code> the database will return an error.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Retrieve the list of actions for a project.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have provided test data for all the resources.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have a way to add, update, remove and retrieve data from the provided database, it’s time to work on the API.
</p>
<h2 id="stretch-goal">
Stretch Goal
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Use <code>create-react-app</code> to create an application in a separate folder (outside the API project folder). Name it anything you want.
</li>
<li>
From the React application show a list of all <em>projects</em> using the API you built.
</li>
<li>
Add functionality to show the details of a project, including its actions, when clicking a project name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a separate route to show the project details.
</li>
<li>
Add styling! Perhaps with <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/"><code>styled-components</code></a>.
</li>
</ul>
