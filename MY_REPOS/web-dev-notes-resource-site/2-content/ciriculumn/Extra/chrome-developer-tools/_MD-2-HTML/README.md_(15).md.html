<h1 id="hash-tables-sprint-challenge">Hash Tables Sprint Challenge</h1>
<p>For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you’ll be working through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise’s directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the <code>.py</code> skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with <code>-v</code>.</p>
<h2 id="hint">Hint</h2>
<p>Remember: the hashtable key should be the thing you want to search quickly on! The value is what you want to get back from that search.</p>
