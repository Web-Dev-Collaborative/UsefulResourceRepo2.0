<h1 id="connected-components-in-a-graph">Connected Components in a Graph</h1>
<p>A <em>connected component</em> of a graph is a subgraph where all vertices are reachable via edges in the subgraph.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example of a graph with 8 connected components:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/connected-components.png" alt="Connected Components" /><figcaption>Connected Components</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Two of the connected components are single verts.)</p>
<h2 id="usefulness-of-connected-components">Usefulness of Connected Components</h2>
<p>There are a lot of theoretical uses of connected components that are beyond the scope of the course. But on the more practical front, here are some potential uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for people you might know in a social network.</li>
<li>Predict the spread of zombie apocalypse or other disease within social groups.</li>
<li>Determining which parts of a computer network are reachable from another.</li>
<li>Finding clusters of related information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-connected-components">Finding Connected Components</h2>
<p>If you have a BFS or DFS, finding connected components is pretty straightforward if you modify your search to return a list of verts visited. (Also modify the search to not always color the verts white at the start.)</p>
<pre class="pseudocode"><code>connected_components = [];

for v in graph.vertexes:
  v.color = white

for v in graph.vertexes:
  if v.color == white:
    component = bfs(v)
    connected_components.push(component);</code></pre>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Draw a graph of 8 vertexes with 3 connected components.</p>
