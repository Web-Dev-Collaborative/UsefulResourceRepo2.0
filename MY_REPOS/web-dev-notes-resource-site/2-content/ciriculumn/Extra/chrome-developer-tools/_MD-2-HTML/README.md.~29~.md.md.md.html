<h1 id="sprint-challenge-authentication---dad-jokes">Sprint Challenge: Authentication - Dad Jokes</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>In this challenge, you build a real wise-guy application. <em>Dad jokes</em> are all the rage these days. Currently the application is trying to receive some <code>Dad Jokes</code>, however we are locked out.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected <em>before</em> starting this Sprint Challenge.</strong></p>
<p>This is an individual assessment, please work on it alone. It is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.</p>
<p>If the instructions are not clear, please seek support from your TL and Instructor on Slack.</p>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product must be completed in three hours.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.</li>
<li>[ ] Add your <em>Team Lead</em> as collaborator on Github.</li>
<li>[ ] Clone your forked version of the Repository.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b <code>firstName-lastName</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.</li>
<li>[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>firstName-lastName</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps for completing your project.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <code>firstName-lastName</code> branch into <code>master</code> on your fork. <strong>Please don’t make Pull Requests against Lambda’s repository</strong>.</li>
<li>[ ] Please don’t merge your own pull request.</li>
<li>[ ] Add your <em>Team Lead</em> as a Reviewer on the Pull-request</li>
<li>[ ] Your <em>Team Lead</em> will count the challenge as done by merging the branch into <em>master</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commits">Commits</h2>
<p>Commit your code regularly and use descriptive messages. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code) and your Team Lead.</p>
<h2 id="self-studyessay-questions">Self-Study/Essay Questions</h2>
<p>Demonstrate your understanding of this week’s concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[ ] What is the purpose of using <em>sessions</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</h2>
<p>Implement an User Authentication System. Hash user’s passwords before saving them to the database. Use <code>JSON Web Tokens</code> or <code>Sessions and Cookies</code> to persist authentication across requests.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Implement the <code>register</code> and <code>login</code> functionality inside <code>/auth/auth-router.js</code>. A <code>user</code> has <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>. Both properties are required.</li>
<li>[ ] Implement the <code>authenticate</code> middleware inside <code>/auth/authenticate-middleware.js</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Write a <strong>minimum of 2 tests</strong> per API endpoint. Write more tests if you have time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the database already has the users table, but if you run into issues, the migrations are available.</p>
<h2 id="stretch-problem">Stretch Problem</h2>
<p>Build a front end to show the jokes.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Add a React client that connects to the API and has pages for <code>Sign Up</code>, <code>Sign In</code> and showing a list of <code>Jokes</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Once you have the functionality down, style it!</li>
</ul>
