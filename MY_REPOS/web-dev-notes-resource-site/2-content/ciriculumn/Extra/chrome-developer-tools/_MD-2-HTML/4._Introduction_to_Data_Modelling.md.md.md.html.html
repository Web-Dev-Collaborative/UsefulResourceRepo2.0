<em>“Treat software development like a hike. Plan thoroughly and have good travel companions. If you are in this mindset, you will be a valuable developer”.</em> <em>“The brightest of people can write garbage code because they treat coding like a skills challenge or a sport, and focus on speed and acrobatics. This results in horrible unreadable code”.</em>
