<h1 id="preprocessing-i-digital-resume">Preprocessing I: Digital Resume</h1>
<p>For this project you will be building a digital resume from scratch. You will be required to use specific preprocessing skills to accomplish your tasks.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-set-up-the-project-with-git">Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.</li>
<li>[ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.</li>
<li>[ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda’s by mistake!).</li>
<li>[ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Implement the project on your newly created <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code> branch, committing changes regularly.</li>
<li>[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps for completing your project.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student’s Repo). <strong>Please don’t merge your own pull request</strong></li>
<li>[ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request</li>
<li>[ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-2-set-up-your-preprocessor">Task 2: Set up your preprocessor</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running <code>lessc -v</code> in your terminal, if you don’t get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.</li>
<li>[ ] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the <code>cd</code> command</li>
<li>[ ] Once in your project’s root folder, run the following command <code>less-watch-compiler less css index.less</code></li>
<li>[ ] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the <code>background-color</code> on the <code>html</code> selector to <code>red</code></li>
<li>[ ] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you’re ready to start on the next task</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-3-project-objectives">Task 3: Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Review the <a href="resume-example.png">example resume</a>. Notice how simplistic the example resume is. Develop a simple layout of your choosing. If you are struggling to be creative, you may use the example resume as your design file. <strong>Note: you are only required to build one page, anything more than that would be stretch.</strong></li>
<li>[ ] The resume content will be provided by you. The content can be about you or a fictional character.<br />
</li>
<li>[ ] Content: Navigation - Build a simple navigation with 4 items of your choosing</li>
<li>[ ] Content: Intro - Have a short introduction as to why you would be a good hire</li>
<li>[ ] Content: Skills - Showcase a list of skills you have somewhere on your resume</li>
<li>[ ] Content: Work History - Showcase your work history somewhere on your resume</li>
<li>[ ] Content: Contact - Provide some way a potential employer could contact you. Phone number, email, or a full on contact form (doesn’t have to work)</li>
<li>[ ] Variables: Incorporate variables in your project for color and font stacks.<br />
</li>
<li>[ ] Nesting: Every selector should be nested inside the main container. Avoid having global styles unless they are element level.</li>
<li>[ ] Mixins: Create 2 mixins of your choosing. Hint: It’s super helpful to use flexbox properties in mixins</li>
<li>[ ] Mobile: Use nested-at rules to provide a mobile version of your resume. Use <code>500px</code> as a <code>max-width</code> for mobile.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stretch-goals">Stretch Goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Incorporate a google font of your choosing</li>
<li>[ ] Convert the great idea CSS into LESS. Introduce variables, mixins, nesting, etc.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a link to the portfolio page and create a layout that would allow users to see your work. A good idea is to link projects back to their github repos so employers can see your code.</li>
</ul>
