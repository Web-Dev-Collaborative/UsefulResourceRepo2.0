<ul>
<li><p>[X] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?</p>
<p>Because some companies still use class components and don’t want to switch their millions of dollars’ worth of code over to all functional hooks, and also there’s currently a lot more troubleshooting content out there for classes that isn’t out there for hooks. Also, functional components are better when you don’t need state, presentational components</p></li>
<li><p>[X] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.</p>
<p>componentDidMount = do the stuff inside this ‘function’ after the component mounted componentDidUpdate = do the stuff inside this function after the component updated componentWillUnmount = clean-up in death/unmounting phase</p></li>
<li><p>[X] What is the purpose of a custom hook?</p>
<p>allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components by reusing the same hook over and over again</p></li>
<li><p>[X] Why is it important to test our apps?</p>
<p>Gets bugs fixed faster, reduces regression risk, makes you consider/work out the edge cases, acts as documentation, acts as safety net when refactoring, makes code more trustworthy</p></li>
