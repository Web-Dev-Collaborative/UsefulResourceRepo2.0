<h1 id="project-animal-kingdom-search">Project Animal Kingdom Search</h1>
<p>A student that completes this project shows that they can: * implement and use interfaces in Java * implement and use abstract classes in Java * implement and use Lambda Expressions in Java</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Using a combination of interfaces, abstract classes, and lambda expressions, students will create and manipulate a list of animals using object oriented design principles.</p>
<h1 id="instruction">Instruction</h1>
<ul>
<li>[X] Create an abstract class for animals
<ul>
<li>[X] All animals consume food the same way</li>
<li><p>[X] Each animal is assigned a unique number, a name, and year discovered regardless of classification.</p></li>
<li>[X] Methods will return a string saying how that animal implements the action</li>
<li><p>[X] All animals can move, breath, reproduce. How they do that, so what string should get returned when the method is executed, varies by animal type.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create classes for mammals, birds, fish
<ul>
<li>[X] Mammals move - walk, breath - lungs, reproduce - live births</li>
<li>[X] Birds move - fly, breath - lungs, reproduce - eggs</li>
<li>[X] Fish move - swim, breath - gills, reproduce - eggs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: think about abstract classes and creating an arraylist using an abstract class type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a collection for the animals using the following data
<ul>
<li>[X] Mammals:
<ul>
<li>[X] Name: Panda Year Named: 1869</li>
<li>[X] Name: Zebra Year Named: 1778</li>
<li>[X] Name: Koala Year Named: 1816</li>
<li>[X] Name: Sloth Year Named: 1804</li>
<li>[X] Name: Armadillo Year Named: 1758</li>
<li>[X] Name: Raccoon Year Named: 1758</li>
<li>[X] Name: Bigfoot Year Named: 2021</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[X] Birds:
<ul>
<li>[X] Name: Pigeon Year Named: 1837</li>
<li>[X] Name: Peacock Year Named: 1821</li>
<li>[X] Name: Toucan Year Named: 1758</li>
<li>[X] Name: Parrot Year Named: 1824</li>
<li>[X] Name: Swan Year Named: 1758</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[X] Fish:
<ul>
<li>[X] Name: Salmon Year Named: 1758</li>
<li>[X] Name: Catfish Year Named: 1817</li>
<li>[X] Name: Perch Year Named: 1758</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using Lambda Expressions</p>
<ul>
<li>[X] List all the animals in descending order by year named</li>
<li>[X] List all the animals alphabetically</li>
<li>[X] List all the animals order by how they move</li>
<li>[X] List only those animals the breath with lungs</li>
<li>[X] List only those animals that breath with lungs and were named in 1758</li>
<li>[X] List only those animals that lay eggs and breath with lungs</li>
<li>[X] List alphabetically only those animals that were named in 1758</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stretch Goal
<ul>
<li>[X] For the list of animals, list alphabetically those animals that are mammals.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
