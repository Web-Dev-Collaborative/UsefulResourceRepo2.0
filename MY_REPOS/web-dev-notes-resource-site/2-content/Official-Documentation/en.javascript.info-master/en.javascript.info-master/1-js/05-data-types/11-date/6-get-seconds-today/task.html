<h1 id="how-many-seconds-have-passed-today">How many seconds have passed today?</h1>
<p>Write a function <code>getSecondsToday()</code> that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.</p>
<p>For instance, if now were <code>10:00 am</code>, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="at">getSecondsToday</span>() <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">36000</span> <span class="co">// (3600 * 10)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.</p>
