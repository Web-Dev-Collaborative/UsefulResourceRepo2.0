<p>```js run demo let a = +prompt(“The first number?”, "“); let b = +prompt(”The second number?“,”");</p>
<p>alert( a + b ); ```</p>
<p>Note the unary plus <code>+</code> before <code>prompt</code>. It immediately converts the value to a number.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> would be string their sum would be their concatenation, that is: <code>"1" + "2" = "12"</code>.</p>
