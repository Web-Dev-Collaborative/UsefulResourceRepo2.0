<p>The method <code>date.getDay()</code> returns the number of the weekday, starting from sunday.</p>
<p>Let’s make an array of weekdays, so that we can get the proper day name by its number:</p>
<p>```js run demo function getWeekDay(date) { let days = [‘SU’, ‘MO’, ‘TU’, ‘WE’, ‘TH’, ‘FR’, ‘SA’];</p>
<p>return days[date.getDay()]; }</p>
<p>let date = new Date(2014, 0, 3); // 3 Jan 2014 alert( getWeekDay(date) ); // FR ```</p>
