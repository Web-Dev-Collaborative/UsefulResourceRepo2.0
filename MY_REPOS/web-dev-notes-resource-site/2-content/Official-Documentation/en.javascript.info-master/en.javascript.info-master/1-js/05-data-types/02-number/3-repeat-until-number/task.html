<p>Create a function <code>readNumber</code> which prompts for a number until the visitor enters a valid numeric value.</p>
<p>The resulting value must be returned as a number.</p>
<p>The visitor can also stop the process by entering an empty line or pressing “CANCEL”. In that case, the function should return <code>null</code>.</p>
