<h1 id="find-window-coordinates-of-the-field">Find window coordinates of the field</h1>
<p>In the iframe below you can see a document with the green “field”.</p>
<p>Use JavaScript to find window coordinates of corners pointed by with arrows.</p>
<p>There’s a small feature implemented in the document for convenience. A click at any place shows coordinates there.</p>
<p>[iframe border=1 height=360 src=“source” link edit]</p>
<p>Your code should use DOM to get window coordinates of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upper-left, outer corner (that’s simple).</li>
<li>Bottom-right, outer corner (simple too).</li>
<li>Upper-left, inner corner (a bit harder).</li>
<li>Bottom-right, inner corner (there are several ways, choose one).</li>
</ol>
<p>The coordinates that you calculate should be the same as those returned by the mouse click.</p>
<p>P.S. The code should also work if the element has another size or border, not bound to any fixed values.</p>
