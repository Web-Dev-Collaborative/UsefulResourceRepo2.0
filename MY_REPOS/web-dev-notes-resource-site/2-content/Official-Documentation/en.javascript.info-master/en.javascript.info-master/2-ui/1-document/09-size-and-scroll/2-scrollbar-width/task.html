<h1 id="what-is-the-scrollbar-width">What is the scrollbar width?</h1>
<p>Write the code that returns the width of a standard scrollbar.</p>
<p>For Windows it usually varies between <code>12px</code> and <code>20px</code>. If the browser doesnâ€™t reserve any space for it (the scrollbar is half-translucent over the text, also happens), then it may be <code>0px</code>.</p>
<p>P.S. The code should work for any HTML document, do not depend on its content.</p>
