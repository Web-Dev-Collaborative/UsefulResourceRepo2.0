<p>We should use two handlers: <code>document.onkeydown</code> and <code>document.onkeyup</code>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s create a set <code>pressed = new Set()</code> to keep currently pressed keys.</p>
<p>The first handler adds to it, while the second one removes from it. Every time on <code>keydown</code> we check if we have enough keys pressed, and run the function if it is so.</p>
