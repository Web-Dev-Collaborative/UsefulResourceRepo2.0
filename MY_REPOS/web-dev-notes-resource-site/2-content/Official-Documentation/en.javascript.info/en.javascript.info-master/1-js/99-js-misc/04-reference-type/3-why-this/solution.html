<p>Here’s the explanations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>That’s a regular object method call.</p></li>
<li><p>The same, parentheses do not change the order of operations here, the dot is first anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Here we have a more complex call <code>(expression)()</code>. The call works as if it were split into two lines:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify  f = obj.go; // calculate the expression  f();        // call what we have</code></p>
<p>Here <code>f()</code> is executed as a function, without <code>this</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The similar thing as <code>(3)</code>, to the left of the parentheses <code>()</code> we have an expression.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To explain the behavior of <code>(3)</code> and <code>(4)</code> we need to recall that property accessors (dot or square brackets) return a value of the Reference Type.</p>
<p>Any operation on it except a method call (like assignment <code>=</code> or <code>||</code>) turns it into an ordinary value, which does not carry the information allowing to set <code>this</code>.</p>
