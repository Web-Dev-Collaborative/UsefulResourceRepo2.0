<p><strong>Error</strong>!</p>
<p>Try it:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, go: function() { alert(this.name) } }</p>
<p>(user.go)() // error! ```</p>
<p>The error message in most browsers does not give us much of a clue about what went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>The error appears because a semicolon is missing after <code>user = {...}</code>.</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript does not auto-insert a semicolon before a bracket <code>(user.go)()</code>, so it reads the code like:</p>
<p><code>js no-beautify let user = { go:... }(user.go)()</code></p>
<p>Then we can also see that such a joint expression is syntactically a call of the object <code>{ go: ... }</code> as a function with the argument <code>(user.go)</code>. And that also happens on the same line with <code>let user</code>, so the <code>user</code> object has not yet even been defined, hence the error.</p>
<p>If we insert the semicolon, all is fine:</p>
<p>```js run let user = { name: “John”, go: function() { alert(this.name) } }<em>!</em>;<em>/!</em></p>
<p>(user.go)() // John ```</p>
<p>Please note that parentheses around <code>(user.go)</code> do nothing here. Usually they setup the order of operations, but here the dot <code>.</code> works first anyway, so there’s no effect. Only the semicolon thing matters.</p>
