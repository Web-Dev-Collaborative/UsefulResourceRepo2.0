<p>The first two checks turn into two <code>case</code>. The third check is split into two cases:</p>
<p>```js run let a = +prompt(‘a?’, ’’);</p>
<p>switch (a) { case 0: alert( 0 ); break;</p>
<p>case 1: alert( 1 ); break;</p>
<p>case 2: case 3: alert( ‘2,3’ ); <em>!</em> break; <em>/!</em> } ```</p>
<p>Please note: the <code>break</code> at the bottom is not required. But we put it to make the code future-proof.</p>
<p>In the future, there is a chance that we’d want to add one more <code>case</code>, for example <code>case 4</code>. And if we forget to add a break before it, at the end of <code>case 3</code>, there will be an error. So that’s a kind of self-insurance.</p>
