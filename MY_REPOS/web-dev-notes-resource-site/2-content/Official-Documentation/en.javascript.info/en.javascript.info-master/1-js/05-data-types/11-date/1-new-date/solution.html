<p>The <code>new Date</code> constructor uses the local time zone. So the only important thing to remember is that months start from zero.</p>
<p>So February has number 1.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example with numbers as date components:</p>
<p><code>js run //new Date(year, month, date, hour, minute, second, millisecond) let d1 = new Date(2012, 1, 20, 3, 12); alert( d1 );</code> We could also create a date from a string, like this:</p>
<p><code>js run //new Date(datastring) let d2 = new Date("February 20, 2012 03:12:00"); alert( d2 );</code></p>
