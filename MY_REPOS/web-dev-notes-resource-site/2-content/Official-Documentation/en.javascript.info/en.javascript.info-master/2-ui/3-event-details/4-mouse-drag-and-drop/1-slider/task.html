<h1 id="slider">Slider</h1>
<p>Create a slider:</p>
<p>[iframe src=“solution” height=60 border=1]</p>
<p>Drag the blue thumb with the mouse and move it.</p>
<p>Important details:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the mouse button is pressed, during the dragging the mouse may go over or below the slider. The slider will still work (convenient for the user).</li>
<li>If the mouse moves very fast to the left or to the right, the thumb should stop exactly at the edge.</li>
</ul>
