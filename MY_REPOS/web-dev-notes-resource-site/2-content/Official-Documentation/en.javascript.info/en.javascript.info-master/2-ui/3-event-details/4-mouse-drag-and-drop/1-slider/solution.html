<p>As we can see from HTML/CSS, the slider is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a colored background, that contains a runner – another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code>position:relative</code>.</p>
<p>To position the runner we use <code>position:relative</code>, to provide the coordinates relative to its parent, here it’s more convenient here than <code>position:absolute</code>.</p>
<p>Then we implement horizontal-only Drag’n’Drop with limitation by width.</p>
