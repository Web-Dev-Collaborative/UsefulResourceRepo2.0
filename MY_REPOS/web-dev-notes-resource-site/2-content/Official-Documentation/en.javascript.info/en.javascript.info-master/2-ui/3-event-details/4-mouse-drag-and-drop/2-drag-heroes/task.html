<p>This task can help you to check understanding of several aspects of Drag’n’Drop and DOM.</p>
<p>Make all elements with class <code>draggable</code> – draggable. Like a ball in the chapter.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use event delegation to track drag start: a single event handler on <code>document</code> for <code>mousedown</code>.</li>
<li>If elements are dragged to top/bottom window edges – the page scrolls up/down to allow further dragging.</li>
<li>There is no horizontal scroll (this makes the task a bit simpler, adding it is easy).</li>
<li>Draggable elements or their parts should never leave the window, even after swift mouse moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>The demo is too big to fit it here, so here’s the link.</p>
