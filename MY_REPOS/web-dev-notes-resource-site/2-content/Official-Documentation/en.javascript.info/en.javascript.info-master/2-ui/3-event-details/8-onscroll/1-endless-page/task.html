<p>importance: 5</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="endless-page">Endless page</h1>
<p>Create an endless page. When a visitor scrolls it to the end, it auto-appends current date-time to the text (so that a visitor can scroll more).</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>[iframe src=“solution” height=200]</p>
<p>Please note two important features of the scroll:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The scroll is “elastic”.</strong> We can scroll a little beyond the document start or end in some browsers/devices (empty space below is shown, and then the document will automatically “bounces back” to normal).</li>
<li><strong>The scroll is imprecise.</strong> When we scroll to page end, then we may be in fact like 0-50px away from the real document bottom.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, “scrolling to the end” should mean that the visitor is no more than 100px away from the document end.</p>
<p>P.S. In real life we may want to show “more messages” or “more goods”.</p>
