<p>Make table cells editable on click.</p>
<ul>
<li>On click – the cell should became “editable” (textarea appears inside), we can change HTML. There should be no resize, all geometry should remain the same.</li>
<li>Buttons OK and CANCEL appear below the cell to finish/cancel the editing.</li>
<li>Only one cell may be editable at a moment. While a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> is in “edit mode”, clicks on other cells are ignored.</li>
<li>The table may have many cells. Use event delegation.</li>
</ul>
