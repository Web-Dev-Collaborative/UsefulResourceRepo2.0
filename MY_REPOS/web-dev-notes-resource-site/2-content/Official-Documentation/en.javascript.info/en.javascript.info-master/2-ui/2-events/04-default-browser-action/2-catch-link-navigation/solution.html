<p>That’s a great use of the event delegation pattern.</p>
<p>In real life instead of asking we can send a “logging” request to the server that saves the information about where the visitor left. Or we can load the content and show it right in the page (if allowable).</p>
<p>All we need is to catch the <code>contents.onclick</code> and use <code>confirm</code> to ask the user. A good idea would be to use <code>link.getAttribute('href')</code> instead of <code>link.href</code> for the URL. See the solution for details.</p>
