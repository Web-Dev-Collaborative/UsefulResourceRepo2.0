<p>The HTML in the task is incorrect. That’s the reason of the odd thing.</p>
<p>The browser has to fix it automatically. But there may be no text inside the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>: according to the spec only table-specific tags are allowed. So the browser adds <code>"aaa"</code> <em>before</em> the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Now it’s obvious that when we remove the table, it remains.</p>
<p>The question can be easily answered by exploring the DOM using the browser tools. It shows <code>"aaa"</code> before the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The HTML standard specifies in detail how to process bad HTML, and such behavior of the browser is correct.</p>
