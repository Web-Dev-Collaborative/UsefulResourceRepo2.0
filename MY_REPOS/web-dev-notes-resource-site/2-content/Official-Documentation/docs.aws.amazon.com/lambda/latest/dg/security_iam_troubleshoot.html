                                    this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

                                    role to the service.

                                    together to authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you

                                    is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you
                                    must add new access keys to your IAM user. You can have a

                                    before creating a new one. To view instructions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey">Managing access keys</a> in the
