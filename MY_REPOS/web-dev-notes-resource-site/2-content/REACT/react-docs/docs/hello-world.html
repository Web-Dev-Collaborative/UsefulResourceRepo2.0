<p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="va">ReactDOM</span>.<span class="at">render</span>(</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="op">&lt;</span>h1<span class="op">&gt;</span>Hello<span class="op">,</span> world<span class="op">!</span>&lt;/h1<span class="op">&gt;,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">  <span class="va">document</span>.<span class="at">getElementById</span>(<span class="st">&#39;root&#39;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>It displays a heading saying "Hello, world!" on the page.</p>
<p><a href="codepen://hello-world"></a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-this-guide">How to Read This Guide</h2>
<p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>This guide is designed for people who prefer <strong>learning concepts step by step</strong>. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our <a href="/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial</a>. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters
    in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing
    the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.</p>
<p>Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. <strong>You can learn most of React by reading the "Main Concepts" guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.</strong> For example, <a href="/docs/introducing-jsx.html">"Introducing JSX"</a> is the next chapter after this one.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-level-assumptions">Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
<p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language.
    <strong>If you don't feel very confident, we recommend <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">going through
            a JavaScript tutorial</a> to check your knowledge level</strong> and enable you to follow along this guide
    without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like
    you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with
    JavaScript in the last few years, <a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c">these
        three points</a> should get you most of the way.</p>
