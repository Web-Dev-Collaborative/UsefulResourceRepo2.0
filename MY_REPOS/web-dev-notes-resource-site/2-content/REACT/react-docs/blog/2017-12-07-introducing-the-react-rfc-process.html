<p>We're adopting an RFC ("request for comments") process for contributing ideas to React.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs">Ember</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">Rust</a>, the goal is to allow React core team members and community
    members to collaborate on the design of new features. It's also intended to provide a clear path for ideas to enter
    the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an RFC document detailing your proposal.</li>
<li>Submit a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs">RFC repository</a>.</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback into the proposal.</li>
<li>After discussion, the core team may or may not accept the RFC.</li>
<li>If the RFC is accepted, the PR is merged.</li>
</ul>
<p>RFCs are accepted when they are approved for implementation in React. A more thorough description of the process is
    available in the repository's <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/master/README.md">README</a>. The exact
    details may be refined in the future.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-submit-rfcs">Who Can Submit RFCs?</h2>
<p>Anyone! No knowledge of React's internals is required, nor are you expected to implement the proposal yourself.</p>
<p>As with our other repositories, we do ask that you complete a <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs#contributor-license-agreement-cla">Contributor License Agreement</a> before we can accept your PR.</p>
<h2 id="what-types-of-changes-should-be-submitted-as-rfcs">What Types of Changes Should Be Submitted As RFCs?</h2>
<p>Generally, any idea that would benefit from additional review or design before being implemented is a good candidate for an RFC. As a rule of thumb, this means any proposal that adds, changes, or removes a React API.</p>
<p>Not every change must go through the RFC process. Bug fixes or performance improvements that don't touch the API can
    be submitted directly to the main library.</p>
<p>We now have several repositories where you can submit contributions to React:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issues, bugfixes, and code changes to the main library</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">facebook/react</a></li>
<li><strong>Website and documentation</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org">reactjs/reactjs.org</a></li>
<li><strong>Ideas for changes that need additional review before being implemented</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs">reactjs/rfcs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rfc-for-a-new-context-api">RFC for A New Context API</h2>
<p>Coinciding with the launch of our RFC process, we've submitted a <a
        href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/2">proposal for a new version of context</a>. The proposal has
    already received many valuable comments from the community that we will incorporate into the design of the new API.
</p>
<p>The context PR is a good example of how a typical RFC should be structured. We're excited to start receiving your
    proposals!</p>
