<p>Today we're happy to announce the initial release of <a href="http://reactjs.net/">ReactJS.NET</a>, which makes it
    easier to use React and JSX in .NET applications, focusing specifically on ASP.NET MVC web applications. It has
    several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On-the-fly JSX to JavaScript compilation. Simply reference JSX files and they will be compiled and cached server-side.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;script</span><span class="ot"> src=</span><span class="st">&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;</span><span class="er">/Scripts/HelloWorld.jsx&quot;)&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li>JSX to JavaScript compilation via popular minification/combination libraries (Cassette and ASP.NET Bundling and Minification). This is suggested for production websites.</li>
<li><p>Server-side component rendering to make your initial render super fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though we are focusing on ASP.NET MVC, ReactJS.NET can also be used in Web Forms applications as well as non-web applications (for example, in build scripts). ReactJS.NET currently only works on Microsoft .NET but we are working on support for Linux and Mac OS X via Mono as well.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>ReactJS.NET is packaged in NuGet. Simply run <code>Install-Package React.Mvc4</code> in the package manager console or search NuGet for "React" to install it. <a href="http://reactjs.net/docs">See the documentation</a> for more information. The GitHub project contains <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/tree/master/src/React.Sample.Mvc4">a sample website</a> demonstrating all of the features.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think, and feel free to send through any feedback and report bugs <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET">on GitHub</a>.</p>
