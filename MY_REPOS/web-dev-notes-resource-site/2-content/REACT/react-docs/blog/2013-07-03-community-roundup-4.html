<p>React reconciliation process appears to be very well suited to implement a text editor with a live preview as people at Khan Academy show us.</p>
<h2 id="khan-academy">Khan Academy</h2>
<p><a href="http://bjk5.com/">Ben Kamens</a> explains how <a href="http://sophiebits.com/">Sophie Alpert</a> and <a href="http://joelburget.com/">Joel Burget</a> are promoting React inside of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. They now have three projects in the works using React.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently two Khan Academy devs dropped into our team chat and said they were gonna use React to write a new feature. They even hinted that we may want to adopt it product-wide.</p>
<p>"The library is only a week old. It's a brand new way of thinking about things. We're the first to use it outside of
    Facebook. Heck, even the React devs were surprised to hear we're using this in production!!!"</p>

<p>The best part is the demo of how React reconciliation process makes live editing more user-friendly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our renderer, post-React, is on the left. A typical math editor's preview is on the right.</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, members of our team, <a href="http://www.petehunt.net/">Pete Hunt</a> and <a
        href="http://zpao.com/">Paul O'Shannessy</a>, answered many questions that were asked in the <a
        href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reactjs">React group</a>. They give a good overview of how to
    integrate React with other libraries and APIs through the use of <a href="/docs/reusable-components.html">Mixins</a>
    and <a href="/docs/working-with-the-browser.html">Lifecycle Methods</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/aabeL/1/">JSFiddle</a>: Basically I've given you two mixins. The first lets you react
    to global scroll events. The second is, IMO, much more useful: it gives you scroll start and scroll end events,
    which you can use with setState() to create components that react based on whether the user is scrolling or not.
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/RVAY_eQmdpo">Fade-in Transition</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ufe8k/1/">JSFiddle</a>: Creating a new <code>&lt;FadeInWhenAdded&gt;</code> component and using jQuery <code>.fadeIn()</code> function on the DOM node.</li>
<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/R8f5L/5/">JSFiddle</a>: Using CSS transition instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/pyUZBRWcHB4">Socket.IO Integration</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/zpao/5686416">Gist</a>: The big thing to notice is that my component is pretty dumb
    (it doesn't have to be but that's how I chose to model it). All it does is render itself based on the props that are
    passed in. renderOrUpdate is where the "magic" happens.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/petehunt/5687230">Gist</a>: This example is doing everything – including the IO – inside of a single React component.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/petehunt/5687276">Gist</a>: One pattern that we use at Instagram a lot is to employ separation of concerns and consolidate I/O and state into components higher in the hierarchy to keep the rest of the components mostly stateless and purely display.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/mHfBGI3Qwz4">Sortable jQuery Plugin Integration</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/LQxy7/">JSFiddle</a>: Your React component simply render empty divs, and then in componentDidMount() you call React.renderComponent() on each of those divs to set up a new root React tree. Be sure to explicitly unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode() for each component in componentWillUnmount().</li>
