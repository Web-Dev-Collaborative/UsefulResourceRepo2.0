<p>Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov kicked off Day 1 with their keynote, React Today and Tomorrow. In the talk, they introduced <a href="/docs/hooks-intro.html">Hooks</a>, which are a new proposal that adds the ability to access features such as state without writing a JavaScript class. Hooks promise to dramatically simplify the code required for React components and are currently available in a React alpha release.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Parashuram N spoke in detail about React Native's New Architecture, a long-term project that the
    React Native team has been working on over the past year and <a
        href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018">announced in June</a>. We're really
    excited about the potential of this project to improve performance, simplify interoperability with other libraries,
    and set a strong foundation for the future of React Native.</p>
<p>Now that the conference is over, all 28 conference talks are <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ">available to stream online</a>.
    There are tons of great ones from both days. We can't wait until next year!</p>
