<p>In this Round-up, we are taking a few closer looks at React's interplay with different frameworks and architectures.
</p>
<h2 id="little-framework-big-splash">"Little framework BIG splash"</h2>
<p>Let's start with yet another refreshing introduction to React: Craig Savolainen (<span class="citation"
        data-cites="maedhr">[@maedhr]</span>(https://twitter.com/maedhr)) walks through some first steps, demonstrating
    <a href="http://infinitemonkeys.influitive.com/little-framework-big-splash">how to build a Google Maps component</a>
    using React.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>React is not a full MVC framework, and this is actually one of its strengths. Many who adopt React choose to do so
    alongside their favorite MVC framework, like Backbone. React has no opinions about routing or syncing data, so you
    can easily use your favorite tools to handle those aspects of your frontend application. You'll often see React used
    to manage specific parts of an application's UI and not others. React really shines, however, when you fully embrace
    its strategies and make it the core of your application's interface.</p>

<h2 id="react-vs-async-dom-manipulation">React vs. async DOM manipulation</h2>
<p>Eliseu Monar (<span class="citation" data-cites="eliseumds">[@eliseumds]</span>(https://twitter.com/eliseumds))'s
    post "<a
        href="http://eliseumds.tumblr.com/post/77843550010/vitalbox-pchr-reactjs-vs-async-concurrent-rendering">ReactJS
        vs async concurrent rendering</a>" is a great example of how React quite literally renders a whole array of
    common web development work(arounds) obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="react-scala-and-the-play-framework">React, Scala and the Play Framework</h2>
<p><a href="http://matthiasnehlsen.com/">Matthias Nehlsen</a> wrote a detailed introductory piece on <a href="http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/01/05/play-framework-and-facebooks-react-library/">React and the Play Framework</a>, including a helpful architectural diagram of a typical React app.</p>
<p>Nehlsen's React frontend is the second implementation of his chat application's frontend, following an AngularJS
    version. Both implementations are functionally equivalent and offer some perspective on differences between the two
    frameworks.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/01/24/scala-dot-js-and-reactjs/">another article</a>, he walks us through the process of using React with scala.js to implement app-wide undo functionality.</p>
<p>Also check out his <a href="http://m.ustream.tv/recorded/42780242">talk</a> at Ping Conference 2014, in which he walks through a lot of the previously content in great detail.</p>
<h2 id="react-and-backbone">React and Backbone</h2>
<p>The folks over at <a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a> are using React in conjunction with Backbone. Thomas Boyt (<span class="citation" data-cites="thomasaboyt">[@thomasaboyt]</span>(https://twitter.com/thomasaboyt)) wrote <a href="http://www.thomasboyt.com/2013/12/17/using-reactjs-as-a-backbone-view.html">this detailed piece</a> about why React and Backbone are "a fantastic pairing".</p>
<h2 id="react-vs-ember">React vs. Ember</h2>
<p>Eric Berry (<span class="citation" data-cites="coderberry">[@coderberry]</span>(https://twitter.com/coderberry)) developed Ember equivalents for some of the official React examples. Read his post for a side-by-side comparison of the respective implementations: <a href="https://instructure.github.io/blog/2013/12/17/facebook-react-vs-ember/">"Facebook React vs. Ember"</a>.</p>
<h2 id="react-and-plain-old-html">React and plain old HTML</h2>
<p>Daniel Lo Nigro (<span class="citation" data-cites="Daniel15">[@Daniel15]</span>(https://twitter.com/Daniel15)) created <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-magic">React-Magic</a>, which leverages React to ajaxify plain old html pages and even <a href="http://stuff.dan.cx/facebook/react-hacks/magic/red.php">allows CSS transitions between pageloads</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>React-Magic intercepts all navigation (link clicks and form posts) and loads the requested page via an AJAX request. React is then used to "diff" the old HTML with the new HTML, and only update the parts of the DOM that have been changed.</p>

<h3 id="ng-react-update">ng-React Update</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davidchang">David Chang</a> works through some performance improvements of his <a href="https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact">ngReact</a> project. His post <a href="http://davidandsuzi.com/ngreact-update/">"ng-React Update - React 0.9 and Angular Track By"</a> includes some helpful advice on boosting render performance for Angular components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angular gives you a ton of functionality out of the box - a full MV* framework - and I am a big fan, but I'll admit
    that you need to know how to twist the right knobs to get performance.</p>
<p>That said, React gives you a very strong view component out of the box with the performance baked right in. Try as I
    did, I couldn't actually get it any faster. So pretty impressive stuff.</p>

<p>React was also recently mentioned at ng-conf, where the Angular team commented on React's concept of the virtual DOM:

<h2 id="immutable-react">Immutable React</h2>
<p><a href="http://pk11.kinja.com/">Peter Hausel</a> shows how to build a Wikipedia auto-complete demo based on
    immutable data structures (similar to <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/mori">mori</a>), really taking advantage of
    the framework's one-way reactive data binding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its truly reactive design makes DOM updates finally sane and when combined with persistent data structures one can experience JavaScript development like it was never done before.</p>
