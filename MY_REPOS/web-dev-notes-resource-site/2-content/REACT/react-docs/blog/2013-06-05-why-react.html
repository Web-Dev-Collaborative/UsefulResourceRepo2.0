<p>There are a lot of JavaScript MVC frameworks out there. Why did we build React and why would you want to use it?</p>
<h2 id="react-isnt-an-mvc-framework">React isn't an MVC framework.</h2>
<p>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.</p>
<h2 id="react-doesnt-use-templates">React doesn't use templates.</h2>
<p>Traditionally, web application UIs are built using templates or HTML directives. These templates dictate the full set of abstractions that you are allowed to use to build your UI.</p>
<p>React approaches building user interfaces differently by breaking them into <strong>components</strong>. This means React uses a real, full featured programming language to render views, which we see as an advantage over templates for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript is a flexible, powerful programming language</strong> with the ability to build abstractions. This is incredibly important in large applications.</li>
<li>By unifying your markup with its corresponding view logic, React can actually make views <strong>easier to extend and maintain</strong>.</li>
<li>By baking an understanding of markup and content into JavaScript, there's <strong>no manual string
        concatenation</strong> and therefore less surface area for XSS vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also created <a href="/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX</a>, an optional syntax extension, in case you prefer the
    readability of HTML to raw JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-updates-are-dead-simple">Reactive updates are dead simple.</h2>
<p>React really shines when your data changes over time.</p>
<p>In a traditional JavaScript application, you need to look at what data changed and imperatively make changes to the DOM to keep it up-to-date. Even AngularJS, which provides a declarative interface via directives and data binding <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.0.8/docs/guide/directive#reasonsbehindthecompilelinkseparation">requires a linking function to manually update DOM nodes</a>.</p>
<p>React takes a different approach.</p>
<p>When your component is first initialized, the <code>render</code> method is called, generating a lightweight representation of your view. From that representation, a string of markup is produced, and injected into the document. When your data changes, the <code>render</code> method is called again. In order to perform updates as efficiently as possible, we diff the return value from the previous call to <code>render</code> with the new one, and generate a minimal set of changes to be applied to the DOM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data returned from <code>render</code> is neither a string nor a DOM node â€“ it's a lightweight description of
    what the DOM should look like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We call this process <strong>reconciliation</strong>. Check out <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2h6th4ju/">this jsFiddle</a> to see an example of reconciliation in action.</p>
<p>Because this re-render is so fast (around 1ms for TodoMVC), the developer doesn't need to explicitly specify data
    bindings. We've found this approach makes it easier to build apps.</p>
<h2 id="html-is-just-the-beginning">HTML is just the beginning.</h2>
<p>Because React has its own lightweight representation of the document, we can do some pretty cool things with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook has dynamic charts that render to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> instead of HTML.</li>
<li>Instagram is a "single page" web app built entirely with React and <code>Backbone.Router</code>. Designers regularly contribute React code with JSX.</li>
<li>We've built internal prototypes that run React apps in a web worker and use React to drive <strong>native iOS
        views</strong> via an Objective-C bridge.</li>
<li>You can run React <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/react-server-rendering-example">on the server</a> for SEO, performance, code sharing and overall flexibility.</li>
<li>Events behave in a consistent, standards-compliant way in all browsers (including IE8) and automatically use <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate">event delegation</a>.</li>
</ul>
