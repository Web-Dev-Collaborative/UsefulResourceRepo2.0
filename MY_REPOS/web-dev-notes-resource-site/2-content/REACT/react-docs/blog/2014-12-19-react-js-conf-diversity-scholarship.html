<p>Today I'm really happy to announce the React.js Conf Diversity Scholarship! We believe that a diverse set of
    viewpoints and opinions is really important to build a thriving community. In an ideal world, every part of the tech
    community would be made up of people from all walks of life. However the reality is that we must be proactive and
    make an effort to make sure everybody has a voice. As conference organizers we worked closely with the Diversity
    Team here at Facebook to set aside 10 tickets and provide a scholarship. 10 tickets may not be many in the grand
    scheme but we really believe that this will have a positive impact on the discussions we have at the conference.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about this and I hope you are too! The full announcement is below:</p>

<p>The Diversity Team at Facebook is excited to announce that we are now accepting applications for the React.js Conf scholarship!</p>
<p>Beginning today, those studying or working in computer science or a related field can apply for an all-expense paid
    scholarship to attend the React.js Conf at Facebook's Headquarters in Menlo Park, CA on January 28 &amp; 29, 2015.
    React opens a world of new possibilities such as server-side rendering, real-time updates, different rendering
    targets like SVG and canvas. Join us at React.js Conf to shape the future of client-side applications! For more
    information about the React.js conference, please see the <a href="http://conf.reactjs.com/">website</a> and <a
        href="/blog/2014/10/27/react-js-conf.html">previous</a> <a
        href="/blog/2014/11/24/react-js-conf-updates.html">updates</a> on our blog.</p>
<p>At Facebook, we believe that anyone anywhere can make a positive impact by developing products to make the world more open and connected to the people and things they care about. Given the current realities of the tech industry and the lack of representation of communities we seek to serve, applicants currently under-represented in Computer Science and related fields are strongly encouraged to apply. Facebook will make determinations on scholarship recipients in its sole discretion. Facebook complies with all equal opportunity laws.</p>
