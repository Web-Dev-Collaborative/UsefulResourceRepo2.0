<p>There have been many posts recently covering the <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> of React. This week's community round-up
    includes a collection of recent articles to help you get started with React, along with a few posts that explain
    some of the inner workings.</p>
<h2 id="react-in-a-nutshell">React in a nutshell</h2>
<p>Got five minutes to pitch React to your coworkers? John Lynch (<span class="citation" data-cites="johnrlynch">[@johnrlynch]</span>(https://twitter.com/johnrlynch)) put together <a href="http://slid.es/johnlynch/reactjs">this excellent and refreshing slideshow</a>:</p>

<h2 id="reacts-diff-algorithm">React's diff algorithm</h2>
React core team member Christopher Chedeau (<span class="citation"
    data-cites="vjeux">[@vjeux]</span>(https://twitter.com/vjeux)) explores the innards of React's tree diffing
algorithm in this <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/diff/">extensive and well-illustrated post</a>.

<p>While we're talking about tree diffing: Matt Esch (<span class="citation"
        data-cites="MatthewEsch">[@MatthewEsch]</span>(https://twitter.com/MatthewEsch)) created <a
        href="https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom">this project</a>, which aims to implement the virtual DOM and a
    corresponding diff algorithm as separate modules.</p>
<h2 id="many-many-new-introductions-to-react">Many, many new introductions to React!</h2>
<p>James Padosley wrote a short post on the basics (and merits) of React: <a
        href="http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/what-is-react/">What is React?</a> &gt; What I like most about React
    is that it doesn't impose heady design patterns and data-modelling abstractions on me. […] Its opinions are so
    minimal and its abstractions so focused on the problem of the DOM, that you can merrily slap your design choices
    atop. &gt; &gt; <a href="http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/what-is-react/">Read the full post…</a></p>
<p>Taylor Lapeyre (<span class="citation" data-cites="taylorlapeyre">[@taylorlapeyre]</span>(https://twitter.com/taylorlapeyre)) wrote another nice <a href="http://words.taylorlapeyre.me/an-introduction-to-react">introduction to React</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>React expects you to do the work of getting and pushing data from the server. This makes it very easy to implement React as a front end solution, since it simply expects you to hand it data. React does all the other work.</p>

The former includes a nice introduction to using JSX, while the latter focuses on adding interactivity and linking multiple components together. Also check out the <a href="https://medium.com/react-tutorials">other posts in his React Tutorial series</a>, e.g. on using <a href="https://medium.com/react-tutorials/8aaec65a546c">React + Backbone Model</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/react-tutorials/c00be0cf1592">React + Backbone Router</a>.</p>

[<a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/rFvZydtmsxM">part 1</a>], [<a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/5yvFLrt7N8M">part 2</a>]</p>
<h3 id="react-finally-a-great-serverclient-web-stack">"React: Finally, a great server/client web stack"</h3>
<p>Eric Florenzano (<span class="citation" data-cites="ericflo">[@ericflo]</span>(https://twitter.com/ericflo)) sheds some light on what makes React perfect for server rendering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the ideal solution would fully render the markup on the server, deliver it to the client so that it can be shown to the user instantly. Then it would asynchronously load some JavaScript that would attach to the rendered markup, and invisibly promote the page into a full app that can render its own markup. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What I've discovered is that enough of the pieces have come together, that this futuristic-sounding web environment
    is actually surprisingly easy to do now with React.js.</p>
