<h2 id="react-and-flux-at-forwardjs">React And Flux at ForwardJS</h2>
<p>Facebook engineers <a href="https://github.com/jingc">Jing Chen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fisherwebdev">Bill Fisher</a> gave a talk about Flux and React at <a href="http://forwardjs.com/">ForwardJS</a>, and how using an application architecture with a unidirectional data flow helped solve recurring bugs.</p>

<p><a href="https://spoike.ghost.io/">Mikael Brassman</a> wrote <a href="https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs">Reflux</a>, a library that implements Flux concepts. Note that it diverges significantly from the way we use Flux at Facebook. He explains <a href="https://spoike.ghost.io/deconstructing-reactjss-flux/">the reasons why in a blog post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="react-and-flux-interview">React and Flux Interview</h2>
<p><a href="http://ianobermiller.com/">Ian Obermiller</a>, engineer at Facebook, <a href="http://ianobermiller.com/blog/2014/09/15/react-and-flux-interview/">made a lengthy interview</a> on the experience of using React and Flux in order to build probably the biggest React application ever written so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've actually said this many times to my team too, I love React. It's really great for making these complex
    applications. One thing that really surprised me with it is that React combined with a sane module system like
    CommonJS, and making sure that you actually modulize your stuff properly has scaled really well to a team of almost
    10 developers working on hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of code.</p>
<p>Really, a fairly large code base… stuff just works. You don't have to worry about mutating, and the state of the DOM
    just really makes stuff easy. Just conceptually it's easier just to think about here's what I have, here's my data,
    here's how it renders, I don't care about anything else. For most cases that is really simplifying and makes it
    really fast to do stuff.</p>

<h2 id="async-requests-with-flux-revisited">Async Requests with Flux Revisited</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.code-experience.com/the-code-experience/">Reto Schläpfer</a> came back to a Flux project he
    hasn't worked on for a month and <a
        href="http://www.code-experience.com/async-requests-with-react-js-and-flux-revisited/">saw many ways to improve
        the way he implemented Flux</a>. He summarized his learnings in a blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The smarter way is to call the Web Api directly from an Action Creator and then make the Api dispatch an event with the request result as a payload. The Store(s) can choose to listen on those request actions and change their state accordingly.</p>
<p>Before I show some updated code snippets, let me explain why this is superior:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There should be only one channel for all state changes: The Dispatcher. This makes debugging easy because it just requires a single console.log in the dispatcher to observe every single state change trigger.</p></li>
<li><p>Asynchronously executed callbacks should not leak into Stores. The consequences of it are just too hard to fully foresee. This leads to elusive bugs. Stores should only execute synchronous code. Otherwise they are too hard to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding actions firing other actions makes your app simple. We use the newest Dispatcher implementation from Facebook that does not allow a new dispatch while dispatching. It forces you to do things right.</p></li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ameyakarve">Ameya Karve</a> explained how to use <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/mori">Mori</a>, a library that provides immutable data structures, in order to <a href="http://ameyakarve.com/jekyll/update/2014/02/06/Undo-React-Flux-Mori.html">implement undo-redo</a>.

        href="https://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/08/20/react-js-and-flux.html">he compares Backbone,
        Angular and Flux</a> on a simple example that's representative of a real project he worked on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, that was a bit more code! Well, try to think of it like this. In the above examples, if we were to do any changes to the application we would probably have to move things around. In the FLUX example we have considered that from the start.</p>
<p>Any changes to the application is adding, not moving things around. If you need a new store, just add it and make components dependant of it. If you need more views, create a component and use it inside any other component without affecting their current "parent controller or models".</p>

<h2 id="delorean-back-to-the-future">DeLorean: Back to the future!</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/deloreanjs/delorean">DeLorean</a> is a tiny Flux pattern implementation developed by <a href="https://github.com/f">Fatih Kadir Akin</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unidirectional data flow, it makes your app logic simpler than MVC</li>
<li>Automatically listens to data changes and keeps your data updated</li>
<li>Makes data more consistent across your whole application</li>
<li>It's framework agnostic, completely. There's no view framework dependency</li>
<li>Very small, just 4K gzipped</li>
<li>Built-in React.js integration, easy to use with Flight.js and Ractive.js and probably all others</li>
<li>Improve your UI/data consistency using rollbacks</li>
</ul>

If you build your app with flux, you can swap out React for a canvas or svg view layer and keep 85% of your code. (or the thing after React)
