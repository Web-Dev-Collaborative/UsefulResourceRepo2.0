<p>2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size <strong>React Server Components</strong>.</p>
<p>To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year.</p>

<p><strong>React Server Components are still in research and development.</strong> We are sharing this work in the
    spirit of transparency and to get initial feedback from the React community. There will be plenty of time for that,
    so <strong>don't feel like you have to catch up right now!</strong></p>
<p>If you want to check them out, we recommend to go in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Watch the talk</strong> to learn about React Server Components and see the demo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo">Clone the demo</a></strong> to play with React Server Components on your computer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188">Read the RFC (with FAQ at the end)</a></strong> for a deeper technical breakdown and to provide feedback.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are excited to hear from you on the RFC or in replies to the <span class="citation" data-cites="reactjs">[@reactjs]</span>(https://twitter.com/reactjs) Twitter handle. Happy holidays, stay safe, and see you next year!</p>
