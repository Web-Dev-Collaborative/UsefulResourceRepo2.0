<p>Create React App 2.0 has been released today, and it brings a year's worth of improvements in a single dependency
    update.</p>
<p>While React itself <a href="/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">doesn't require any build dependencies</a>, it can be
    challenging to write a complex app without a fast test runner, a production minifier, and a modular codebase. Since
    the very first release, the goal of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a> has
    been to help you focus on what matters the most – your application code – and to handle build and testing setup for
    you.</p>
<p>Many of the tools it relies on have since released new versions containing new features and performance improvements:
    <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0">Babel 7</a>, <a
        href="https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-released-today-6cdb994702d4">webpack 4</a>, and <a
        href="https://jestjs.io/blog/2018/05/29/jest-23-blazing-fast-delightful-testing.html">Jest 23</a>. However,
    updating them manually and making them work well together takes a lot of effort. And this is exactly what <a
        href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/graphs/contributors">Create React App 2.0 contributors</a>
    have been busy with for the past few months: <strong>migrating the configuration and dependencies so that you don't
        need to do it yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Now that Create React App 2.0 is out of beta, let's see what's new and how you can try it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't feel pressured to upgrade anything. If you're satisfied with the current feature set, its performance, and
    reliability, you can keep using the version you're currently at! It might also be a good idea to let the 2.0 release
    stabilize a little bit before switching to it in production.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="whats-new">What's New</h2>
<p>Here's a short summary of what's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>🎉 More styling options: you can use <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-sass-stylesheet">Sass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet">CSS Modules</a> out of the box.</li>
<li>🐠 We updated to <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0">Babel 7</a>, including support for the <a href="/docs/fragments.html#short-syntax">React fragment syntax</a> and many bugfixes.</li>
<li>📦 We updated to <a href="https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-released-today-6cdb994702d4">webpack 4</a>, which automatically splits JS bundles more intelligently.</li>
<li>🃏 We updated to <a href="https://jestjs.io/blog/2018/05/29/jest-23-blazing-fast-delightful-testing.html">Jest 23</a>, which includes an <a href="https://jestjs.io/blog/2018/05/29/jest-23-blazing-fast-delightful-testing#interactive-snapshot-mode">interactive mode</a> for reviewing snapshots.</li>
<li>💄 We added <a href="https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#stage-3">PostCSS</a> so you can use new CSS features in old browsers.</li>
<li>💎 You can use <a href="https://github.com/leoasis/graphql-tag.macro#usage">Apollo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/2171#issuecomment-411459604">Relay Modern</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5149#issuecomment-425396995">MDX</a>, and other third-party <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/11/zero-config-with-babel-macros">Babel Macros</a> transforms.</li>
<li>🌠 You can now <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files#adding-svgs">import an SVG as a React component</a>, and use it in JSX.</li>
<li>🐈 You can try the experimental <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101">Yarn Plug'n'Play mode</a> that
    removes <code>node_modules</code>.</li>
<li>🕸 You can now <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#configuring-the-proxy-manually">plug your own proxy implementation</a> in development to match your backend API.</li>
<li>🚀 You can now use <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/446#issuecomment-281014491">packages written for latest Node versions</a> without breaking the build.</li>
<li>✂️ You can now optionally get a smaller CSS bundle if you only plan to target modern browsers.</li>
<li>👷‍♀️ Service workers are now opt-in and are built using Google's <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/">Workbox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of these features work out of the box</strong> – to enable them, follow the below instructions.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-project-with-create-react-app-20">Starting a Project with Create React App 2.0</h2>
<p>You don't need to update anything special. Starting from today, when you run <code>create-react-app</code> it will
    use the 2.0 version of the template by default. Have fun!</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>use the old 1.x template</strong> for some reason, you can do that by passing <code>--scripts-version=react-scripts@1.x</code> as an argument to <code>create-react-app</code>.</p>
<h2 id="updating-a-project-to-create-react-app-20">Updating a Project to Create React App 2.0</h2>
<p>Upgrading a non-ejected project to Create React App 2.0 should usually be straightforward. Open <code>package.json</code> in the root of your project and find <code>react-scripts</code> there.</p>
<p>Then change its version to <code>2.0.3</code>:</p>
<pre class="js{2}"><code>  // ... other dependencies ...
  &quot;react-scripts&quot;: &quot;2.0.3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>npm install</code> (or <code>yarn</code>, if you use it). <strong>For many projects, this one-line change is sufficient to upgrade!</strong></p>

working here… thanks for all the new functionality 👍

</blockquote>
<p>Here are a few more tips to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>When you run <code>npm start</code> for the first time after the upgrade,</strong> you'll get a prompt asking
    about which browsers you'd like to support. Press <code>y</code> to accept the default ones. They'll be written to
    your <code>package.json</code> and you can edit them any time. Create React App will use this information to produce
    smaller or polyfilled CSS bundles depending on whether you target modern browsers or older browsers.</p>
<p><strong>If <code>npm start</code> still doesn't quite work for you after the upgrade,</strong> <a
        href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v2.0.3">check out the more detailed migration
        instructions in the release notes</a>. There <em>are</em> a few breaking changes in this release but the scope
    of them is limited, so they shouldn't take more than a few hours to sort out. Note that <strong><a
            href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md">support
            for older browsers</a> is now opt-in</strong> to reduce the polyfill size.</p>
<p><strong>If you previously ejected but now want to upgrade,</strong> one common solution is to find the commits where
    you ejected (and any subsequent commits changing the configuration), revert them, upgrade, and later optionally
    eject again. It's also possible that the feature you ejected for (maybe Sass or CSS Modules?) is now supported out
    of the box.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Due to a possible bug in npm, you might see warnings about unsatisfied peer dependencies. You should be able to
    ignore them. As far as we're aware, this issue isn't present with Yarn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>Here's a short list of breaking changes in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 6 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>Support for older browsers (such as IE 9 to IE 11) is now opt-in with a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-app-polyfill">separate package</a>.</li>
<li>Code-splitting with <code>import()</code> now behaves closer to specification, while <code>require.ensure()</code> is disabled.</li>
<li>The default Jest environment now includes jsdom.</li>
<li>Support for specifying an object as <code>proxy</code> setting was replaced with support for a custom proxy module.</li>
<li>Support for <code>.mjs</code> extension was removed until the ecosystem around it stabilizes.</li>
<li>PropTypes definitions are automatically stripped out of the production builds.</li>
</ul>
<p>If either of these points affects you, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v2.0.3">2.0.3 release notes</a> contain more detailed instructions.</p>
