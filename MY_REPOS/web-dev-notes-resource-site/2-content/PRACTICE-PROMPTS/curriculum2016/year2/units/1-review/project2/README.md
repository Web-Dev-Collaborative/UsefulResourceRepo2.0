#Unit Review: Project 2 || Foundations Review


##Scope
In this session volunteers may choose to revisit certain skills from the first year curriculum if they feel the class needs the refresher. Volunteers may choose which units (if any) need revisiting. **This project may be skipped if the volunteer team feels a refresher is not necessary for the class as a whole.**


##Estimated Completion Time
No more than two 120 minutes should be allocated to this project. 

##Year 1 Curriculum

* The 2015 ScriptEd Year 1 Curriculum can be found [here](github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015)   
* The 2016 ScriptEd Year 1 Curriculum can be found [here](github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2016) 

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Students have already seen the lessons in the 2015 curriculum. Teachers may use their discretion to give the same lesson they have seen last year or to approach a skill from a new lesson.
* Be very clear with the students in saying that in this advanced course we will move onto some awesome new skills. But for now we will fortify the concepts learned in year 1.
