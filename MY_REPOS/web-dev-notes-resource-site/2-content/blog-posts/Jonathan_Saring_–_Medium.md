Building a design system with components to standardize and scale our UI development process.

In this article, I will show and explain our process of creating a design system. I will share real examples every step of the way.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design systems were created to bring order into an inevitable entropy. The first design system was introduced by [NASA in 1976](https://blog.bitsrc.io/7-tools-for-building-your-design-system-in-2020-452d9c9b3b8e#:~:text=Legend%20has%20it%20that%20the,different%20teams%2C%20projects%20and%20applications.), and today nearly all large organizations [like Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb, or Shopify](https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-a-consistent-ui-design-system-4481fb37470f) have such a system to bring consistency into the chaos of more products and teams.

At [**Bit**](https://bit.dev/)**,** we build tools for 150,000+ developers working with components. Our platform helps developers build, share, and collaborate on components to speed up and improve web application development.

We enjoy a **Design System driven by Components.**

Over the past 2 years, we‚Äôve been ‚Äúdogfooding" our platform to build a design system‚Ä¶
