## Recommended Tools

### Code Editors/IDEs:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Free)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free, but there are currently problems with the Live Server. I no longer use it anymore.)

- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (what I have had for a long time and have switched back to it. It's fantastic, and a full blown Integrated Development Environment, aka IDE.) - it is not free, but for those of you that are serious about continuing to learn JavaScript, I highly recommend it. It is not expensive either. Check it out here: [Webstorm JavaScript IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
