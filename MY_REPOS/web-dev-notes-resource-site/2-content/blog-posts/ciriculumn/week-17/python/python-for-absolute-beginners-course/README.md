## What topics are covered

In this course, you will:

* Learn how to install Python and a proper editor to write code on your computer.
* See a quick, high-level overview of the *big ideas* of computer programming (e.g. data structures).
* Understand how Python executes a program and turns what you write into executable software.
* See how Python defines data types (integers, strings, etc.) and how to convert between them.
* Create interactive code that has a *conversation* with the user or data.
* Use functions to make your code more maintainable and reusable.
* Choose the right data structure to significantly improve the clarity and performance of your code.
* Create a basic AI / computer opponent for the games built during the course.
* Learn many problem solving techniques to help you dive right into writing code productively.
* See resources to help visualize connections between data created by your code.
* Work with multiple file formats to read and write data as our program runs.
* Use external libraries from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org).
* Add error handling to your application for a polished, reliable application.
* And lots more

## Who is this course for?

This course is for **anyone who wants to learn Python and computer programming**. If you haven't had a formal education in software development or have tried other courses and programming "didn't stick", then you are a great candidate student.

The student requirements are quite light for this course. You'll need:

* Basic typing skills
* Foundational computer experience (installing software etc.) 
* A simple computer (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
* A desire to learn programming

**Note**: All software used during this course, including editors, Python language, etc., are 100% free and open source. You won't have to buy anything to take the course.




## What games will we build?

I believe it's important to learn programming in the context of something that feels plausible and real. We won't build a bunch of disconnected loops and other programming examples that don't relate back to real programs. We  will build several fun games that cover meaningful content that any elementary 
Python course would cover.

1. **Guess the number of M&Ms in a jar**
2. **TIC-TAC-TOE**
3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors (3-way and 7-way)**
4. **A Connect4 clone**



## The time to act is now

If you've always wanted to learn programming and are considering Python as your gateway into that world, this is the course for you. We will fill in the concepts that would normally be covered in a CS 101 course without wasting your time taking semesters to cover what can be learned and practiced in a week or two.

Dive into Python and become a software developer with this course. Join today! You've got nothing to lose. Every one of our courses comes with a 2-week money-back guarantee.
