<h1 id="solutions-proceed-with-caution.">Solutions: Proceed with caution.</h1>
<p>We’ve decided to include the solutions to the practice exercises. Initially, the intention was to omit them. It can be frustrating. However, <strong>it’s working your way through that actually drives the learning</strong>. It feels good to see the solution, but to make it really click, you have to make it your own and work your way through it.</p>
<p>That said, a large number of students have requested that I add these and so here they are.</p>
<p>But, I want to you be sure you want to go down this path. Ideally, this is a <em>check my solution</em> type of thing. So we have made the steps a little bit manual. To see the solution, you have to check out the <code>with_solutions</code> branch. They do no appear in the default <code>master</code> branch (this one).</p>
<p>You can do this on GitHub by just using the branch dropdown like this:</p>
<p><img src="./resources/branches.png" /></p>
<p>Then you will see a solutions folder below this one.</p>
<p>Best of luck on the course, Michael!</p>
