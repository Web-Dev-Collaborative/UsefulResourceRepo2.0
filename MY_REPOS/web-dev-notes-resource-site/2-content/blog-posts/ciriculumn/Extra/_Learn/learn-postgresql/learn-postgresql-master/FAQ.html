<h2 id="why-postgresql-and-not-mysql">Why PostgreSQL and <em>Not</em> MySQL?</h2>
<p>The <em>good</em> news is that almost all of your PostgreSQL knowledge is <em>directly</em> transferable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>. Since <em>both</em> use SQL as the language for interacting with the database, the time you invest in learning PostgreSQL and building SQL skills is a hugely valuable.</p>
<p>Learning how to <em>run</em> means you also know how to <em>walk</em>. PostgreSQL might <em>feel</em> “more difficult” in the same way that , but the principals are all the same. Just stick with it and keep asking questions until it all “makes sense”. If you need to <em>apply</em> your SQL skills to MySQL, MS SQL or MariaDB, it will only take you a few minutes to adapt to it.</p>
<p>It’s very much like riding a bicycle. Once you know how to balance, pedal and steer, your skills transfer to other bicycles.</p>
<p>The <em>reason</em> MySQL is still <em>hugely</em> popular can be summarised by <em>one</em> word: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress"><strong><em>WordPress</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Over <strong>30%</strong> of the 10 million most popular websites use WordPress. WordPress runs on the “LAMP” (<em>Linux Apache <strong>MySQL</strong> PHP</em>) stack, which means that people are using MySQL by <em><code>default</code></em> not <em>conscious enlightenment</em>. + https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/stats + https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all</p>
<h2 id="why-not-use-wordpress">Why <em>Not</em> Use WordPress?</h2>
<p>WordPress is <em>unquestionably</em> a good CMS and blogging platform that helps millions of people/businesses publish online. Sadly, it’s not secure by <em>default</em> and when a vulnerability is discovered, it gets exploited en-mass very quickly. Yes, WordPress can be <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress">“Hardened”</a> but that is <em>usually</em> not the <em>first</em> thing on people’s todo list when launching a website or blog. The result is that <em>thousands</em> of WordPress websites get hacked each time a patch is released e.g: https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-wordpress-sites-backdoored-with-malicious-code and it creates a maintenance headache for the person/people <em>responsible</em> for the site. We’re not saying you (<em>or anyone else</em>) should not use WordPress, just make sure you follow the the latest “best practice” if you do. (<em>We have been “burned” by it through no fault of our own… and would not touch it again with a barge pole! There are <strong>much</strong> more <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>performant</strong> options!</em>)</p>
<h3 id="what-about-nosql-databasesdatastores-like-elasticsearch-and-redis">What About NoSQL Databases/Datastores Like ElasticSearch and Redis?</h3>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="dwyl">@dwyl</span> we are <em>huge</em> fans of <em>special-purpose</em> data storage/retrieval systems. We have used <em>several</em> NoSQL databases including CouchDB, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Neo4J and Redis. Of these we <em>recommend</em> ElasticSearch for full-text search and Redis for in-momory datasets and caching. see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elasticsearch">github.com/dwyl/learn-<strong>elasticsearch</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redis">github.com/dwyl/learn-<strong>redis</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>However as a “primary” datastore with a robust query language, we feel PostgreSQL is the <em>clear</em> winner as a “first” database.</p>
