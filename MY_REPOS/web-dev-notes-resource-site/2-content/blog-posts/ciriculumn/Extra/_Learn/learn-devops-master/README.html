<p>Learn the craft of “DevOps” (Developer Operations) to <em>easily/reliably</em> deploy your App and keep it Up!</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>You should learn more “advanced” DevOps if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You / your team have “out-grown” <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku">Heroku</a> (<em>e.g: your Heroku bill is more than $100/month</em>)</li>
<li>You want “more control” over your infrastructure e.g: to run a specific version of software or database.</li>
<li>Your client/boss has instructed you to use a <em>specific</em> “cloud” provider.</li>
<li>Curiosity to extend your “back end infrastructure” knowledge to be a more “well-rounded” developer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>DevOps integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating workflows and continuously measuring application performance.</em>” from: <a href="https://youtu.be/_I94-tJlovg">“<strong>What is DevOps</strong>?”</a> by RackSpace</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="who">Who?</h2>
<p>Everyone that wants to <em>seriously consider/call</em> themself a “<strong><em>Full Stack</em></strong>” <strong>Developer</strong> <strong><em>must</em></strong> know how to deploy, <em>secure</em> and <em>monitor</em> their app on their chosen infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<p>Over the years we <span class="citation" data-cites="dwyl">@dwyl</span> have deployed/managed Apps, both our own and those of our clients, on a wide variety of infrastructure and platform providers.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> of our Apps have been deployed to <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (“<strong>AWS</strong>”) e.g: https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk <br /> We have <em>several</em> clients who use (<em>and <strong>love</strong></em>) Heroku e.g: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org <br /> For the National Health Service (NHS) in England, (<em>who have a major contract with Microsoft</em>) we deployed https://www.healthlocker.uk to Azure. <br /> We have clients who still own their own “<em>Bare Metal</em>” Servers.</p>

<h3 id="testing-continuous-integration-delivery">Testing, Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery</h3>
<p>Deployment is what you do with your app once you have built, tested and documented it.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with Test-Driven Development (TDD), please see: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd <br /></p>
<p>Next you should be proficient with Continuous Integration. For that we recommend using Travis-CI, see: <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis">https://github.com/dwyl/<strong>learn-travis</strong></a></p>

<!--
### _First_ Upgrade Deployment

Build Upgrade based on the version currently on Staging:
```
mix edeliver build upgrade --auto-version=git-revision --from=$(1.0.3) --to=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --verbose --branch=continuous-delivery
```

Get the version that was created and use it as the `--version` in the next command:

```
mix edeliver deploy upgrade to production --version=1.0.3+3a4f948 --verbose
```


> _**NOTE**: We have an **Open issue** for deploying an **UPGRADE**
via Continuous Integration:_ https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops/issues/19 <br />
> _We requested help on:_ https://github.com/edeliver/edeliver/issues/234 <br />
> _But sadly, no reply, yet ..._
_if you have time to help please comment on the issue!_

## <sup>1</sup>Why Not "_Just Use Heroku_"?

Heroku is great for _most_ use-cases.
But it gets _expensive_ very quickly!
The moment you start to pay for an app it's $7/month
(_which may not sound "expensive" on the surface_)
But it's the _Database_ that's the _expensive_ part!

### Heroku Database _Extortion_

The moment you go beyond the "_hobby_" plan:
![heroku-hobby-dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/28563894-543876d8-711f-11e7-9b09-cb548e10ee84.png)

![heroku-hobby-basic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/28563938-77966842-711f-11e7-9668-eaa694325a79.png)

![heroku-database-pricing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/28563258-4e7628d2-711d-11e7-81e0-b3997d9d05ca.png)

As you can see, from the pricing, the _resources_ do offer value-for money
once the project's database goes above a certain size.
