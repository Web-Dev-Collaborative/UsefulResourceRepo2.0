<p>Every programming language has features that distinguish it from the rest of the pack. The heavy usage of callbacks is one such pattern that characterizes JavaScript. We pass callbacks as arguments as a way to execute a series of commands at a later time. However, what happens if there is no guarantee exactly <em>when</em> that callback is executed? We’ve explored callbacks extensively thus far in the course, but it’s time to add another wrinkle - how can we utilize callbacks <em>asynchronously</em>?</p>
<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code</li>
<li>Give one example illustrating why we would need to deal with asynchronous code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synchronous-vs-asynchronous-code">Synchronous vs asynchronous code</h2>
<p>Let’s begin by exploring the difference between <strong>synchronous</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong> code. Luckily, you are already familiar with the former. In fact, all of the code you have written thus far in the course has been synchronous.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous">Synchronous</h3>
<p>If code is <strong>synchronous</strong>, that means that there is an inherent order among the commands and this order of execution is <em>guaranteed</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of synchronous code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;one&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;two&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;three&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This seems trivial, but it is important to recognize. It is guaranteed that ‘one’ will be printed before ‘two’ and ‘two’ will be printed before ‘three’. Taking this a step further, you also know that the order of execution may not always simply be the positional order of the lines in the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> foo <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;two&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" title="5"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;one&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" title="6"><span class="at">foo</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" title="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;three&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the command <code>console.log("two")</code> appears before <code>console.log("one")</code> in terms of the line numbers of the script, we know that this code will still print ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ because we understand the rules of JavaScript evaluation. Although the execution may jump around to different line numbers as we call and return from functions, the above code is still synchronous. The above code is synchronous because we can predict with total certainty the relative order of the print statements.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous">Asynchronous</h3>
<p>If code is <strong>asynchronous</strong>, that means that there is no guarantee in the total order that commands are executed. Asynchronous is the opposite of synchronous.</p>
<p>Since this is our first encounter with asynchronicity, we’ll need to introduce a new function to illustrate this behavior. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout">setTimeout</a> method will execute a callback after a given amount of time. We can pass a callback and an amount of time in milliseconds as arguments to the method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;time is up!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">1500</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we execute the above code, ‘time is up!’ will be print after about one and a half seconds. Paste the above code to a <code>.js</code> file and execute it to see this behavior for yourself!</p>
<p>Let’s add some other print statements into the mix:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;start&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" title="4">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;time is up!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" title="5"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">1500</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-7" title="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;end&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we execute the above snippet, we will see the output in this order inside of our terminal:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>start
end
time is up!</code></pre>
<p>Surprised? Although we call the function <code>setTimeout</code>, it does not block execution of the lines after it (like <code>console.log("end")</code>). That is, while the timer ticks down for the <code>setTimeout</code> we will continue to execute other code. This is because <code>setTimeout</code> is <strong>asynchronous</strong>!</p>
<h4 id="cant-believe-its-async">Can’t believe it’s async?</h4>
<p>The healthy skeptic may notice that we defined the term <em>asynchronous</em> code as code where there is no guaranteed order among its commands - but, couldn’t we just specify timeout periods such that we <em>could</em> orchestrate some order to the code? The skeptic may write the following code arguing that we can predict a print order of ‘first’ then ‘last’:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" title="1"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;last&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" title="3"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">3000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-5" title="5"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-6" title="6">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;first&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-7" title="7"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">1000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Surely if we wait 3 seconds for ‘last’ and only 1 second for ‘first’, then we’ll see ‘first’ then ‘last’, right? By providing sufficiently large timeout periods, hasn’t the skeptic proven <code>setTimeout</code> to be synchronous?</p>
<p>The answer is a resounding <strong>no; we cannot treat <code>setTimeout</code> as synchronous under any circumstance</strong>. The reason is that the time period specified to <code>setTimeout</code> is not exact, rather it is the <em>minimum</em> amount of time that will elapse before executing the callback (cue the title of this article). If we set a timeout with 3 seconds, then we could wait 3 seconds, or 3.5 seconds, or even 10 seconds before the callback is invoked. If there is no guaranteed timing, then it is asynchronous. The following snippet illustrates this concept succinctly:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;first&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-3" title="3"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-4" title="4">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;second&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-5" title="5"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-7" title="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;third&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This would print the following order:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>first
third
second</code></pre>
<p>Although we specify a delay of 0 milliseconds, the callback is not invoked immediately, because the actual delay may be more than 0. This unintuitive behavior is well known, in fact there is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout#Reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified">full section in the docs for setTimeout</a> devoted to this nuance. The reasons for this discrepancy are not important for now. However, do take away the fact that <code>setTimeout</code> is indeed asynchronous, no matter how hard we try to fight it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout">setTimeout</a> is just one example of asynchronous behavior. Another asynchronous function is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval</a>, which will continually execute a callback after a number of milliseconds, repeatedly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-asynchronous-code">Why do we need asynchronous code?</h2>
<p>We know how you are feeling. Asynchronous code seems intimidating. Before this article, you’ve written exclusively synchronous code and have gotten quite far using just that - so why do we need asynchronous code? The truth of the matter is that the environment in which we run our applications is full of uncertainty; there is seldom a guarantee of when actions occur, how long they will take, or even if they will happen at all. A software engineer can write the code, but they can’t write the circumstances in which their code will run (we can dream). Here are a few practical scenarios where asynchronous code is a necessity:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we request data from an external server over a network, we cannot predict when we will get receive a response back. The timing is susceptible to latency due to the amount of traffic on the network, the server being busy handling other requests, and much more.</li>
<li>When we expect a user to interact with our programs by hitting a key, clicking a button, or scrolling down the page, we can never be certain when they will perform those actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a few problems that we will encounter in upcoming lessons and we’ll turn to asynchronous JavaScript for the solution!</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>In this reading, we’ve introduced asynchronous code. In particular we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>explored the difference between synchronous and asynchronous with <code>setTimeout</code> as our asynchronous candidate</li>
<li>identified asynchronous code as a solution to handle timing circumstances during our programs’ runtime that we cannot predict with total certainty</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="all-in-good-time-setting-timeouts-and-intervals">All in Good Time: Setting Timeouts and Intervals</h1>
<p>During our introduction to asynchronicity, we used <code>setTimeout</code> as a prime example of a function that exhibits asynchronous behavior. We’ll turn time and time again to <code>setTimeout</code> in order to illustrate asynchronous concepts. Because of this, let’s familiarize ourselves with all the ways we can use the function!</p>
<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>name the arguments that can be passed to <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code></li>
<li>predict the asynchronous nature of code snippets that utilize <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code></li>

<h2 id="time-out-what-are-the-arguments">Time-out! What are the arguments?</h2>
<p>In it’s most basic usage, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout">setTimeout</a> function accepts a callback and an amount of time in milliseconds. Open a new <code>.js</code> file and execute the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;food&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-5" title="5"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above will print out ‘food’ after waiting about two seconds. We previously explored this behavior, but it’s worth reemphasizing. <code>setTimeout</code> is asynchronous, so any commands that come after the <code>setTimeout</code> may be executed before the callback is called:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;food&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-5" title="5"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-6" title="6"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;drink&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above will print out ‘drink’ first and then ‘food’. You may hear asynchronous functions like <code>setTimeout</code> referred to as “non-blocking” because they don’t prevent the code that follows their invocation from running. It’s also worth mentioning that the time amount argument for <code>setTimeout</code> is optional. If no amount is specified, then the amount will default to zero (<code>setTimeout(foo)</code> is equivalent to <code>setTimeout(foo, 0</code>). Embellishing on this thought for a moment, a common JavaScript developer interview question asks candidates to predict the print order of the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;food&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-5" title="5"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-6" title="6"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;drink&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above will will print out ‘drink’ first and then ‘food’. This is because <code>setTimeout</code> is asynchronous so it will not block execution of further lines. We have also previously mentioned that the amount specified is the minimum amount of time that will be waited, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout#Reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified">sometimes the delay will be longer</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the callback and delay amount, an unlimited number of additional arguments may be provided. After the delay, the callback will be called with those provided arguments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>(food1<span class="op">,</span> food2) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(food1 <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot; for breakfast&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(food2 <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot; for lunch&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-6" title="6"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2000</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;pancakes&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;couscous&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above will print the following after about two seconds:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>pancakes for breakfast
couscous for lunch</code></pre>
<h2 id="cancelling-timeouts">Cancelling timeouts</h2>
<p>You now have complete knowledge of all possible arguments we can use for <code>setTimeout</code>, but what does it return? If we executing the following snippet in node:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;food&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-5" title="5"><span class="kw">const</span> val <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-6" title="6"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(val)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll see that the return value of <code>setTimeout</code> is some special <code>Timeout</code> object:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-1" title="1">Timeout <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-14" title="14"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You won’t be finding this object too useful except for one thing, cancelling an timeout that has yet to expire! We can pass this object into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearTimeout">clearTimeout</a> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;food&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-5" title="5"><span class="kw">const</span> val <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">setTimeout</span>(foo<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-6" title="6"><span class="at">clearTimeout</span>(val)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above will not print out anything because the <code>setTimeout</code> is cleared before the timer expires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may notice that the MDN documentation for <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>clearTimeout</code> show that <code>setTimeout</code> returns a simple id number that can be used to cancel a pending timeout and not a fancy Timeout object as we have described. This variation is due to the fact that we are executing our code with NodeJS and not in the browser (MDN is specific to the browser environment). Rest assured, in either environment, if you pass the data that is returned from <code>setTimeout</code> to <code>clearTimeout</code>, the timeout will be cancelled!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-intervals">Running Intervals</h2>
<p>Similar to <code>setTimeout</code>, there also exists a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval</a> that function that executes a callback repeatedly at the specified delay. <code>setInterval</code> accepts the same arguments as <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>(food1<span class="op">,</span> food2) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(food1 <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot; and &quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> food2 <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>The code above will print out ‘pancakes and couscous!’ every second. Someone’s hungry! Like you would expect, there is also a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval">clearInterval</a> that we can use to cancel an interval!</p>

<h1 id="hanging-by-a-single-thread-a-yarn-on-javascripts-execution">Hanging by a Single Thread: A Yarn on JavaScript’s Execution</h1>
<p>The primary job of the programmer is to write code and to that end you have written hundreds, possibly thousands of lines so far. However, it is important for a programmer to understand the bigger picture. After we finish writing the code, what should we do with it? Publish it in a book? Print it to frame on wall? None of these. After we write the code, we run it! If writing code is the birth of a program, then its execution is the lifetime that takes place after. A lifetime full of highs and lows; some expected events and some unexpected. Instead of “lifetime”, programmers use the word “runtime” to refer to the execution of a program.</p>
<p>Let’s take a peek under the hood of the JavaScript runtime environment to get a glimpse at how the code we write is processed.</p>
<p>When you finish reading this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain the difference between <em>single-threaded</em> and <em>multi-threaded</em> execution</li>
<li>identify JavaScript as a <em>single-threaded</em> language</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-threaded-vs-multi-threaded-execution">Single-threaded vs multi-threaded execution</h2>
<p>In programming, we use the term <em>thread of execution</em> (<em>thread</em> for short) to describe a sequence of commands. A thread consists of well-ordered commands in the same way that a task may consist of multiple steps. For example, the task (thread) of doing laundry may consist of the following steps (commands):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>open the washing machine door</li>
<li>load the washing machine with clothes</li>
<li>add some detergent</li>
<li>close the washing machine door</li>
<li>turn the washing machine on</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part, the relative order of these steps is critical to the task. For example, we can only load the clothes after opening the door and <em>should</em> only turn the machine on after closing the door.</p>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of what a <em>thread</em> is, let’s use a similar analogy to explore two different models of threading. Enter <em>Appetite Academy</em>, the restaurant where patrons only have to pay the bill once they are full.</p>
<p>We’ll be exploring these two models:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/threading.png" alt="single-vs-multi-threading" /><figcaption>single-vs-multi-threading</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="single-threaded">Single-threaded</h3>
<p>In <strong>single-threaded</strong> execution, only one command can be processed at a time.</p>
<p>Say that a patron at Appetite Academy ordered a three course meal including a salad (appetizer), a burger (main entree), and a pie (dessert). Each dish has its own steps to be made. If the restaurant had a single-threaded kitchen, we might see one chef in the kitchen preparing each dish one after the other. To ensure that the customer receives the dishes in order, the lone chef would likely plate a dish fully before beginning preparation of the next dish. A shortcoming of this single chef kitchen is that the customer may have to wait some time between dishes. On the flip side, only employing one chef is cheap for the restaurant. Having one chef also keeps the kitchen relatively simple; multiple chefs may complicate things. With one chef the restaurant avoids any confusion that can result from “too many cooks in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Similar to having a single chef in the kitchen, <strong>JavaScript is a single-threaded language.</strong> This means at any instance in time during a program, only one command is being executed.</p>
<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>
<p>In <strong>multi-threaded</strong> execution, multiple commands can be processed at the same time.</p>
<p>If Appetite Academy had a multi-threaded kitchen, it would be quite a different scene. We might find three different chefs, each working on a different dish. This would likely cut down on the amount of time the customer spends waiting for dishes. This seems like a big enough reason to prefer multi-threading, but it’s not without tradeoffs. Employing more chefs would increase costs. Furthermore, the amount of time that is saved may not be as large as we think. If the chefs have to share resources like a single sink or single stove, then they would have to wait for those resources to be freed up before continuing preparation of their respective dishes. Finally, having multiple chefs can increase the complexity inside of the kitchen; the chefs will have to painstakingly communicate and coordinate their actions. If we don’t orchestrate our chefs,then they might fight over the stove or mistakenly serve the dishes in the wrong order!</p>
<p>A thread (chef) can still only perform one command at a time, but with many threads we could save some time by performing some steps in parallel across many threads.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-the-thread-from-unraveling">Keeping the thread from unraveling</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve identified JavaScript as a single-threaded language, let’s introduce a problem that all single-threaded runtimes must face. If we can only execute a single command at a time, what happens if we are in the process of carrying out a command and an “important” event occurs that we want to handle immediately? For example, if the user of our program presses a key, we would want to handle their input as quickly as possible in order to provide a smooth, snappy experience. The JavaScript runtime’s solution to this is quite simple: the user will have to wait. If a command is in progress and some event occurs, the current command will run to full completion before the event is handled. If the current command takes a long time, too bad; you’ll have to wait longer. Cue the very frustrating “We’re sorry, the page has become unresponsive” message you may be familiar with.</p>
<p>Execute the following snippet to illustrate this behavior:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" title="1"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;times up!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-3" title="3"><span class="op">},</span> <span class="dv">1000</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-5" title="5"><span class="kw">let</span> i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-6" title="6"><span class="cf">while</span> (<span class="kw">true</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-7" title="7">  i<span class="op">++;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-8" title="8"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The above program will hang indefinitely, never printing ‘times up!’ (press <code>ctrl/cmd + c</code> in your terminal to kill the program). Let’s break this down. When the program begins, we set a timeout for one second, then enter an infinite loop. While the loop is running, the timer expires, triggering a timeout event. However, JavaScript’s policy for handling new events is to only handle the next event <em>after</em> the current command is complete. Since the current command is an infinite loop, the current command will <em>never</em> complete, so the timeout event will <em>never</em> be handled.</p>
<p>Although this example seems contrived, it highlights one of the primary causes of slow, unresponsive pages. Up next, we’ll take a closer look at this issue and how we can mitigate it.</p>

<h1 id="stacking-the-odds-in-our-favor-the-call-stack">Stacking the Odds in our Favor: the Call Stack</h1>
<p>We’ve written a lot of programs so far in this course and sometimes they are quite complex. They may be complex in their execution since function calls and returns cause control flow to jump around to different lines, instead of just sequentially by increasing line number. Ever wonder how the JavaScript runtime is able to track all of those function calls? You’re in luck! It’s time to explore an important component of the JavaScript runtime: the <strong>call stack</strong>.</p>
<p>When you finish reading this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the two operations that characterize a <strong>stack</strong> data structure</li>
<li>sketch how the <strong>call stack</strong> is manipulated during the runtime of a simple program like the one provided in this reading</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The call stack</h2>
<p>The <strong>call stack</strong> is a structure that JavaScript uses to keep track of the evaluation of function calls. It uses the <strong>stack</strong> data structure. In Computer Science, a “stack” is a general pattern of organizing a collection of items. For our current use of a stack, the items being organized are the function calls that occur during the execution of our program. We’ll be exploring stacks in great detail further in the course. For now, we can imagine a stack as a vertical pile that obeys the following pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>new items must be placed on top of the pile - we refer to this as <strong>pushing</strong> a new item to the stack</li>
<li>at any point, the only item that can be removed is the top of the pile - we refer to this as <strong>popping</strong> the top item from the stack</li>
</ul>
<p>In JavaScript’s call stack, we use the term “stack frames” to describe the items that are being pushed and popped. With this new understanding, we can now identify two ways that JavaScript leverages these stack mechanics during runtime:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack.</li>
<li>when a function returns, the frame on the top of the stack is popped off the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate how frames are pushed and popped to the call stack, we’ll explore the following program:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">foo</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>Create a file for yourself and execute this code. It will print out the letters in order. This code is a great example of how a program’s execution may not simply be top down. Instead of executing sequentially, line by line, we know that function calls and returns will cause execution to hop back and forth to different line numbers. Let’s trace through this program, visualizing the stack. We’ll use a commented arrow to denote where we pause execution to visualize the stack at that moment.</p>
<p>We begin by executing a function call, <code>foo()</code>. This will add a frame to the stack:</p>

</figure>
<p>Now that <code>foo()</code> is the topmost (and only) frame on the stack, we must execute the code inside of that function definition. This means that we print ‘a’ and call <code>bar()</code>. This causes a new frame to be pushed to the stack:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/stack-trace/02.png" alt="stack-trace-image-2" /><figcaption>stack-trace-image-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the stack frame for <code>foo()</code> is still on the stack, but not on top anymore. The only time a frame may entirely leave that stack is when it is popped due to a function return. Bear in mind that a function can return due to a explicit return with a literal line like <code>return someValue;</code> or it can implicitly return after the last line of the function’s definition is executed. Since <code>bar()</code> is now on top of the stack, execution jumps into the definition of <code>bar</code>. You may notice the trick now: the frame that is at the top of the stack represents the function being executed currently. Back to the execution, we print ‘b’ and call <code>baz()</code>:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Again, notice that <code>bar()</code> remains on the stack because that function has not yet returned. Executing <code>baz</code>, we print out ‘c’ and return because there is no other code in the definition of <code>baz</code>. This return means that <code>baz()</code> is popped from the stack:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Now <code>bar()</code> is back on top of the stack; this makes sense because we must continue to execute the remaining code within <code>bar</code> on line 10:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>‘d’ is printed out and <code>bar</code> returns because there is no further code within its definition. The top of stack is popped. <code>foo()</code> is now on top, which means execution resumes inside of <code>foo</code>, line 4:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/stack-trace/06.png" alt="stack-trace-image-6" /><figcaption>stack-trace-image-6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, ‘e’ is printed and <code>foo</code> returns. This means the top frame is popped, leaving the stack empty. Once the stack is empty, our program can exit:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>That completes our stack trace! Here are three key points to take away from these illustrations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the frame on the top of the stack corresponds to the function currently being executed</li>
<li>calling a function will push a new frame to the top of the stack</li>
<li>returning from a function will pop the top frame from the stack</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a high level overview of the call stack. There is some detail that we’ve omitted to bring attention to the most important mechanics. In particular, we’ve glazed over what information is actually stored inside of a single stack frame. For example, a stack frame will contain data about a specific function call such as local variables, arguments, and which line to return to after the frame is popped!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-practical-consequences-of-the-call-stack">The practical consequences of the call stack</h2>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of the call stack, let’s discuss its practical implications. We’ve previously identified JavaScript as a single-threaded language and now you know why that’s the case. The use of a single call stack leads to a single thread of execution! The JavaScript runtime can only perform one “command” at a time and the one “command” currently being executed is whatever is at the top of the stack.</p>
<p>In the example program we just traced through, we mentioned that the program will exit once the call stack is empty. This is not true of all programs. If a program is asynchronously listening for an event to occur, such as waiting for a <code>setTimeout</code> to expire, then the program will not exit. In this scenario, once the <code>setTimeout</code> timer expires, a stack frame corresponding to the <code>setTimeout</code> callback will be added to the stack. From here, the call stack would be processed in the way we previously explored. Imagine that we had the same functions as before, but we called <code>foo</code> asynchronously:</p>

<p>The critical behavior to be aware of in the JavaScript runtime is this: <strong>an event can only be handled once the call stack is empty</strong>. Recall that events can be things other than timeouts, such as the user clicking a button or hitting a key. Because we don’t want to delay the handling of such important events, we want minimize the amount of time that the call stack is non-empty. Take this extreme scenario:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">somethingTerrible</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-8" title="8"><span class="at">setTimeout</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-9" title="9">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;time to do something really important!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-12" title="12"><span class="at">somethingTerrible</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>somethingTerrible()</code> will be pushed to the call stack and loop infinitely, causing the function to never return. We expect the <code>setTimeout</code> timer to expire while <code>somethingTerrible()</code> is still on the stack. Since <code>somethingTerrible()</code> never returns, it will never be popped from the stack, so our <code>setTimeout</code> callback will never have its own turn to be executed on the stack.</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned-3">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>In this reading, we have:</p>

<h1 id="an-unexpected-turn-of-events-the-event-loop-and-message-queue">An Unexpected Turn of Events: the event loop and Message Queue</h1>
<p>As of late, we’ve begun to uncover the asynchronous potential of JavaScript and how we can harness that potential to handle unpredictable events that occur during our application’s runtime. JavaScript is the tool that enables web pages to be interactive and dynamic. For example, if we head to a site like <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">appacademy.io</a> and click a button in the header, the page changes due to that click event. We can click on that button <em>whenever</em> we want and somehow JavaScript is able to handle it <em>asynchronously</em>. How exactly does JavaScript handle these events?</p>
<p>When you finish reading this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain how the JavaScript runtime uses the <em>call stack</em> and <strong>message queue</strong> in its <strong>event loop</strong></li>
<li>identify the two operations that characterize a <strong>queue</strong> data structure</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-event-loop">The event loop</h2>
<p>JavaScript uses an <strong>event loop</strong> model of execution. We’ve previously been introduced to one component of the event loop, the <em>call stack</em>. We identified the call stack as the structure used to keep track of the execution of function calls. Think of the call stack as keeping track of the current “task” in progress. To clarify, a single task may consist of multiple function calls. For example if a function <code>foo</code> calls function <code>bar</code> and <code>bar</code> calls function <code>baz</code>, then we consider all three functions as making progress toward the same task.</p>
<p>Along with the call stack, the event loop also consists of a <strong>message queue</strong>. While the call stack tracks the task that is currently in progress, the message queue keeps track of tasks that cannot be executed at this moment, but will be executed once the current task is finished (recall that tasks can only be performed one at a time because JavaScript is single-threaded). Because of this, you may hear JavaScript’s execution pattern referred to as “run to completion”. That is, the execution of an ongoing task will never be interrupted by another task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some other programming languages, it is possible for an ongoing task to be preempted or interrupted by another task, but this is not the case in JavaScript</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-message-queue">The message queue</h3>
<p>The message queue is a structure used to track the handling of events. It uses the <strong>queue</strong> data structure. A “queue” is a general pattern of organizing a collection of things. A real world example of a queue is the line that you wait on for checkout at a grocery store. A queue has a front and back, and obeys the following pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>new items are added to the back of queue - we refer to this as <strong>enqueueing</strong> an item</li>
<li>items can only leave through the front of the queue - we refer to this as <strong>dequeueing</strong> an item</li>
</ul>
<p>Events in JavaScript are handled asynchronously with callbacks. Like always, the events can be things such as a <code>setTimeout</code> expiring or the user clicking a button. The items stored on the message queue correspond to events that have occurred but have not yet been processed. The items stored on the queue are referred to as “messages”.</p>
<p>To illustrate how the message queue and call stack interact, we’ll trace the runtime of the following program:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">somethingSlow</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>The message queue only grows substantially when the current task takes a nontrivial amount of time to complete. If the runtime isn’t already busy tending to a task, then new messages can be processed immediately because they wait little to no time on the queue. For our illustration, we’ll take creative liberty and assume that some messages <em>do</em> have to wait on the queue because the <code>somethingSlow</code> function takes 4000 milliseconds to complete! We’ll use absolute time in milliseconds to tell our story in the following diagrams, but the reality is that we can’t be certain of the actual timing. The absolute time in milliseconds is not important, instead focus your attention to the relative order of the stack and queue manipulations that take place.</p>
<p>We begin by setting a timeout for both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> with 1500 and 1000 ms respectively. Apart from the stack frames for the calls to the <code>setTimeout</code> function itself (which we’ll ignore for simplicity), no items are added to the stack or queue. We don’t manipulate the queue because a new message is only enqueued when an event occurs and our timeout events have not yet triggered. We don’t add <code>foo()</code> or <code>bar()</code> to the stack because they are only called after their timeout events have triggered. However, we do add <code>somethingSlow()</code> to the stack because it is called synchronously. Imagine we are at about the 500 ms mark, <code>somethingSlow()</code> is being processed on the stack, while our two timeout events have not yet triggered:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/01.png" alt="event-loop-image-01" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-01</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the 1000 ms mark, <code>somethingSlow()</code> is still being processed on the stack because it needs a total of 4000 ms to return. However, at this moment, the timeout event for <code>bar</code> will trigger. Because there is something still on the stack, <code>bar</code> cannot be executed yet. Instead, it must wait on the queue:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/02.png" alt="event-loop-image-02" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-02</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the 1500 ms mark, a similar timeout event will occur for <code>foo</code>. Since new messages are enqueued at the back of the queue, the message for the <code>foo</code> event will wait behind our existing <code>bar</code> message. This is great because once the call stack becomes available to execute the next message, we ought to execute the message for the event that happened first! It’s first come, first serve:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/03.png" alt="event-loop-image-03" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-03</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Jumping to the 4000 ms mark, <code>somethingSlow()</code> finally returns and is popped from the call stack. The stack is now available to process the next message. The message at the front of the queue, <code>bar</code>, is placed on the stack for evaluation:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/04.png" alt="event-loop-image-04" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-04</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the 4100 ms mark, <code>bar()</code> execution is in full swing. We have just printed “bark” to the console and <code>baz()</code> is called. This new call for <code>baz()</code> is pushed to the stack.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/05.png" alt="event-loop-image-05" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-05</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You may have noticed that <code>baz</code> never had to wait on the queue; it went directly to the stack. This is because <code>baz</code> is called synchronously during the execution of <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>At the 4200 ms mark, <code>baz()</code> has printed “bazaar” to the console and returns. This means that the <code>baz()</code> stack frame is popped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/06.png" alt="event-loop-image-06" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-06</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the 4250 ms mark, execution resumes inside of <code>bar()</code> but there is no other code to evaluate inside. The function returns and <code>bar()</code> is popped. Now that the stack is free, the next message is taken from the queue to evaluate:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/07.png" alt="event-loop-image-07" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-07</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, “food” is printed and the stack is popped. Leaving us with an empty call stack and message queue:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/event-loop/08.png" alt="event-loop-image-08" /><figcaption>event-loop-image-08</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That’s all there is to it! Tracing the call stack and message queue for more complex programs is very tedious, but the underlying mechanics are the same. To summarize, synchronous tasks are performed on the stack. While the current task is being processed on the stack, incoming asynchronous events wait on the queue. The queue ensures that events which occurred first will be handled before those that occurred later. Once the stack is empty, that means the current task is complete, so the next task can be moved from the queue to the stack for execution. This cycle repeats again and again, hence the <em>loop</em>!</p>

<h1 id="reading-between-the-lines-getting-user-input-and-callback-chaining">Reading Between the Lines: Getting User Input and Callback Chaining</h1>
<p>Up until this point, our programs have been deterministic in that they exhibit the same behavior whenever we execute them. In order to change the behavior, we have had to change the code. The human element has been missing! It would be great if a user of our program could interact with it during <em>runtime</em>, possibly influencing the <em>thread of execution</em>. Gathering input from the user during runtime is an operation that is typically handled <em>asynchronously</em> with <em>events</em>. Why asynchronously? Well, we can’t be certain <em>when</em> the user will decide to interact and we don’t want our program to wait around idly for their input. Don’t forget that JavaScript is single-threaded; waiting for user input synchronously would block the thread!</p>
<p>When you finish reading this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a program that accepts user input using Node’s <code>readline</code> module</li>
<li>utilize callback chaining to guarantee relative order of execution among multiple asynchronous functions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nodes-readline-module">Node’s readline module</h2>
<p>To take user input, we’ll need to get acquainted with the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_readline">readline</a> module. Recall that a module is just a package of JavaScript code that provides some useful functionality (for example, <code>mocha</code> is a module that we have been using frequently to test our code). Luckily, the <code>readline</code> module already comes bundled with Node. No additional installations are needed, we just need to “import” the module into our program. Let’s begin with a fresh <code>.js</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-1" title="1"><span class="co">// import the readline module into our file</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> readline <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;readline&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>readline</code> variable is an object that contains all of the methods we can use from the module. Following the quick-start instructions in the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_readline">docs</a>, we’ll also need to do some initial setup:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> readline <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;readline&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-3" title="3"><span class="co">// create an interface where we can talk to the user</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-4" title="4"><span class="kw">const</span> rl <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">readline</span>.<span class="at">createInterface</span>(<span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-5" title="5">  <span class="dt">input</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">process</span>.<span class="at">stdin</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-6" title="6">  <span class="dt">output</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">process</span>.<span class="at">stdout</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The details of what <code>createInterface</code> does aren’t super-duper important, but here is the short story: it allows us to read and print information from the terminal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large part of using modules like <code>readline</code> is sifting through the documentation for what you need. You’ll have to become comfortable with utilizing methods without understanding exactly <em>how</em> they work. Abstraction is the name of the game here! We don’t know exactly how the <code>createInterface</code> method works under the hood, but we can still use it effectively because the docs offer examples and guidance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have the setup out of the way, let’s ask the user something! Referencing the docs, we can use the <code>question</code> method on our interface:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> readline <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;readline&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>Execute the code above and enter something when prompted! If we respond ‘nothing much’, the total output would be:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>What&#39;s up, doc? nothing much
you responded: nothing much</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? Notice that the <code>question</code> method accepts two arguments: a question message to display and a callback. When the user types a response and hits <code>enter</code>, the callback will be executed with their response as the argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rl.close() is invoked after the question is answered to close the interface. If we don’t close the interface, then the program will hang and not exit. In general, you’ll want to close the interface after you are done asking all of your questions. Like usual, all of this info is provided in the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_close">docs</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s emphasize a critical point: the <code>question</code> method is asynchronous! Similar to how we illustrated the asynchronous nature of <code>setTimeout</code>, let’s add a print statement after we call <code>rl.question</code>:</p>

<p>If we respond ‘nothing much’, the total output would be:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>What&#39;s up, doc? DONE!
nothing much
you responded: nothing much</code></pre>
<p>Oops. It looks like the ‘DONE!’ message was printed out before the user finished entering their response because the <code>question</code> method is asynchronous. We’ll introduce a pattern for overcoming this issue next.</p>
<h2 id="callback-chaining">Callback chaining</h2>
<p>In our last example, we saw how the asynchronous behavior of the <code>question</code> method can lead to issues if we want to perform a command directly after the user enters their response. The fix for this is trivial (some would even say “low-tech”). Simply put the command you want to follow at the end of the callback. In other words, the following code guarantees that we print ‘DONE!’ <strong>after</strong> the user enters their response:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-1" title="1"><span class="co">// this code is a partial snippet from previous examples</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The change above would yield a total output of:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>What&#39;s up, doc? nothing much
you responded: nothing much
DONE!</code></pre>
<p>In general, when we want to a command to occur directly “after” a callback is invoked asynchronously, we’ll really have to place that command inside of the callback. This is a simple pattern, but one that we’ll turn to often.</p>
<p>Imagine that we want to ask the user two questions in succession. That is, we want to ask question one, get their response to question one, then ask question two, and finally get their response to question two. The following code will <strong>not</strong> meet this requirement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb31-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> readline <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;readline&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>The code above is broken and will never ask the second question. Like you can probably guess, this is because the <code>question</code> method is asynchronous. Specifically, the first call to <code>question</code> will occur and before the user can enter their response, the second call to <code>question</code> also occurs. This is bad because our program is still trying to finish the first question. Since we want to ask question two only after the user responds to question one, we’ll have to use the pattern from before. That is, we should ask question two within the response callback for question one:</p>

<p>Nice! The program works as intended. The pattern we utilized is known as <em>callback chaining</em>. While callback chaining allows us to perform a series of asynchronous functions one after the other, if we don’t manage our code neatly, we can end up with a mess. Extending this pattern to three questions, we can begin to see the awkward, nested structure:</p>

<p>Run the code above to check out our final product! Ah, much better. By using named functions to handle the responses, our code structure appears flatter and easier to read.</p>
<p>Callback chaining is a very common pattern in JavaScript, so get used to it! As a rule of thumb, prefer to use named functions when creating a callback chain longer than two. Later in the course, we’ll learn about recent additions to JavaScript that help reduce “callback hell” even further, so stay tuned!</p>

<h1 id="guessing-game-project">Guessing Game Project</h1>
<p>It’s time for our first non-spec guided project! There are many projects in the course, some of which will not have test cases for you to run. These types of projects will hold your hand less and force you to make design decisions. Instead of specs, you will be provided with text instructions and example snippets to guide you. In order to end up with a working project, you should analyze these instructions closely. If you are stuck or don’t understand an instruction, ask a TA for clarification!</p>
<p>The solution for this project is available at the end of these instructions. Be sure to give it an honest shot before you take a peek!</p>
<h2 id="the-objective">The Objective</h2>
<p>Our objective for this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. We’ve denoted the user’s input with *asterisks*. All other text is produced by the computer:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I&#39;m thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
Enter a guess: *15*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *11*
Too low.
Enter a guess: *13*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *12*
Correct!
YOU WON.</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be building this project in phases, with each phase bringing us closer to the final product shown above. It’s important that you follow the phases closely and don’t jump the gun by ignoring the instructions and attempting to create your own game quickly. For these guided projects, the journey is more important than the final destination. Without further ado, let’s jump in!</p>
<h2 id="phase-i-too-high-too-low-who-knows.">Phase I: Too High? Too Low? Who knows.</h2>
<p>Begin by creating a folder called <code>guessing-game-project</code>. Open the folder in VSCode. Inside of that folder create a <code>guessing-game.js</code> file. This is the file where we will do all of the coding.</p>
<p>Begin by initializing a variable in the global scope named <code>secretNumber</code> to any positive integer. Later we will program this variable to be assigned at random, but for now we’ll hard-code a value that we can test for quickly.</p>
<h3 id="checkguess">checkGuess</h3>
<p>Define a function named <code>checkGuess</code> that accepts a number as an argument. It should compare that argument against the global <code>secretNumber</code>. It should have the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the argument is larger than <code>secretNumber</code>, it should print ‘Too high.’ and return <code>false</code></li>
<li>when the argument is smaller than <code>secretNumber</code>, it should print ‘Too low.’ and return <code>false</code></li>
<li>when the argument is equal to <code>secretNumber</code>, it should print ‘Correct!’ and return <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a moment to verify that our code is working as intended. Make a few test calls to <code>checkGuess</code> in the global scope. Be sure to use a range of numbers so we can verify that it behaves properly in all three scenarios. You’ll want to <code>console.log</code> the return values of <code>checkGuess</code> since it should return booleans. Run your code with <code>node guessing-game.js</code>. When you are positive that your function is working, remove the test calls from your file.</p>
<h3 id="askguess">askGuess</h3>
<p>Since we will be taking user input during gameplay, we’ll need to do some standard setup for Node’s <code>readline</code> module. Reference the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_readline">readline docs</a> to create an interface for input and output that we will use. To stay organized, we recommend that you import the module and create the interface at the tippy top of your file.</p>
<p>Define a function named <code>askGuess</code>. The method should use the <code>readline</code> module’s <code>question</code> method to ask the user to ‘Enter a guess:’. If you need a refresher on how to use this method, check out the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_question_query_callback">question docs</a>. Once the user enters their number, the <code>checkGuess</code> function should be called with their number as an argument and the interface should be <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_close">closed</a>.</p>
<p>When accepting user input, there is a very important nuance to take into account. When the user enters their guess it will be interpreted as a string of numeric characters and not an actual number type! Depending on how you wrote your <code>checkGuess</code> function, this could be disastrous because:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">42</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="st">&quot;42&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// false</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>To overcome this issue, we should explicitly turn their guess into a number <em>before</em> we pass it into <code>checkGuess</code>. You can do this by calling the <code>Number</code> function. Here’s an example of <code>Number</code> in action:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb38-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> str <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;42&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb38-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">42</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="at">Number</span>(str))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// true</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Test your <code>askGuess</code> by calling it once in the global scope. Then run your program a few times, entering different numbers. After trying a single guess, you will have to run the program again. Be sure to include an attempt with a correct guess by entering the <code>secretNumber</code> value that you hard-coded.</p>
<p>Once you have verified that the user’s guess is being properly checked, let’s work on having the function ask the user for another guess if they are incorrect. Refactor the <code>askGuess</code> method with some conditional logic. Recall that the <code>checkGuess</code> function returns a boolean - very convenient! Here is how the <code>askGuess</code> function should flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>check the user’s guess
<ul>
<li>if it is correct, print out ‘You win!’ and close the interface</li>
<li>if it is incorrect, call <code>askGuess</code> again</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You may find it a bit startling that you can reference the <code>askGuess</code> function from within the <code>askGuess</code> function. That is, you can a reference a function from within itself! This self-referential mechanism is leveraged quite frequently in programming. We will return to this concept in later lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run your program and test it out, being sure that you have a single call to <code>askGuess</code> in the global scope so the game can begin. Woohoo! We now have our minimal viable product (MVP) version of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Before moving onto the next phase, ask a TA for a code review.</strong></p>
<h2 id="phase-ii-making-it-random">Phase II: Making it Random</h2>
<p>Now that we have the core gameplay down, we’ll want to implement logic to allow the <code>secretNumber</code> to be chosen at random. To do this, we’ll utilize the <code>Math#random</code> method. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">docs</a>. The method returns a decimal number between 0 and 1 (excluding 1). For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb39-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">random</span>())<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 0.5719957072947224</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb39-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">random</span>())<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 0.08590173924968769</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb39-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">random</span>())<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 0.0965770175443883</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>By itself, this method won’t be too useful because our game should only use whole numbers. Luckily, the docs provide some insight into how we can design a function that returns a random whole number that lies within a certain range. Scroll through the docs and locate examples about “Getting a random integer between two values.” You’ll use these examples to inspire your code. You may notice that the examples provided rely on other methods like <code>Math.floor</code>. Research those methods so that you understand how the code works. Googling around and researching the docs is an important aspect of being a developer, so take your time!</p>
<h3 id="randominrange">randomInRange</h3>
<p>Define a function called <code>randomInRange</code> that accepts a minimum and maximum number as arguments. The function should return a random whole number between the provided minimum and maximum (inclusive). Be sure to test your function, here is an example of how it might behave:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb40-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">randomInRange</span>(<span class="dv">15</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">20</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 16</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb40-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">randomInRange</span>(<span class="dv">15</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">20</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 17</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb40-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">randomInRange</span>(<span class="dv">15</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">20</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 20</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have confirmed that your <code>randomInRange</code> function is returning numbers properly, edit your initialization of <code>secretNumber</code>. Instead of setting it to a hard-coded value, use your function’s return value to set it to a random number between 0 and 100. Play a few games! Remember that you’ll have to call <code>askGuess()</code> once in the global scope to begin the game. Next up, we’ll allow the user to choose the min and max for the game.</p>
<h3 id="askrange">askRange</h3>
<p>Delete or comment out your global call to <code>askGuess</code> for now. Define a function called <code>askRange</code>. This method should ask the user to enter a minimum number and then ask them to enter a maximum number. We want to ask them for the maximum only after they have responded to the first question. This means you will have to use the <code>question</code> method twice! Recall what you learned from the readings. The <code>question</code> method is asynchronous, so how can we ask two questions one after the other? We’ll leave the implementation to you. After the user enters their min and max, you should print a message confirming the range. Here is an example of how our <code>askRange</code> method behaves. We’ve put <em>asterisks</em> around the user’s input:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I&#39;m thinking of a number between 11 and 20...</code></pre>
<p>As always, test your function thoroughly by adding a call to <code>askRange</code> in global scope. Your program may hang because the interface is not closed after the user enters their max. That’s okay, since we are debugging; press <code>ctrl + c</code> in your terminal to kill the program.</p>
<p>Once your function is able to properly take the min and max from your user, it’s time to put it all together! When the user enters both the min and the max, call your <code>randomInRange</code> function with that min and max as arguments. Recall that the user’s input is automatically interpreted as strings and not numbers. You should explicitly turn the min and max to actual numbers before passing them in. Take the random number returned from your function and set that as the <code>secretNumber</code>. Then call your old <code>askGuess</code> method so that gameplay can begin. All of this should happen within the <code>askRange</code> function. We design it this way because we only want to ask for a guess after the random number has been chosen.</p>
<p>The <code>askRange</code> function is the “main” function that will begin our game, so you’ll need call it once in the global scope. Run your program and play a few games!</p>
<p><strong>Before moving onto the bonus ask a TA for a code review.</strong></p>
<h2 id="bonus-limiting-the-number-of-turns">Bonus: Limiting the number of turns</h2>
<p>With our main features complete, let’s work on increasing the difficulty of the game by limiting the number of guesses a user can make. If the player uses all of their attempts without guessing the correct number, they will lose the game.</p>
<h3 id="limiting-turns-to-5">Limiting turns to 5</h3>
<p>Start by limiting the player to 5 attempts. You can accomplish this by initializing a <code>numAttempts</code> variable in the global scope. Refactor your <code>askGuess</code> method to decrement the number of remaining attempts whenever it is called. If the <code>numAttempts</code> reaches 0 before the correct guess is made, end the game by printing ‘You Lose’. We’ll leave the details of the implementation up to you.</p>
<h3 id="limiting-turns-dynamically">Limiting turns dynamically</h3>
<p>Make the limit dynamic by allowing the user to specify the number of attempts. We recommend creating an <code>askLimit</code> function that behaves similarly to <code>askRange</code>. Be sure to chain the callbacks in the right order to ensure the game is configured properly. For example, one valid callback chain order would be <code>askLimit</code> -&gt; <code>askRange</code> -&gt; <code>askGuess</code>. If you follow this order, you’ll need to call <code>askLimit</code> in the global scope to begin the game.</p>

</ol>
<p>Lately, we’ve been alluding to JavaScript running in the web browser. While we are not quite ready to make that transition yet, the authors of JavaScript really only intended their creation to be used in a browser environment when they originally conceived of the language at Netscape in 1995. To prepare for the coming transition to the browser, let’s explore some of the differences between Node.js and browser environments.</p>
<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify Node.js as an environment that is <em>distinct</em> from web browsers</li>
<li>list several differences between the Node.JS and browser runtimes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="same-specification-different-implementation">Same specification, different implementation</h2>
<p>Since JavaScript is a single programming language, you may be wondering why there are <em>any</em> differences between Node.js and browsers in the first place. If they are in fact different, why wouldn’t we classify them as different programming languages? The answer is complicated, but the key idea is this: even if we just consider browser environments, different browsers themselves can differ wildly because JavaScript is a <em>specification</em>. During the rise of the World Wide Web in the 90s, companies competed for dominance (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">The First Browser War</a>). As Netscape’s “original” JavaScript language rose to prominence along with their browser, other browser companies needed to also support JavaScript to keep their users happy. Imagine if you could only visit pages as they were intended if you used a certain browser. What a horrible experience it would be (we’re looking at you Internet Explorer)! As companies “copied” Netscape’s original implementation of JavaScript, they sometimes took creative liberty in adding their own features.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a certain level of compatibility across browsers, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) defined specifications to standardize the JavaScript language. This specification is known as <em>ECMAScript</em> or <em>ES</em> for short. This allows competing browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari to have a healthy level of competition that doesn’t compromise the customer experience. So now you know that when people use the term “JavaScript” they are really referring to the core standards set by ECMAScript, although exact implementation details may differ from browser to browser.</p>
<p>The Node.js runtime was released in 2009 when there was a growing need to execute JavaScript in a portable environment, without any browser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Node.js is built on top of the same JavaScript engine as Google Chrome (V8). Neat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="differences-between-node.js-and-browsers">Differences between Node.js and browsers</h2>
<p>There are many differences between Node.js and browser environments, but many of them are small and inconsequential in practice. For example, in our <em>Asynchronous</em> lesson, we noted how <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_args">Node’s setTimeout</a> has a slightly different return value from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout">a browser’s setTimeout</a>. Let’s go over a few notable differences between the two environments.</p>
<h3 id="global-vs-window">Global vs Window</h3>
<p>In the Node.js runtime, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object">global object</a> is the object where global variables are stored. In browsers, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window object</a> is where global variables are stored. The window also includes properties and methods that deal with drawing things on the screen like images, links, and buttons. Node doesn’t need to draw anything, and so it does not come with such properties. This means that you can’t reference <code>window</code> in Node.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most browsers allow you to reference <code>global</code> but it is really the same object as <code>window</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="document">Document</h3>
<p>Browsers have access to a <code>document</code> object that contains the HTML of a page that will be rendered to the browser window. There is no <code>document</code> in Node.</p>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Browsers have access to a <code>location</code> that contains information about the web address being visited in the browser. There is no <code>location</code> in Node, since it is not on the web.</p>
<h3 id="require-and-module.exports">Require and module.exports</h3>
<p>Node has a predefined <code>require</code> function that we can use to import installed modules like <code>readline</code>. We can also import and export across our own files using <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code>. For example, say we had two different files, <code>animals.js</code> and <code>cat.js</code>, that existed in the same directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-1" title="1"><span class="co">// cat.js</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-3" title="3"><span class="kw">const</span> someCat <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-4" title="4">  <span class="dt">name</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;Sennacy&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-5" title="5">  <span class="dt">color</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;orange&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-6" title="6">  <span class="dt">age</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">3</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-7" title="7"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-8" title="8"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-9" title="9"><span class="va">module</span>.<span class="at">exports</span> <span class="op">=</span> someCat<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-1" title="1"><span class="co">// animals.js</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-3" title="3"><span class="kw">const</span> myCat <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;./cat.js&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-5" title="5"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">myCat</span>.<span class="at">name</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot; is a great pet!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we execute <code>animals.js</code> in Node, the program would print <code>'Sennacy is a great pet!'</code>.</p>
<p>Browsers don’t have a notion of a file system so we cannot use <code>require</code> or <code>module.exports</code> in the same way.</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned-6">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>In this reading, we covered a few differences between Node and browser environments, including: + Node’s <code>global</code> and browser’s <code>window</code> + the browser specific <code>document</code> and <code>location</code> objects + the Node specific <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-ins-and-outs-of-file-io-in-node">The Ins and Outs of File I/O in Node</h1>
<p>We have previously identified some differences between Node.js and browser environments. One difference was the use of <code>require</code> to import different node modules. It is often the case that these modules provide functionality that is totally absent in the browser environment. While browsers support deliberate file download or upload to the web, they typically don’t support arbitrary file access due to security concerns. Let’s explore a node module that allows us to read, write, and otherwise manipulate files on our computer.</p>
<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to use the <code>fs</code> module to perform basic read and write operations on local files.</p>
<h2 id="the-fs-module">The fs module</h2>
<p>Node ships with an <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html">fs module</a> that contains methods that allow us to interact with our computer’s <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>S</strong>ystem through JavaScript. No additional installations are required; to access this module we can simply <code>require</code> it. We recommend that you code along with this reading. Let’s begin with a <code>change-some-files.js</code> script that imports the module:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-1" title="1"><span class="co">// change-some-files.js</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-3" title="3"><span class="kw">const</span> fs <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;fs&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Similar to what we saw in the <code>readline</code> lesson, <code>require</code> will return to us a object with many properties that will enable us to do file I/O.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> I/O is short for input/output. It’s usage is widespread and all the hip tech companies are using it, like appacademy.io.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>fs</code> module contains tons of functionality! Chances are that if there is some operation you need to perform regarding files, the <code>fs</code> module supports it. The module also offers both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of these methods. We prefer to not block the thread and so we’ll opt for the asynchronous flavors of these methods.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-file">Creating a new file</h3>
<p>To create a file, we can use the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback"><code>writeFile</code></a> method. According to the documentation, there are a few ways to use it. The most straight forward way is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb45-1" title="1"><span class="co">// change-some-file.js</span></a>

<p>The code above will create a new file called <code>foo.txt</code> in the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. It will write the string <code>'Hello world!'</code> into that newly created file. The third argument specifies the encoding of the characters. There are different ways to encode characters; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> is the most common and you’ll use this in most scenarios. The fourth argument to <code>writeFile</code> is a callback that will be invoked when the write operation is complete. The docs indicate that if there is an error during the operation (such as an invalid encoding argument), an error object will be passed into the callback. This type of error handling is quite common for asynchronous functions. Like we are used to, since <code>writeFile</code> is asynchronous, we need to utilize <em>callback chaining</em> if we want to guarantee that commands occur <em>after</em> the write is complete or fails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware! If the file name specified to <code>writeFile</code> already exists, it will completely overwrite the contents of that file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We won’t be using the <code>foo.txt</code> file in the rest of this reading.</p>
<h3 id="reading-existing-files">Reading existing files</h3>
<p>To explore how to read a file, we’ll use VSCode to manually create a <code>poetry.txt</code> file within the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. Be sure to create this if you are following along.</p>
<p>Our <code>poetry.txt</code> file will contain the following lines:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>My code fails
I do not know why
My code works
I do not know why</code></pre>
<p>We can use the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback"><code>readFile</code></a> method to read the contents of this file. The method accepts very similar arguments to <code>writeFile</code>, except that the callback may be passed an error object and string containing the file contents. In the snippet below, we have replaced our previous <code>writeFile</code> code with <code>readFile</code>:</p>

<p>Success! From here, you can do anything you please with the data read from the file. For example, since <code>data</code> is a string, we could split the string on the newline character <code>\n</code> to obtain an array of the file’s lines:</p>

<h2 id="fancy-file-io">Fancy File I/O</h2>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of both <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code>, let’s use both to accomplish a task. Using the same <code>poetry.txt</code> file from before:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>My code fails

My code works

<p>Our goal is to design a program to replace occurrences of the phrase ‘do not’ with the word ‘should’. This is straightforward enough. We can read the contents of the file as a string, manipulate this string, then write this new string back into the file. We’ll need to utilize callback chaining in order for this to work since our file I/O is asynchronous:</p>

<h1 id="gitting-started-with-git">“Gitting” Started With Git!</h1>
<p>Good software is never limited to “right now”! Your code grows and changes over time, and the people who work with it may come and go. How can you be certain you’re preserving your code’s legacy? <em>Version control</em> lets us keep track of your changes over time. You’ll discuss version control with <em>Git</em>, the tool of choice for modern development teams.</p>
<p>After reading, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the role of version control in the programmer’s toolkit</li>
<li>Create and manage a Git repository</li>
<li>Share and collaborate on Git repositories via Github</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
<p>Think back to the dark ages of web development: a world of beeping modems and marquee text. If you were going to build a web application in 1995, how might you have done it? You’d start with an empty directory and add some JavaScript and HTML files. As you made changes, you’d save them directly to your directory. There’s no history of the changes you’ve made, so you’d have to keep excellent notes or have an incredible memory to revert your application to a previous state.</p>
<p>What if you have teammates working with you on this project, or a client who wants to review your work? Now each teammate needs a copy of the project directory, and you need a way to share your work with clients. This results in numerous copies of the same files and a lot of extra work keeping those files in sync. If one file gets out of line, it could spell disaster for the whole project. Yikes!</p>
<p>Instead of suffering from these problems, programmers designed a solution: <em>Version Control Systems (VCS)</em>. VCS tools abstract the work of keeping projects and programmers in sync with one another. They provide a shared language with which you can discuss changes to source code. They also allow you to step back in time and review your work. VCS tools save you hours of work each day, so learning to use them is a great investment in your productivity.</p>
<h3 id="git">Git?</h3>
<p>You’ll be using Git (pronounced similarly to ‘get’ in English) as your VCS. Git is the most popular VCS today and provides a good balance of power and ease of use. It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (who you may also recognize as the creator of Linux) to address a number of shortcomings VCS tools of that time had, including speed of code management and the ability to maintain workflow when cut off from a remote server. Git is well-known for being reliable and fast, and it brings with it an important online community you can leverage for sharing your code with a wider audience.</p>
<h2 id="git-basics">Git basics</h2>
<p>Like many disciplines, learning Git is just a matter of learning a new language. You’ll cover a lot of new vocabulary in this lesson! Remember that the vocabulary you’ll learn will allow you to communicate clearly with other developers worldwide, so it’s important to understand the meaning of each term.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that Git is a complex and powerful tool. As such, its documentation and advanced examples may be tough to understand. As your knowledge grows, you may choose to dive deeper into Git. Today, you’ll focus on the commands you’ll use every day - possibly for the rest of your programming career! Get comfortable with these commands and resist the urge to copy/paste or create keyboard shortcuts as you’re getting started.</p>
<h3 id="see-the-world-through-gits-eyes">See the world through Git’s eyes</h3>
<p>Before you look at any practical examples, let’s talk about how Git works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Here is your first new word in Git-speak: <em>repository</em>, often shortened to <em>repo</em>. A Git repo comprises all the source code for a particular project. In the “dark ages” example above, the repo is the first directory you created, where work is saved to, and which acts as the source for code shared to others. Without a repo, Git has nothing to act on.</p>
<p>Git manages your project as a series of <em>commits</em>. A commit is a collection of changes grouped towards a shared purpose. By tracking these commits, you can see your project on a timeline instead of only as a finished project:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-timeline.svg" alt="image-git-timeline" /><figcaption>image-git-timeline</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice the notes and seemingly random numbers by each commit? These are referred to as <em>commit messages</em> and <em>commit hashes</em>, respectively. Git identifies your commits by their hash, a specially-generated series of letters and numbers. You add commit messages to convey meaning and to help humans track your commits, as those hashes aren’t very friendly to read!</p>
<p>A Git hash is 40 characters long, but you only need the first few characters to identify which hash you’re referring to. By default, Git abbreviates hashes to 7 characters. You’ll follow this convention, too.</p>
<p>Git provides a helpful way for us to “alias” a commit in plain English as well. These aliases are called <em>refs</em>, short for “references”. A special one that Git creates for all repositories is <code>HEAD</code>, which references the most recent commit. You’ll learn more about creating your own refs when you learn about “branching”.</p>
<p>Git maintains three separate lists of changes: the <em>working directory</em>, the <em>staging area</em>, and the <em>commit history</em>. The working directory includes all of your in-progress changes, the staging area is reserved for changes you’re ready to commit, and the commit history is made up of changes you’ve already committed. You’ll look more at these three lists soon.</p>
<p>Git only cares about changes that are “tracked”. To track a file, you must add it to the commit history. The working directory will always show the changes, even if they aren’t tracked. In the commit history, you’ll only have a history of files that have been formally tracked by your repository.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-changes-in-a-repository">Tracking changes in a repository</h3>
<p>Now, let’s get practical!</p>
<p>You can create a repository with <code>git init</code>. Running this command will initialize a new Git repo in your current directory. It’s important to remember that you only want a repository for your project and not your whole hard drive, so always run this command inside a project folder and not your home folder or desktop. You can create a new repo in an empty folder or within a project directory you’ve already created.</p>
<p>What good is an empty repo? Not much! To add content to your repository, use <code>git add</code>. You can pass this command a specific filename, a directory, a “wildcard” to select a series of similarly-named files, or a <code>.</code> to add every untracked file in the current directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-1" title="1"><span class="co"># This will add only my_app.js to the repo:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add my_app.js</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-4" title="4"><span class="co"># This will add all the files within ./objects:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add objects/</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-7" title="7"><span class="co"># This will add all the files in the current directory ending in `.js`:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-8" title="8"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add *.js</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-9" title="9"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-10" title="10"><span class="co"># This will add everything in your current directory:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-11" title="11"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add .</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Adding a file (or files) moves them from Git’s working directory to the staging area. You can see what’s been “staged” and what hasn’t by using <code>git status</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-status-output.svg" alt="image-git-status-output" /><figcaption>image-git-status-output</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this example, “Changes to be committed” is your staging area and “Changes not staged for commit” is your working directory. Notice that you also have “Untracked files”, Git’s way of reminding us that you may have forgotten to <code>git add</code> a file to your repo. Most Git commands will include a bit of help text in the output, so always read the messages carefully before moving forward. Thanks, Git!</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your files and have staged them, you’ll use <code>git commit</code> to push them into the commit history. It’s significantly more work to make changes after a commit, so be sure your files are staged and exactly as you’d like them before running this command. Your default text editor will pop up, and you’ll be asked to enter a commit message for this group of changes.</p>
<p><strong>Heads Up:</strong> You may find yourself in an unfamiliar place! The default text editor for MacOS (and many variants of Linux) is called <em>Vim</em>. Vim is a terminal-based text editor you’ll discuss in the near future. It’s visually bare and may just look like terminal text to you! If this happens, don’t worry - just type <code>:q</code> and press your “return” key to exit.</p>
<p>You’ll want to ensure that future commit messages open in a more familiar editor. You can run the following commands in your terminal to ensure that Visual Studio Code is your <code>git commit</code> editor from now on:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> config --global core.editor <span class="st">&quot;code --wait&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> config --global -e</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you experience any issues, you may be missing Visual Studio Code’s command line tools. You can find more details and some troubleshooting tips on Microsoft’s official <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">VS Code and macOS documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Once you close your editor, the commit will be added to your repository’s commit history. Use <code>git log</code> to see this history at any time. This command will show all the commits in your repository’s history, beginning with the most recent:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-log-output.svg" alt="image-git-log-output" /><figcaption>image-git-log-output</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like many Git commands, <code>git commit</code> includes some helpful shorthand. If you need a rather short commit message, you can use the <code>-m</code> flag to include the message inline. Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Fix typo&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will commit your changes with the message “Fix typo” and avoid opening your default text editor. Remember the commit messages are how you make your project’s history friendly to humans, so don’t use the <code>-m</code> flag as an excuse to write lame commit messages! A commit message should always explain why changes were made in clear, concise language. It is also best practice to use imperative voice in commit messages (i.e. use “Fix typo” instead of “Fixing the typo” or “Typo was fixed”).</p>
<h3 id="branches-and-workflow">Branches and workflow</h3>
<p>You’ve seen what a project looks like with a linear commit history, but that’s just scratching the surface of Git’s utility. Let’s explore a new realm with <em>branches</em>. A branch is a separate timeline in Git, reserved for its own changes. You’ll use branches to make your own changes independently of others. These branches can then be <em>merged</em> back into the main branch at a later time.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a common scenario: a school project. It’s a lot of extra hassle to schedule time together and argue over exactly what should be done next! Instead, group members will often assign tasks amongst themselves, work independently on their tasks, and reunite to bring it all together as a final report. Git branches let us emulate this workflow for code: you can make a copy of what’s been done so far, complete a task on your new branch, and merge that branch back into the shared repository for others to use.</p>
<p>By default, Git repos begin on the <code>master</code> branch. To create a new branch, use <code>git branch &lt;name-of-your-branch&gt;</code>. This will create a named reference to your current commit and let you add commits without affecting the <code>master</code> branch. Here’s what a branch looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-branch.svg" alt="image-git-branch" /><figcaption>image-git-branch</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice how your refs help to identify branches here: <code>master</code> stays to itself and can have changes added to it independently of your new branch (<code>footer</code>). <code>HEAD</code>, Git’s special ref, follows us around, so you know that in the above diagram you’re working on the <code>footer</code> branch.</p>
<p>You can create a new branch or visit an existing branch in your repository. This is especially helpful for returning the <code>master</code> branch or for projects you’ve received from teammates. To open an existing branch, use <code>git checkout &lt;name-of-branch&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="bringing-it-back-together">Bringing it back together</h3>
<p>Once you’re happy with the code in the branch you’ve been working on, you’ll likely want to integrate the code into the <code>master</code> branch. You can do this via <code>git merge</code>. Merging will bring the changes in from another branch and integrate them into yours. Here’s an example workflow:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> branch my-changes</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add new-file.js</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Add new file&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout master</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> merge my-changes</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Following these steps will integrate the commit from <code>my-changes</code> over to <code>master</code>. Boom! Now you have your <code>new-file.js</code> on your default branch.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, branching can get <em>very</em> complicated. Your repository’s history may look more like a shrub than a beautiful tree! You’ll discuss advanced merging and other options in an upcoming lesson.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-with-the-world-via-github">Connecting with the world via GitHub</h2>
<p>Git can act as a great history tool and source code backup for your local projects, but it can also help you work with a team! Git is classified as a “DVCS”, or “Distributed Version Control System”. This means it has built-in support for managing code both locally and from a distant source.</p>
<p>You can refer to a repository source that’s not local as a <em>remote</em>. Your Git repository can have any number of remotes, but you’ll usually only have one. By default you’ll refer to the primary remote of a repo as the <code>origin</code>.</p>
<p>You can add a remote to an existing repository on your computer, or you can retrieve a repository from a remote source. You can refer to this as <em>cloning</em> the repo. Once you have a repository with a remote, you can update your local code from the remote by <em>pulling</em> code down, and you can <em>push</em> up your own code so others have access to it.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-via-git-and-github">Collaboration via Git and GitHub</h3>
<p>While a remote Git server can be run anywhere, there are a few places online that have become industry standards for hosting remote Git repositories. The best-known and most widely-used Git source is a website called <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. As the name suggests, GitHub is a global hub for Git repositories. It’s free to make a Github account, and you’ll find literally millions of public repositories you can browse.</p>
<p>GitHub takes a lot of work out of managing remote Git repositories. Instead of having to manage your own server, GitHub provides managed hosting and even includes some helpful graphical tools for complicated tasks like deployment, branch merging, and code review.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a typical workflow using Git and GitHub. Imagine it’s your first day on the job. How do you get access to your team’s codebase? By cloning the repository!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> clone https://github.com/your-team/your-codebase.git</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>git clone</code> command will create a new folder in your current directory named after the repo you’re cloning (in this case, <code>your-codebase</code>). Inside that folder will be a git repository of your very own, containing the repo’s entire commit history. Now you’re ready to get started.</p>
<p>You’ll likely start on the <code>master</code> branch, but remember that this is the default branch and it’s unlikely you want to make changes to it. Since you’re working on a team now, it’s important to think of how your changes to the repository might affect others. The safest way to make changes is to create a new branch, make your changes there, and then push your branch up to the remote repository for review. You’ll use the <code>git push</code> command to do this. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> branch add-my-new-file</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add my-new-file.js</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Add new file&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> push -u origin add-my-new-file</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how you used the <code>-u</code> flag with <code>git push</code>. This flag, shorthand for <code>--set-upstream</code>, lets Git know that you want your local branch to follow a remote branch. You’ve passed the same name in, so you’ll now have two branches in your local repository: <code>add-my-new-file</code>, which is where your changes live after being committed, and <code>origin/add-my-new-file</code>, which keeps up with your remote branch and updates it after you use <code>git push</code>. You only need to use the <code>-u</code> flag the first time you push each new branch - Git will know what to do with a simple <code>git push</code> from then on.</p>
<p>You now know how to push your changes up, but what about getting the changes your teammates have made? For this, you’ll use <code>git pull</code>. Pulling from the remote repo will update all of your local branches with the code from each branch’s remote counterpart. Behind the scenes, Git is running two separate commands: <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>. Fetching retrieves the repository code and updates any remote tracking branches in your local repo, and merge does just you’ve already explored: integrates changes into the local branches. Here’s a graphic to explain this a little better:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-pull-parts.svg" alt="image-git-pull-parts" /><figcaption>image-git-pull-parts</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s important to remember to use <code>git pull</code> often. A dynamic team may commit and push code many times during the day, and it’s easy to fall behind. The more often you <code>pull</code>, the more certain you can be that your own code is based on the “latest and greatest”.</p>
<h3 id="merging-your-code-on-github">Merging your code on GitHub</h3>
<p>If you’re paying close attention, you may have noticed that there’s a missing step in your workflows so far: how do you get your code merged into your default branch? This is done by a process called a <em>Pull Request</em>.</p>
<p>A pull request (or “PR”) is a feature specific to GitHub, not a feature of Git. It’s a safety net to prevent bugs, and it’s a critical part of the collaboration workflow. Here’s a high-level of overview of how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>You push your code up to GitHub in its own branch.</li>
<li>You open a pull request against a <em>base branch</em>.</li>
<li>GitHub creates a comparison page just for your code, detailing the changes you’ve made.</li>
<li>Other members of the team can review your code for errors.</li>
<li>You make changes to your branch based on feedback and push the new commits up.</li>
<li>The PR automatically updates with your changes.</li>
<li>Once everyone is satisfied, a repo maintainer on GitHub can merge your branch.</li>
<li>Huzzah! Your code is in the main branch and ready for everyone else to <code>git pull</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll create and manage your pull requests via GitHub’s web portal, instead of the command line. You’ll walk through the process of creating, reviewing, and merging a pull request in an upcoming project.</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned-8">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>This lesson included lots of new lingo and two new tools you can take advantage of immediately: Git and GitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should feel comfortable exploring both of these more on your own.</li>
<li>You should understand that a VCS is a critical part of your development workflow.</li>
<li>You able to get started tracking your own projects and sharing code across a team.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s still a little hazy, never fear! Git will be a core part of your projects going forward. You’ll get lots of practice <code>pull</code>ing, <code>push</code>ing, and <code>clone</code>-ing in the coming months.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="browsing-your-git-repository">Browsing Your Git Repository</h1>
<p>Repositories can feel intimidating at first, but it won’t take you long to navigate code like you own the place - because you do! Let’s discuss a few tools native to Git that help us browse our changes over time.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing changes with <code>git diff</code></li>
<li>Browsing through our code “checkpoints” with <code>git checkout</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seeing-changes-in-real-time">Seeing changes in real time</h2>
<p>Git is all about change tracking, so it makes sense that it would include a utility for visualizing a set of changes. We refer to a list of differences between two files (or the same file over time) as a <em>diff</em>, and we can use <code>git diff</code> to visualize diffs in our repo!</p>
<p>When run with no extra options, <code>git diff</code> will return any tracked changes in our working directory since the last commit. <strong>Tracked</strong> is a key word here; <code>git diff</code> won’t show us changes to files that haven’t been included in our repo via <code>git add</code>. This is helpful for seeing what you’ve changed before committing! Here’s an example of a small change:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-diff-output.svg" alt="git-diff" /><figcaption>git-diff</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s break down some of the new syntax in this output.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The diff opens with some Git-specific data, including the branch/files we’re checking, and some unique hashes that Git uses to track each diff. You can skip past this to get to the important bits.</p></li>
<li><p><code>---</code> &amp; <code>+++</code> let us know that there are both additions and subtractions in the file “App.js”. A diff doesn’t have a concept of inline changes - it treats a single change as removing something old and replacing it with something new.</p></li>
<li><p><code>@@</code> lets us know that we’re starting a single “chunk” of the diff. A diff could have multiple chunks for a single file (for example: if you made changes far apart, like the header &amp; footer). The numbers in between tell us how many lines we’re seeing and where they start. For example: <code>@@ +1,3 -1,3 @@</code> means we’ll see three lines of significant content, including both addition &amp; removal, beginning at line one.</p></li>
<li><p>In the code itself, lines that were removed are prefixed with a <code>-</code> and lines that were added are prefixed with a <code>+</code>. Remember that you won’t see these on the same lines. Even if you only changed a few words, Git will still treat it like the whole line was replaced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diff-options">Diff options</h3>
<p>Remember that, by default, <code>git diff</code> compares the current working directory to the last commit. You can compare the staging area instead of the working directory with <code>git diff --staged</code>. This is another great way to double-check your work before pushing up to a remote branch.</p>
<p>You’re also not limited to your current branch - or even your current commit! You can pass a base &amp; target branch to compare, and you can use some special characters to help you browse faster! Here are a few examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb61"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-1" title="1"><span class="co"># See differences between the &#39;feature&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-2" title="2"><span class="co"># branch and the &#39;master&#39; branch.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> diff master feature</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-5" title="5"><span class="co"># Compare two different commits</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-6" title="6"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> diff 1fc345a 2e3dff</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-8" title="8"><span class="co"># Compare a specific file across separate commits</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-9" title="9"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> diff 1fc345a 2e3dff my-file.js</a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="time-travel">Time travel</h2>
<p><code>git diff</code> gives us the opportunity to explore our code’s current state, but what if we wanted to see its state at a different point in time? We can use <em>checkout</em>! <code>git checkout</code> lets us take control of our <code>HEAD</code> to bounce around our timeline as we please.</p>
<p>Remember that <code>HEAD</code> is a special Git reference that usually follows the latest commit on our current branch. We can use <code>git checkout</code> to point our <code>HEAD</code> reference at a different commit, letting us travel to any commit in our repository’s history. By reading the commit message and exploring the code at the time of the commit, we can see not only what changed but also why it changed! This can be great for debugging a problem or understanding how an app evolved.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a diagram to understand what <code>checkout</code> does a little better:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-checkout.svg" alt="checkout" /><figcaption>checkout</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that we haven’t lost any commits, commit messages, or code changes. Using <code>git checkout</code> is entirely non-destructive.</p>
<p>To browse to a different commit, simply pass in a reference or hash for the commit you’d like to explore. <code>git checkout</code> also supports a few special characters &amp; reserved references:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb62"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-1" title="1"><span class="co"># You can checkout a branch name.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-2" title="2"><span class="co"># You&#39;ll be using this particular branch a lot!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout master</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-5" title="5"><span class="co"># You can also use commit hashes directly</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-6" title="6"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout 7d3e2f1</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-8" title="8"><span class="co"># Using a hyphen instead of a hash will take</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-9" title="9"><span class="co"># you to the last branch you checked out</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-10" title="10"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout -</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-11" title="11"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-12" title="12"><span class="co"># You can use &quot;HEAD~N&quot; to move N commits prior</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-13" title="13"><span class="co"># to the current HEAD</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-14" title="14"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout HEAD~3</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you’re done browsing the repo’s history, you can use <code>git checkout &lt;your-branch-name&gt;</code> to move <code>HEAD</code> back to the front of the line (your most recent commit). For example, in our diagram above, we could use <code>git checkout master</code> to take our <code>HEAD</code> reference back to commit <code>42ffa1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="why-checkout">Why checkout?</h3>
<p>Most of Git’s power comes from a simple ability: viewing commits in the past and understanding how they connect. This is why mastering the <code>git checkout</code> command is so important: it lets you think more like Git and gives you full freedom of navigation without risking damage to the repo’s contents.</p>
<p>That said, you’ll likely use shortcuts like <code>git checkout -</code> far more often than specifically checking out commit hashes. Especially with the advent of user-friendly tools like GitHub, it’s much easier to visualize changes outside the command line. We’ll demonstrate browsing commit histories on GitHub in a future lesson.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>We’re building our skill set for navigating code efficiently, and we’re starting to got more accustomed to seeing our projects as a series of checkpoints we can review instead of a single point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to compare code changes between commits or files.</li>
<li>You should have confidence when switching between branches or commits.</li>
<li>You should understand the role of <code>git checkout</code> as fundamental to how Git organizes our projects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="git-do-overs-reset-rebase">Git Do-Overs: Reset &amp; Rebase</h1>
<p>Git is designed to protect you - not only from others, but also from yourself! Of course, there are times where you’d like to exercise your own judgement, even if it may not be the best thing to do. For this, Git provides some helpful tools to change commits and “time travel”.</p>
<p>Before we talk about these, a warning: <strong>The commands in this lesson are destructive!</strong> If used improperly, you could lose work, damage a teammate’s branch, or even rewrite the history of your entire project. You should exercise caution when using these on production code, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you’re unsure what a command might do.</p>
<p>After this lesson, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to roll back changes to particular commit.</li>
<li>Have an understanding of how rebasing affects your commit history.</li>
<li>Know when to rebase/reset and when <strong>not</strong> to.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resetting-the-past">Resetting the past</h2>
<p>Remember how our commits form a timeline? We can see the state of our project at any point using <code>git checkout</code>. What if we want to travel back in time to a point before we caused a new bug or chose a terrible font? <code>git reset</code> is the answer!</p>
<p><em>Resetting</em> involves moving our <code>HEAD</code> ref back to a different commit. No matter how we reset, <code>HEAD</code> will move with us. Unlike <code>git checkout</code>, this will also destroy intermediate commits. We can use some additional flags to determine how our code changes are handled.</p>
<h2 id="starting-small-soft-resets">Starting small: Soft resets</h2>
<p>The least-dangerous reset of all is <code>git reset --soft</code>. A soft reset will move our <code>HEAD</code> ref to the commit we’ve specified, and will leave any intermediate changes in the staging area. This means you won’t lose any code, though you will lose commit messages.</p>
<p>A practical example of when a soft reset would be handy is joining some small commits into a larger one. We’ll pretend we’ve been struggling with “their”, “there”, and “they’re” in our app. Here’s our commit history:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-soft-history-before.svg" alt="reset-soft-history-before" /><figcaption>reset-soft-history-before</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those commit messages aren’t great: they’re not very explanatory, and they don’t provide a lot of value in our commit history. We’ll fix them with a soft reset:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-1" title="1"><span class="fu">git</span> reset --soft 9c5e2fc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This moves our <code>HEAD</code> ref back to our first commit. Looking at our commit log now, we might be worried we’ve lost our changes:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-soft-history-during.svg" alt="image-git-reset-soft-history-during" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-soft-history-during</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, check out <code>git status</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-status-after-soft.svg" alt="image-git-reset-status-after-soft" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-status-after-soft</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll see that our changes are still present in the staging area, ready to be re-committed when we’re ready! We can use <code>git commit</code> to re-apply those changes to our commit history with a new, more helpful message instead:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-soft-history-after.svg" alt="image-git-reset-soft-history-after" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-soft-history-after</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that the new commit has a totally new hash. The old commit messages (and their associated hashes) have been lost, but our code changes are safe and sound!</p>
<h2 id="getting-riskier-mixed-resets">Getting riskier: Mixed resets</h2>
<p>If soft resets are the safest form of <code>git reset</code>, mixed resets are the most average! This is exactly why they’re the default: running <code>git reset</code> without adding a flag is the same as running <code>git reset --mixed</code>.</p>
<p>In a mixed reset, your changes are preserved, but they’re moved from the commit history directly to the working directory. This means you’ll have to use <code>git add</code> to choose everything you want in future commits.</p>
<p>Mixed resets are a good option when you want to alter a change in a previous commit. Let’s use a mixed reset with our “their”, “there”, “they’re” example again.</p>
<p>We’ll start with “they’re”:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-mixed-history-before.svg" alt="image-git-reset-mixed-history-before" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-mixed-history-before</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of pushing ahead, we’d like to revoke that change and try it again. Let’s use a mixed reset:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-1" title="1"><span class="fu">git</span> reset 9c5e2fc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you’ll see that your changes are in the working directory instead of the staging area:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-status-after-mixed.svg" alt="image-git-reset-status-after-mixed" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-status-after-mixed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can edit your files, make the changes you’d like, and use <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> to add a new commit to your repo:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-mixed-history-after.svg" alt="image-git-reset-mixed-history-after" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-mixed-history-after</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice again that you don’t lose your code with a mixed reset, but you do lose your commit messages &amp; hashes. The difference between <code>--soft</code> and <code>--mixed</code> comes down to whether you’ll be keeping the code exactly the same before re-committing it or making changes.</p>
<h2 id="red-alert-hard-resets">Red alert! Hard resets</h2>
<p>Hard resets are the most dangerous type of reset in Git. Hard resets adjust your <code>HEAD</code> ref and <em>totally destroy any interim code changes</em>. Poof. Gone forever.</p>
<p>There are very few good uses for a hard reset, but one is to get yourself out of a tight spot. Let’s say you’ve made a few changes to your repository but you now realize those changes were unnecessary. You’d like to move back in time so that your code looks exactly as it did before any changes were made. <code>git reset --hard</code> can take you there.</p>
<p>It’s our last round with “their”, “there”, and “they’re”. We’ve tried it all three ways and decided we don’t need to use that word at all! Let’s walk through a hard reset to get rid of our changes.</p>
<p>We’ll start in the same place we began for our soft reset:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It turns out that we’ll be using a video on our homepage and don’t need text at all! Let’s step back in time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-1" title="1"><span class="fu">git</span> reset --hard 9c5e2fc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Our Git log output is much simpler now:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Take a look at <code>git status</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-reset-status-before-after.svg" alt="image-git-reset-status-before-after" /><figcaption>image-git-reset-status-before-after</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s empty - no changes in your working directory and no changes in your staging area. This is major difference between a hard reset and a soft/mixed reset: you will lose <em>all your changes</em> back to the commit you’ve reset to.</p>
<p>If your teammate came rushing in to tell you that the boss has changed their mind and wants that homepage text after all, you’re going to be re-doing all that work! Be very confident that the changes you’re losing are unimportant before embarking on a hard reset.</p>
<h2 id="rebase-an-alternative-form-of-time-travel">Rebase: An alternative form of time travel</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to change more than a few commits on a linear timeline. What if we want to move multiple commits across branches? <code>git rebase</code> is the tool for us!</p>
<p><em>Rebasing</em> involves changing your current branch’s base branch. We might do this if we accidentally started our branch from the wrong commit or if we’d like to incorporate changes from another branch into our own.</p>
<p>You’re probably thinking “Gee, this sounds familiar! Can’t we accomplish those tasks with <code>git merge</code>?” In almost all cases, you’d be right. Rebasing is a dangerous process that effectively rewrites history. There’s a whole slew of movies, books, and TV shows that explain why rewriting history is a bad idea!</p>
<h2 id="okay-rebasing-is-risky-show-me-anyway.">Okay, rebasing is risky! Show me anyway.</h2>
<p>Let’s look at a situation where we might be tempted to rebase. We’ve added a couple commits to a feature branch while other team members have been merging their code into the <code>master</code> branch. Once we’re ready to merge our own branch, we probably want to follow a tried-and-true procedure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> pull origin master</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will fetch our remote <code>master</code> branch and merge its changes into our own feature branch, so it’s safe to pull request or <code>git push</code>. However, every time we do that, a merge commit will be created! This can make a big mess of our Git commit history, especially if lots of people are making small changes.</p>
<p>We can use <code>git rebase</code> to move our changes silently onto the latest version of <code>master</code>. Here’s what the <code>git log</code> history of our two example branches looks like:</p>
<h3 id="master"><code>master</code></h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-rebase-master-before.svg" alt="image-git-rebase-master-before" /><figcaption>image-git-rebase-master-before</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="working-on-the-header-our-feature-branch"><code>working-on-the-header</code> (our feature branch)</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-rebase-feature-before.svg" alt="image-git-rebase-feature-before" /><figcaption>image-git-rebase-feature-before</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that both branches start at <code>9c5e2fc</code>. That’s our common ancestor commit, and is where <code>git merge</code> would start stitching these branches together! We’re going to avoid that entirely with a rebase. We’ll run this command while we have <code>working-on-the-header</code> checked out:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-1" title="1"><span class="fu">git</span> rebase master</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s our new commit history:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-rebase-after.svg" alt="image-git-rebase-after" /><figcaption>image-git-rebase-after</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And a diagram of what just happened:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-rebase-before-and-after.svg" alt="image-git-rebase-before-and-after" /><figcaption>image-git-rebase-before-and-after</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>See how we changed the color of our commits after the rebase? Take a close look at the commit history changes as well. Even though our commits have the same content, they have a new hash assigned, meaning they’re entirely new commits! This is what we mean by “rewriting history”: we’ve actually changed how Git refers to these changes now.</p>
<h2 id="one-last-warning-the-golden-rule-of-git">One last warning &amp; the “Golden Rule of Git”</h2>
<p>These tools can all feel pretty nifty, but be very wary of using them too much! While they can augment your Git skills from good to great, they can also have catastrophic side effects.</p>
<p>There’s a “Golden Rule of Git” you should know that directly relates to both <code>git reset</code> and <code>git rebase</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never change the history of a branch that’s shared with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it! It’s simple and to the point. If you’re resetting or rebasing your own code and you make a mistake, your worst case scenario is losing your own changes. However, if you start changing the history of code that others have contributed or are relying on, your accidental loss could affect many others!</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-1">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>What a wild trip we’ve been on! Watching commits come and go as we <code>git reset</code> and <code>get rebase</code> can get a little confusing. Remember that while these tools are unlikely to be part of your everyday workflow, they’re great topics for technical interviews. You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how <code>git reset</code> differs from <code>git checkout</code>.</li>
<li>Be able to list the 3 types of <code>git reset</code> and differentiate them.</li>
<li>Be comfortable comparing and contrasting <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>Remember the “Golden Rule of Git”: never rewrite history after a <code>git push</code>!</li>

<h1 id="git-merge-conflicts-you">Git Merge Conflicts &amp; You</h1>
<p>Welcome to the arena! Let’s discuss what you’ll need to do when attempting to merge two conflicting Git branches. You’ll get to make the final say in which code enters…and which code leaves!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>git merge</code> process in-depth</li>
<li>Managing conflicting code across branches</li>
<li>Common workflows to help know how &amp; when to merge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-merge-conflict">What is a “merge conflict”?</h2>
<p>Whoa there - maybe we dove in a little too fast. Let’s discuss what a merge conflict is and how we can resolve it.</p>
<p>First off, what is a <em>merge conflict</em>? It’s a special state Git presents us with when two branches have code changes that are incompatible with each other. Here’s a very simple example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re working on a team trying to design a new app. You’re working on the Git branch <code>my-red-app</code>, because you’ve decided that the app’s primary color should be red! You add the following code to line 3 of your app’s main file, <code>App.js</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-1" title="1"><span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="at">primaryColor</span> <span class="op">=</span> red<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>At the same time, one of your teammates has opened the <code>my-blue-app</code> branch with an alternative decision on your app’s aesthetics. They add the following code to line of 3 of their <code>App.js</code> file:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-1" title="1"><span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="at">primaryColor</span> <span class="op">=</span> blue<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Your friend types a little faster than you and has already merged their code into the <code>master</code> branch. You get ready to merge your own code and…<strong>Merge Conflict!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Git identifies changes to <code>master</code> since your branch began and flags similar changes in the same place on your branch. Instead of trying to make a decision on your behalf, it hands you control. A merge conflict is Git’s way of saying “I’m not sure what to do - help!”.</p>
<p>Here’s what a merge conflict looks like between branches:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-merge-conflict.svg" alt="mrg-conflict" /><figcaption>mrg-conflict</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yikes! Remember that this looks awfully complicated, but the theory is pretty simple. In the workplace you’ll need to resolve much more complicated conflicts than this so now’s the time to get your practice in.</p>
<h2 id="resolving-a-merge-conflict">Resolving a merge conflict</h2>
<p>Git is a complex tool, but it’s built to help guide us as much as it can. Merge conflicts are no different. You will find that resolving them is easy once you know what you’re looking at.</p>
<p>We’ll stick with our “Red vs. Blue” example from above. When you attempt to <code>git merge</code>, you’ll get a message like the following:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-merge-conflict-message.svg" alt="mrg-conflict-msg" /><figcaption>mrg-conflict-msg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Git is so helpful - it’s telling us where to look <em>and</em> what to do! Following the instructions here, we’ll look at <code>App.js</code>, resolve the conflict, and <code>git commit</code> with our resolved file(s).</p>
<p>For even more info, check out <code>git status</code> during a merge conflict:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-merge-conflict-status-output.svg" alt="mrg-conflict-status" /><figcaption>mrg-conflict-status</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice the <code>both modified</code> prefix, reminding us that we have a conflict. “Both” refers to our two branches, <code>my-red-app</code> and <code>master</code>, which each include changes to the conflicting file. It’s up to us to decide what code the file should contain when we complete the merge.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>If we open the conflicting file, we’ll see some new syntax: <img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/git/assets/image-git-merge-conflict-inline-operators.svg" alt="conflict-operators" /></p>
<p>Notice the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> (line 3), <code>======</code> (line 5), and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> (line 7). These are special delimiters that Git uses to separate two pieces of conflicting code.</p>
<p>The first piece of code (between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>======</code>) comes from our <em>base branch</em> - the branch we’re merging in to, which we’re currently on. We can see it’s labelled “HEAD”, and VS Code is helping us out by noting that this is the “Current Change”.</p>
<p>The second piece of code (between <code>======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) comes from our <em>incoming branch</em>. VS Code is again helping us out by labelling this as the “Incoming Change”.</p>
<p>To resolve this conflict, we need to decide which code to keep and which to get rid of. This is where your communication skills become important! During a merge conflict, you’ll need to check in with teammates to decide what’s best. Once you’ve come to a decision, you can edit the file, leaving only the code you want in the base branch when the conflict is over. If we decided to keep “red” in our example, we would delete lines 3, 4, 5, and 7.</p>
<p>You can do this manually in other editors, but VS Code helps us by providing the “Accept” buttons above our conflict. You can click “Accept Incoming Changes” to automatically update the code for us. It will remove the “Current Changes” and any delimiters related to this conflict, leaving only the “Incoming Changes” we chose to keep.</p>
<h2 id="back-on-solid-ground">Back on solid ground</h2>
<p>Once you’ve saved your resolved file, the process is more familiar. You’ll save your file, use <code>git add</code> to add it to the staging area, and <code>git commit</code> to complete the merge. Git will help you out with the commit message: it should say something like “Merge branch ‘my-red-branch’”, though you can change this during the commit process if you’d like.</p>
<p>There are a few important things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not every merge results in a conflict, and not every change between two branches requires resolution! Git is smart about bringing code together when it’s in separate files or on different lines, so it won’t need your help to resolve every single change. It’s only when two pieces of code actually conflict that Git will ask you to get involved.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git merge</code> is the safest way to ensure your code is up to date. We’ve looked at merging a “finished” branch back into <code>master</code> here, but you can also merge <code>master</code> into your feature branch while you’re working on it! While this may cause conflicts, you’re well-equipped to handle them now.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge conflicts will always result in a <em>merge commit</em>: an extra commit in your history documenting where code was merged in from other sources. We’ll discuss more dangerous ways of merging in code without these commits in an upcoming lesson.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-2">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>Whew! We’ve emerged victorious from our merge conflict and can start work on a new branch or feature. Merge conflicts are a nearly daily part of life as a developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should now be able to identify the difference between a base branch and incoming branch.</li>
<li>You should understand how <code>git merge</code> works and what it does when it’s unable to proceed automatically.</li>
<li>You’re now familiar with resolving merge conflicts, both with VS Code’s helpers and when in another editor by manually editing code.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="scrum-stands-for-nothing">“Scrum” Stands For … Nothing!</h1>
<p>The word “scrum” is not an acronym. Rather, it is a term borrowed from the sport of rugby where it refers to the method of restarting a game after an accidental infringement, or when the ball has gone out of play. The players of the two teams group together around the rugby ball, arms locked, heads down, struggling to gain possession of the ball. An article in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> used this sports-based phenomenon as a metaphor for product development in the 1986 article “The New New Product Development Game”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The … “relay race” approach to product development … may conflict with the goals of maximum speed and flexibility. Instead a holistic or “rugby” approach—where a team tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth—may better serve today’s competitive requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article inspired Jeff Sutherland to invent the “Scrum process” in 1993 for use on a software development team. at Easel Corporation. Two years later, Ken Schwaber published the first paper on Scrum at OOPSLA. From that conference, others tried the methodology as Sutherland and Schwaber wrote books, articles, and presented at conferences about their novel approach to creating software.</p>
<p>In this reading, you will learn about all of the different practices and artifacts in the standard Scrum framework.</p>
<h2 id="the-standard-scrum-process">The standard Scrum process</h2>
<p>Surprise! There is <em>no</em> standardized process! There is no series of sequential steps for you and your team to methodically follow to produce high-quality products. Instead, Scrum is a <strong>framework</strong> for organizing and managing work. It is a framework based on a set of values, practices, and principles that provide a foundation to which your team can add its unique practices and specific approaches for realizing “Scrum”. This results in a version of Scrum that uniquely fits your team.</p>
<p>This is the reason that Scrum has become the leading contender in the pantheon of certified Agile software development methodologies. Most of the other methodologies have sets of strict rules about what must be done and actions that people must take. These restrictions made those other Agile software development methodologies unpalatable to many companies.</p>
<p>Of course, the flip side is that an organization’s “unique practices and special approaches” can pollute the Scrum process, turing it into an aberration and rendering it a useless and frustrating morass of bureaucracy and bookkeeping. So, best to keep it as pure and simple as the Scrum framework describes.</p>
<h2 id="the-scrum-practices">The Scrum practices</h2>
<p>Scrum has been described as a “refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration.” These value manifest themselves in four dimensions in Scrum:</p>
<ul>
<li>the roles of the people that participate in Scrum;</li>
<li>the activities in which a team using Scrum will participate;</li>
<li>the artifacts created to manage the process; and,</li>
<li>the rules that bind the interactions of the roles, activiites, and artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scrum-roles">Scrum roles</h2>
<p>When you work on a team using Scrum, the people on that team take on a role in the Scrum process. The three roles are <strong>product owner</strong>, <strong>Scrum master</strong>, and a member of the <strong>development team</strong>. It is best when no one person fills more than one role. (Of course, many companies say, “We can customize Scrum to meet our own special way of doing things, and our special way of doing things is to be cheap and not spend money on humans to actually help out with product development!”) The product owner shoulders the responsibility for what will be developed and the order in which the features of the software will be implemented. The Scrum master gets to guide the team in creating and following its own Scrum-based process. The members of the development team determine how to deliver the features asked for by the product owner.</p>
<p>So, where is “manager” or “team lead”? Where is “Vice President” and "CEO? You should note that <strong>product owner</strong>, <strong>Scrum master</strong>, and being a member of the <strong>development team</strong> are <em>roles</em> and not titles. Anyone can fit into those roles as long as they live up to the expectations set by that role.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-owner">The product owner</h3>
<p>The product owner provides the leadership needed to define the product. That person has the singlular authority to decide which features and functionality to build and in which order to build them. The product owner must have a clear vision of what the product the Scrum team is trying to build. Because this person must define and communicate that vision, the product owner is responsible for the overall success of the software (or other product) in development or maintenance.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the focus for the software being built is something to be sold to consumers (B2C software), sold to other businesses (B2B software), or used solely within the company (internal software). The product owner has the obligation to make sure the team performs the most valuable work possible. To ensure that the team rapidly builds what the product owner wants, the product owner actively collaborates with the Scrum master and development team. The product owner must avail themselves for questions from the development team that could arise at any time.</p>
<h3 id="the-scrum-master">The Scrum master</h3>
<p>The Scrum master helps everyone understand and embrace the Scrum values and principles, the practices and procedures. The Scrum master provides process leadership. The Scrum master helps the Scrum team and the rest of the company develop their own organization-specific, high-performance adaptation of Scrum.</p>
<p>As a facilitator of Scrum, the Scrum master helps the team continuously improve it use of Scrum, allowing the team to focus on its product development priorities. Preventing the team from getting distracted by outside interference and by removing roadblocks that inhibit the team’s productivity, the Scrum master plays the pivotal role of the facilitator of team focus.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to note that the Scrum master is <em>not</em> a project manager or development manager. The Scrum master has no formal authority to control what a team does. Instead, the Scrum master acts as a <em>leader</em>, not a manager.</p>
<h3 id="the-development-team">The development team</h3>
<p>You may have heard of different types of people that fit into the software development process: QA tester, database administrator, user interface designer, user experience engineer, programmer, architect, and more. Scrum eschews any of those and provides only the single term of “development team” to encapsulate and acknowledge the diverse group of people that it takes to make any non-trivial software product.</p>
<p>The development team organizes itself around the principles of Scrum to determine the best way to practice Scrum. A development team typically ranges in size from five to ten people. Together, the members of the team have the necessary skills to produce well-designed and well-tested software. Some very large companies practice Scrum; instead of having their hundreds of software developers all on a single huge Scrum team, they will normally create groups of five to ten people to make up small Scrum teams all working on parts of a larger product.</p>
<h2 id="scrum-activities.-scrum-artifacts.">Scrum activities. Scrum artifacts.</h2>
<p>The activities that make up the performances of the different roles of a Scrum team are simple to list. They are a cycle that gets performed over and over again.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The product owner has a vision of what needs to be created.</li>
<li>The product owner takes that vision and breaks it down into a list of features yet to be implemented called the <strong>backlog</strong>.</li>
<li>The product owner manages the backlog through a process called <strong>grooming</strong> which leaves the list in a prioritized order.</li>
<li>The development process begins with an activity named <strong>sprint planning</strong> which culminates in the team forecasting how many features they will be able to complete within a predetermined amount of time.</li>
<li>Once planning ends, the Scrum team attempts to complete the features that that they forecasted they could complete. Each day during sprint execution, the team members help coordinate their work through am inspection, synchronization, and adaptive planning activity known as the <strong>daily scrum</strong>. (Notice the lowercase “s” in “daily scrum”.)</li>
<li>The team completes the Sprint by performing two more inspection and adaptation activities: the <strong>show and tell</strong> and the <strong>sprint retrospective</strong>. The outcome of these activities can alter the way the team decides to complete their work in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>The time that it takes to perform steps 4, 5, and 6 is the predetermined amount of time called a <strong>sprint</strong>. A sprint normally lasts from one week to one month depending on how the team has implemented Scrum.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-backlog">The product backlog</h3>
<p>All Agile software development methodologies try to do the most valuable or the most complex work first. The product owner, with input from the rest of the Scrum team (and bosses), determines and manages this sequnce of work by communicating it to the Scrum master and development team through the prioritized list known as the <em>product backlog</em>. When creating new products, usually the product owner fills the backlog with features that are required to meet the vision of the product for it to go to market. For on-going product development (maintenance mode), the product backlog will usually contain new features combined with changes to existing features, bugs that need repairing, fixes to technical debt, and more,</p>
<p>The product owner gathers the priorities of external and internal stakeholders to define the items in the product backlog. Based on those priorities, the product owner orders the items in the product backlog so that the high-value items appear at the top of the product backlog. The product owner grooms the backlog in that manner as often as necessary to make sure that the highest priority items are always at the top of the list.</p>
<h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>
<p>In Scrum, work is performed in iterations or cycles of up to a month called sprints. The work completed in each sprint should create something of tangible value for the people that use the software.</p>
<p>Sprints are <strong>timeboxed</strong> so they always have a fixed start and end date. They are usually all the same duration. A new sprint immediately follows the completion of an old sprint. As a rule, the team does do not change the team members or what they work on during a sprint; however, business needs sometimes make it impossible to follow that rule.</p>
<h3 id="sprint-planning">Sprint planning</h3>
<p>A product backlog may represent many weeks or months of work, which is much more than can be completed in a single, short sprint. To determine the most important subset of product backlog items to build in the next sprint, the product owner, development team, and Scrum master perform <strong>sprint planning</strong>.</p>
<p>During sprint planning, the product owner and development team agree on a sprint goal that defines what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve. Using this goal, the development team reviews the product backlog and determines the high-priority items that the team can realistically accomplish in the upcoming sprint while working at a sustainable pace. It is important to note that the team agrees on what it believes to be its own sustainable pace. Some teams can work longer than others. Some teams have maintenance commitments. Each team has different demands on it.</p>
<p>To acquire confidence in what it can get done, many development teams break down each targeted feature into a set of tasks. The collection of these tasks, along with their associated product backlog items, forms a second backlog called the <strong>sprint backlog</strong>.</p>
<p>The development team then provides an estimate (typically in hours) of the effort required to complete each <em>task</em>. Breaking product backlog items into tasks is a form of design and just-in-time planning for how to get the features done.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-sprint">Running the sprint</h2>
<p>Once the Scrum team finishes sprint planning and determines the features that it will complete in the next sprint, the development team, guided by the Scrum master’s coaching, performs all of the task-level work necessary to get the features done. “Done” means that the software developers have performed tasks to ensure the highest quality of software, and that the product owner has approved each feature’s completion.</p>
<p>Nobody tells the development team in what order or how to do the task-level work in the sprint backlog. Instead, team members define their own task-level work and then self-organize in any manner they feel is best for achieving the sprint goal.</p>
<h3 id="daily-scrum">Daily scrum</h3>
<p>Each day of the sprint, ideally at the same time, the development team members hold a short (15 minutes or less) <strong>daily scrum</strong>. This activity is often referred to as the <strong>daily stand-up</strong> because of the common practice of everyone standing up during the meeting to help promote brevity.</p>
<p>A common approach to performing the daily scrum has each team member taking turns answering three questions for the benefit of the other team members:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I accomplish yesterday?</li>
<li>What do I hope to accomplish today?</li>
<li>What obstacles or impediments prevent me from making progress?</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions, everyone understands the big picture of what is occurring, how they are progressing toward the sprint goal, any modifications they want to make to their plans for the upcoming day’s work, and what issues need to be addressed. The daily scrum is essential for helping the development team manage the fast, flexible flow of work within a sprint.</p>
<p>The daily scrum is <em>not</em> a problem-solving activity. Rather, many teams decide to talk about problems <em>after</em> the daily scrum. They will form small groups of interested people. The daily scrum also is not a traditional status meeting. A daily scrum, however, can be useful to communicate the status of sprint backlog items among the development team members. Mainly, the daily scrum is an inspection, synchronization, and adaptive daily planning activity that helps a self-organizing team do its job better.</p>
<h3 id="done">Done</h3>
<p>In Scrum, the sprint results should be “shippable” software, meaning that whatever the Scrum team agreed to do is really done according to its agreed-upon definition of done. This definition specifies the degree of confidence that the work completed is of good quality and is potentially shippable. For example, when developing software, a bare-minimum definition of done should yield a complete slice of product functionality that is designed, built, integrated, tested, and documented.</p>
<p>A holistic definition of done enables the business to decide each sprint if it wants to make the software available to its customers, internal or external.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, over time some teams may vary the definition of done. For example, in the early stages of game development, having features that are potentially shippable might not be economically feasible or desirable (given the exploratory nature of early game development). In these situations, an appropriate definition of done might be a slice of product functionality that is sufficiently functional and usable to generate feedback that enables the team to decide what work should be done next or how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="show-and-tell">Show and tell</h3>
<p>Show and tell gives the opportunity for everyone on the team to see what has been created. In the case of many Scrum teams working in concert, this provides a way for teams to see the work performed by other team. Critical to this activity is the conversation that takes place among its participants, which include the Scrum team, stakeholders, sponsors, customers, and interested members of other teams. The conversation is focused on reviewing the just-com- pleted features in the context of the overall development effort. Everyone in attendance gets clear visibility into what is occurring and has an opportunity to help guide the forthcoming development to ensure that the most business-appropriate solution is created.</p>
<p>A successful review results in information flowing in both directions. The people who aren’t on the Scrum team get to sync up on the development effort and help guide its direction. At the same time, the Scrum team members gain a deeper appreciation for the business and marketing side of their product by getting frequent feedback on the growth of the product. The show and tell therefore represents a scheduled opportunity to inspect and adapt the product.</p>
<h3 id="sprint-retrospective">Sprint retrospective</h3>
<p>The other activity at the end of the sprint is the <strong>sprint retrospective</strong>. It frequently occurs after the show and tell and before the next sprint planning.</p>
<p>Whereas the show and tell is a time to inspect and adapt the product, the sprint retrospective is an opportunity to inspect and adapt the process. During the sprint retrospective the development team, Scrum master, and product owner come together to discuss what is and is not working with all of the development practices. The focus is on the continuous process improvement necessary to help a good Scrum team become great. At the end of a sprint retrospective the Scrum team should have identified and committed to a practical number of process improvement actions, actions that they will enact during the next sprint.</p>
<p>After the sprint retrospective is completed, the whole cycle is repeated again— starting with the next sprint-planning session, held to determine the current highest- value set of work for the team to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learned">What you learned</h2>
<p>You learned that Scrum is a framework that teams can use to build a sustainable product-development process. The framework defines</p>
<ul>
<li>The product owner as the person that directs the highest priority development of the product</li>
<li>The Scrum master that helps the team follow its process and be most efficient</li>
<li>The development team that completes the work that the product owner specifies</li>
<li>The sprint, some amount of time during which the Scrum process is run</li>
<li>Sprint planning which provides the road map for what to accomplish during a sprint</li>
<li>The daily scrum, a meeting that the Scrum team attends to communicate its activities and blockers</li>
<li>The show and tell which allows a larger group visibility into the products of the sprint</li>
<li>The retrospective, which allows the team to determine process improvements</li>
<li>Backlog grooming performed by the product owner to ensure that the backlog of stories is well ordered and defined</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the framework of Scrum, the most popular Agile software development methodology in use today.</p>

<h1 id="lets-talk-about-sprints">Let’s Talk About Sprints</h1>
<p>Scrum organizes work in iterations or cycles of up to a calendar month called sprints. This reading provides a more detailed description of a sprint. It then discusses several key characteristics of sprints</p>
<ul>
<li>That they are timeboxed;</li>
<li>That they have a short and consistent duration</li>
<li>That they have an unalterable goal; and,</li>
<li>That they can only conclude using the team’s definition of done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although each team or company will have its own unique implementation of Scrum, these sprint characteristics, with few exceptions, are meant to apply to every sprint and every team.</p>
<h2 id="put-your-sprint-in-a-pretty-timebox">Put your sprint in a pretty timebox</h2>
<p>Sprints are rooted in the concept of <strong>timeboxing</strong>, a time-management technique that helps organize the performance of work and manage scope. Each sprint takes place in a time frame with specific start and end dates, called a <strong>timebox</strong>. Inside this timebox, the team is expected to work at a sustainable pace to complete a chosen set of work that aligns with a sprint goal. Timeboxing is important for several reasons.</p>
<p>A reason to timebox is to <em>establish work-in-progress (WIP) limits</em>. WIP represents an inventory of work that is started but not yet finished. Failing to properly manage it can have serious economic consequences. Because the team will plan to work on only those items that it believes it can start and finish within the sprint, timeboxing establishes a WIP limit each sprint.</p>
<p>Timeboxing forces the team to <em>prioritize</em> and perform the small amount of work that matters most. This sharpens the team’s focus on getting something valuable done quickly.</p>
<p>Timeboxing also helps us <em>demonstrate relevant progress</em> by completing and validating important pieces of work by a known date (the end of the sprint). This type of progress reduces risk by shifting the focus away from unreliable forms of progress reporting, such as conformance to a project plan. Timeboxing also helps to demonstrate progress against big features that require more than one timebox to complete. Completing some work toward those features ensures that valuable, measurable progress is being made each sprint. It also helps the stakeholders and team learn exactly what remains to be done to deliver the entire feature.</p>
<p>Timeboxing helps <em>avoid unnecessary perfectionism</em>. At one time or another people spend too much time trying to get something “perfect” when “good enough” would suffice. Timeboxing forces an end to potentially unbounded work by establishing a fixed end date for the sprint by which a good solution must be done.</p>
<p>Timeboxing also <em>motivates closure</em>. Teams can focus on getting things done when they have a known end date. The fact that the end of the sprint brings with it a hard deadline encourages team members to diligently apply themselves to complete the work on time. Without a known end date, there is less of a sense of urgency to complete the job.</p>
<p>Timeboxing <em>improves predictability</em>. Although we can’t predict with great certainty exactly the work we will complete a year from now, it is completely reasonable to expect that we can predict the work we can complete in the next short sprint.</p>
<h2 id="take-advantage-of-this-short-term-deal">Take advantage of this short-term deal!</h2>
<p>Short-duration sprints make it <em>easier to plan</em>. It is easier to plan a few weeks’ worth of work than six months’ worth of work. Also, planning on such short time spans requires far less effort and is far more accurate than longer-term planning.</p>
<p>Short-duration sprints <em>generate fast feedback</em>. During each sprint, the team creates working software. Then, they have the opportunity to inspect and adapt what was built and how they built it. This fast feedback enables the team to quickly prune unfavorable product paths or development approaches before those choices can compound a bad decision with many follow-on decisions that are coupled to the bad decision. Fast feedback also allows us to more quickly uncover and exploit time-sensitive emergent opportunities.</p>
<p>Short-duration sprints not only improve the economics via fast feedback; they also allow for <em>early and more frequent deliverables</em>. As a result, the company can have the opportunity to generate revenue sooner, improving the overall return on investment.</p>
<p>Short-duration sprints also <em>bound error</em>. How wrong can a team get in a two-week sprint? Even if the team does everything wrong, the group has lost only two weeks. Scrum insists on short-duration sprints because they provide frequent coordination and feedback. That way, if the team gets something wrong, then they get something wrong in only a small way.</p>
<p>Short-duration sprints also provide <em>multiple, meaningful checkpoints</em>. One valued aspect of sequential projects is a well-defined set of “milestones”. These milestones provide managers with expectations about what should be delivered by a certain date. If things don’t happen by that date, it allows the team to decide if the project should continue. Although potentially useful from a governance perspective, these milestones give an unreliable indication of the true status of a project.</p>
<p>Scrum provides managers, stakeholders, product owners, and others with many more checkpoints than they would have with sequential projects. At the end of each short sprint, there is a meaningful checkpoint (the show and tell) that allows everyone to base decisions on demonstrable, working features. People are better able to deal with a complex environment when they have more actionable checkpoint opportunities to inspect and adapt.</p>
<h2 id="the-duration-remains-the-same">The duration remains the same</h2>
<p>As a rule, on a given development effort, a team should pick a consistent duration for its sprints and not change it unless there is a compelling reason. Compelling reasons might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your team may move from one-month sprints to two-week sprints in order to obtain more frequent feedback</li>
<li>The annual holidays or end of the fiscal year make it more practical to run a longer sprint</li>
<li>The product release occurs in one week, so a two-week sprint would be incongruous</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the team cannot get all the work done within the current sprint length is not a compelling reason to extend the sprint length. Neither is it permissible to get to the last day of the sprint, realize you are not going to be done, and lobby for an extra day or week. These are symptoms of dysfunction and opportunities for improvement; they are not good reasons to change the sprint length.</p>
<p>As a rule, therefore, if a team agrees to perform two-week sprints, all sprints should be two weeks in duration. As a practical matter, most (but not all) teams will define two weeks to mean ten calendar weekdays. If there is a one-day holiday or training event during the sprint, it reduces the team’s capacity for that sprint but doesn’t necessitate a sprint length change.</p>
<h3 id="the-metronome-effect">The metronome effect</h3>
<p>Sprints of the same duration provide the team with <strong>cadence</strong>, a regular, predictable rhythm or heartbeat to a Scrum development effort. A steady, healthy heartbeat allows the Scrum team and the organization to acquire an important rhythmic familiarity with when things need to happen to achieve the fast, flexible flow of business value. Having a regular cadence to sprints enables people to “get into the zone,” “be on a roll,” or “get into a groove.”</p>
<p>Having a short sprint cadence also tends to level out the intensity of work. Unlike a traditional sequential project where we see a steep increase in intensity in the latter phases, each sprint has a similar intensity to that of the other sprints.</p>
<p>Sprinting on a regular cadence also significantly reduces coordination overhead. With fixed-length sprints everyone can predictably schedule the sprint-planning, sprint review, and sprint retrospective activities for many sprints at the same time. Because everyone knows when the activities will occur, the overhead required to schedule them for a large batch of sprints is substantially reduced.</p>
<p>As an example, if you work on two-week sprints on a yearlong development effort, you can send out the recurring event on everyone’s calendar for the next 26 sprint reviews. If you allowed sprint durations to vary from sprint to sprint, imagine the extra effort you would need to coordinate the schedules of the stakeholders on what might be just one or two weeks’ notice for an upcoming sprint review! That assumes that you could even find a time that worked for the core set of stakeholders, whose schedules are likely filled up many weeks ahead.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-your-eye-on-the-goal">Keeping your eye on the goal</h2>
<p>An important Scrum rule states that once the sprint goal has been established and sprint execution has begun, no change is permitted that can materially affect the sprint goal.</p>
<p>Each sprint can be summarized by a sprint goal that describes the business purpose and value of the sprint. Typically the sprint goal has a clear, single focus, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support customer service with new tooling</li>
<li>Load and curate new geophysical data</li>
<li>Integrate a new billing process into the application</li>
</ul>
<p>There are times when a sprint goal might be multifaceted, for example, “Get large-screen support working and support search by customer name.”</p>
<p>During sprint planning, the development team should help refine and agree to the sprint goal and use it to determine the product backlog items that it can complete by the end of the sprint. These product backlog items serve to further elaborate the sprint goal.</p>
<h3 id="we-commit-to-one-another">We commit to one another</h3>
<p>The sprint goal is the foundation of a mutual commitment made by the team and the product owner. The team commits to meeting the goal by the end of the sprint, and the product owner commits to not altering the goal during the sprint.</p>
<p>This mutual commitment demonstrates the importance of sprints in balancing the needs of the business to be adaptive to change, while allowing the team to concentrate and efficiently apply its talent to create value during a short, fixed duration. By defining and adhering to a sprint goal, the Scrum team is able to stay focused on a well-defined, valuable target.</p>
<h3 id="clarifying-the-goal-should-not-change-the-goal">Clarifying the goal should not change the goal</h3>
<p>Although the sprint goal should not be materially changed, it is permissible to clarify the goal.</p>
<p>What constitutes a change? A change is any alteration in work or resources that has the potential to generate meaningful wasted effort, egregiously disrupt the flow of work, or substantially increase the scope of work within a sprint. Adding or removing a product backlog item from a sprint or significantly altering the scope of a product backlog item that is already in the sprint typically constitutes change. The following example illustrates a change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Product owner: “Hey! When I said that we need to be able to search the inventory database by product name or description, I also meant that we should be able to search for it by a picture of the product!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding the ability to search based on a picture likely represents substantially more effort and almost certainly would affect the team’s ability to meet a commitment to deliver search based on a name and description. In this case, the product owner should consider creating a new product backlog item that captures the search-by-picture feature. Then, they can add it to the product backlog to be worked on in a later sprint.</p>
<p>What constitutes a clarification? Clarifications are additional details provided during the sprint that assist the team in achieving its sprint goal. All of the details associated with product backlog items might not be fully known or specified at the start of the sprint. Therefore, it is completely reasonable for the team to ask clarifying questions during a sprint and for the product owner to answer those questions. The following example illustrates a clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Development team: "When you said that the matches for a product search should be displayed ina list, did you have a preference for how the list should be sorted?</p>
<p>Product owner: “Yeah, by product name.”</p>
<p>Development team: “Great! We can do that!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-weight-of-change">The weight of change</h3>
<p>It may appear that the no-goal-altering-change rule is in direct conflict with the core Scrum principle that teams should embrace change. Though teams do embrace change, they want to embrace it in a balanced, economically sensible way.</p>
<p>The team invests in product backlog items to get them ready to be worked on in a sprint. However, once a sprint starts, that investment in those product backlog items has increased (because everyone spent time during sprint planning to discuss and plan them at a task level). If someone wants to make a change after sprint planning has occurred, they not only jeopardize the planning investment, but the team also incur additional costs for having to replan any changes during the sprint.</p>
<p>In addition, once we begin sprint execution, our investment in work increases even more as product backlog items transition through the states of to do (work not yet started), doing (work in process), and done (work completed).</p>
<p>Let’s say the product owner want to swap out feature X, currently part of the sprint commitment, and substitute feature Y, which isn’t part of the existing commitment. Even if no one has started working on feature X, the team still incurs planning waste. In addition, feature X might also have dependencies with other features in the sprint, so a change that affects feature X could affect one or more other features, thus amplifying the negative effect on the sprint goal.</p>
<p>Continuing that analysis, if work on feature X has already begun, in addition to the wasted work completed, there can be other potential wastes. For example, all of the work already performed on feature X might have to be thrown away. And the team might have the additional waste of removing the partially completed work on feature X, which may never get used in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct economic consequences of waste, the economics can be indirectly affected by the potential deterioration of team motivation and trust that can accompany a change to a sprint. When the product owner makes a commitment to not alter the goal and then violates the commitment, the team naturally will be demotivated, which will almost certainly affect its desire to work diligently to complete other prod- uct backlog items. In addition, violating the commitment can harm the trust within the Scrum team, because the development team will not trust that the product owner is willing to stick to his commitments.</p>
<h3 id="pragmatism-in-the-face-of-perfection">Pragmatism in the face of perfection</h3>
<p>The rule to not change a sprint goal is just that: a rule, not a law. The Scrum team has to be pragmatic.</p>
<p>What if business conditions change in such a way that making a change to the sprint goal seems warranted? Say a competitor launches its new product during a sprint. After reviewing the new product, the product owner concludes that the team needs to alter the goal it established for the current sprint because the current tasks the team is doing is now far less valuable given what the competitor has done. Should the team blindly follow the rule of no goal-altering changes and not alter the sprint? Probably not.</p>
<p>What if a critical production system has failed miserably and some or all of the people on the development team are the only ones who can fix it? Should the team not interrupt the current sprint to fix it? Does the team tell the business that they will fix the production failure first thing next sprint? Probably not.</p>
<p>In the end, being pragmatic trumps the “do not mess with the sprint” rule. The team must act in a sensible way. Everyone on the Scrum team can appreciate that. If the team changes the current sprint, they will experience the negative economic consequences previously discussed. However, if the economic consequences of the change are far less than the economic consequences of deferring the change, making the change is the smart business decision. If the economics of changing versus not changing are immaterial, no change to the sprint goal should be made.</p>
<p>As for team motivation and trust, when a product owner has a frank, economically focused discussion with the team about the necessity of the change, most teams understand and appreciate the need, so the integrity of motivation and trust is upheld.</p>
<h3 id="stopping-the-sprint-before-the-box-is-full">Stopping the sprint before the box is full</h3>
<p>Should the sprint goal become completely invalid, the Scrum team may decide that continuing with the current sprint makes no sense and advise the product owner to abnormally terminate the sprint. When a sprint is abnormally terminated, the current sprint comes to an abrupt end and the Scrum team gathers to perform a sprint retrospective. The team then meets with the product owner to plan the next sprint, with a different goal and a different set of product backlog items.</p>
<p>Sprint termination is used when an economically significant event has occurred, such as a competitor’s actions that completely invalidate the sprint or product funding being materially changed.</p>
<p>Although the product owner reserves the option to cancel each and every sprint, it is rare that product owners invoke this option. Often there are less drastic measures that a Scrum team can take to adjust to the situation at hand. Remember, sprints are short, and, on average, the team will be about halfway through a sprint when a change-causing situation arises. Because there may be only a week or so of time left in the sprint when the change occurs, the economics of terminating may be less favorable than just staying the course. And many times it is possible to make a less dramatic change, such as dropping a feature to allow time to fix a critical production failure instead of ending the sprint.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that ending the sprint early, in addition to having a negative effect on morale, is a serious disruption of the fast, flexible flow of features and negates many of the benefits of consistent-duration sprints. Terminating a sprint should be the last resort.</p>
<p>If a sprint is ended early, the Scrum team needs to decide the length of the next sprint. Normally, there are three options. In a multi-team development effort, choosing option 1 or option 2 is the preferred method.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make the next sprint bigger than a normal sprint to cover the remaining time in the terminated sprint plus the time for the next full sprint.</li>
<li>Make the next sprint just long enough to get to the end date of the terminated sprint.</li>
<li>Stay with the original sprint length. This has the advantage of keeping a uniform sprint length throughout development (except for the terminated sprint, of course).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-done">What is “done”?</h2>
<p>Conceptually the <strong>definition of done</strong> is a checklist of the types of work that the team is expected to successfully complete before it can declare its work to be ready for deployment for use.</p>
<p>Most of the time, a bare-minimum definition of done should yield a complete slice of product functionality, one that has been designed, built, integrated, tested, and documented and would deliver validated customer value. To have a useful checklist, however, these larger-level work items need to be further refined. For example, what does “tested” mean? Unit tested? Integration tested? System tested? Platform tested? Internationalization tested? Are all of those types of testing included in the definition of done?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you don’t do an important type of testing every sprint (say, performance testing), you’ll have to do it sometime. Are you going to have some specialized sprint in the future where the only thing you do is performance testing? If so, and performance testing is essential to being“done,” you really don’t have a usable product each sprint. And even worse, when you actually do the performance testing at a later time and it doesn’t go quite as planned, not only will you discover a critical problem very late in the process, but you will also have to spend much more time and money to fix it at that time than if you had done the performance testing earlier.</p>
<p>Sometimes the testing might take longer than the duration of a sprint. If this occurs because the development team has accrued a huge manual testing debt, the team needs to start automating its tests so that the testing can be completed within a sprint like with the <code>mocha</code> library used in this course to write unit tests for JavaScript applications.</p>
<p>Scrum teams need to have a robust definition of done, one that provides a high level of confidence that what they build is of high quality and can be shipped. Anything less robs the organization of the business opportunity of shipping at its discretion and can lead to the accrual of <strong>technical debt</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-evolution-of-done">The evolution of done</h3>
<p>You can think of the definition of done as defining the state of the work at the end of the sprint. For many high-performance teams, the target end state of the work enables it to be potentially shippable and that end state remains relatively constant over the product’s development.</p>
<p>Many teams, start out with a definition of done that doesn’t end in a state where all features are completed to the extent that they could go live or be shipped. For some, real impediments might prevent them from reaching this state at the start of development, even though it is the ultimate goal. As a result, they might start with a lesser end state and let their definition of done evolve over time as organizational impediments are removed.</p>
<h3 id="done-and-done-done">Done and “done done”</h3>
<p>Some teams have adopted the concept of “done” versus “done done.” Somehow done- done is supposed to be more done than done! Teams that are unaccustomed to really getting things done early and often are more likely to use “done done” as a crutch. For them, using “done done” makes the point that being done (doing as much work as they are prepared to do) is a different state from “done done” (doing the work required for customers to believe it is done). Teams that have internalized that you can be done only if you did all the work necessary to satisfy customers don’t need to have two states; to them, done means “done done”!</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned-9">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>In this reading, you learned a lot more about sprints. You now know that sprints</p>
<ul>
<li>are timeboxed;</li>
<li>have a short and consistent duration</li>
<li>have an unalterable goal; and,</li>
<li>can only conclude using the team’s definition of done.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="requirements-and-user-stories">Requirements and User Stories</h1>
<p>Scrum treats requirements very differently than traditional project planning. With traditional product development, requirements are nonnegotiable, detailed up front, and meant to stand alone. In Scrum, the details of a requirement are negotiated through conversations that happen continuously during development and are fleshed out just in time and just enough for the teams to start building functionality to support that requirement.</p>
<p>With traditional product development, requirements are treated much as they are in manufacturing: they are required, nonnegotiable specifications to which the product must conform. These requirements are created up front and given to the development group in the form of a highly detailed document. It is the job of the development group, then, to produce a product that conforms to the detailed requirements.</p>
<p>When a change from the original plan is deemed necessary, it is managed through a formal change control process. Because conformance to specifications is the goal, these deviations are undesirable and expensive. After all, much of the work in process (WIP), in the form of highly detailed requirements (and all work based on them), might need to be changed or discarded.</p>
<p>In contrast, Scrum views requirements as an important degree of freedom that we can manipulate to meet our business goals. For example, if the product team is running out of time or money, they can drop low-value requirements. If, during development, new information indicates that the cost/benefit ratio of a requirement has become significantly less favorable, that requirement can be chosen to be dropped from the product. And if a new high-value requirement emerges, the team has the ability to add it to the product, perhaps discarding a lower-value requirement to make room.</p>
<p>The fact is, when developing innovative products, no one can create complete requirements or designs up front by simply working longer and harder. Some requirements and design will always emerge once product development is under way; no amount of comprehensive up-front work will prevent that.</p>
<p>Thus, when using Scrum, the team doesn’t invest a great deal of time and money in fleshing out the details of a requirement up front. Because the team expects the specifics to change as time passes and as it learns more about what is being built, the team avoids overinvesting in requirements that might later be discarded. Instead of compiling a large inventory of detailed requirements up front, the Scrum team create placeholders for the requirements, called product backlog items (PBIs). Each product backlog item represents desirable business value usually in the form of some desired functionality.</p>
<p>Initially the product backlog items are large (representing large swaths of business value), and there is very little detail associated with them. Over time, the team flows these product backlog items through a series of conversations among the stakeholders, product owner, and development team, refining them into a collection of smaller, more detailed PBIs. Eventually a product backlog item is small and detailed enough to move into a sprint, where it will be designed, built, and tested. Even during the sprint, however, more details will be exposed in conversations between the product owner and the development team.</p>
<p>While Scrum doesn’t specify any standard format for these product backlog items, many teams represent PBIs as <strong>user stories</strong>. You don’t have to. Some teams prefer “use case” format, and others choose to represent their PBIs in their own custom formats.</p>
<h2 id="a-pbi-is-a-conversation-waiting-to-happen">A PBI is a conversation waiting to happen</h2>
<p>As a communication vehicle, requirements facilitate a shared understanding of what needs to be built. They allow the people who understand what should be created to clearly communicate their desires to the people who have to create it.</p>
<p>Traditional product development relies heavily on written requirements, which look impressive but can easily be misunderstood. A way to better ensure that the desired features are being built is for the people who know what they want to have timely conversations with the people who are designing, building, and testing those features.</p>
<p>Scrum leverages conversation as a key tool for ensuring that requirements are properly discussed and communicated. Verbal communication has the benefit of being high-bandwidth and providing fast feedback, making it easier and cheaper to gain a shared understanding. In addition, conversations enable bidirectional communication that can spark ideas about problems and opportunities. Those are discussions that would not likely arise from reading a document.</p>
<p>Conversation, however, is just a tool. It doesn’t replace all documents. In Scrum, the product backlog is a “living document,” available at all times during product development. Those who still want or must have a requirements specification document can create one at any time, simply by collecting the product backlog items and all of their associated details into a document formatted however they like.</p>
<h2 id="refining-the-refinements">Refining the refinements</h2>
<p>With traditional product development all requirements must be at the same level of detail at the same time. In particular, the approved requirements document must specify each and every requirement so that the teams doing the design, build, and test work can understand how to conform to the specifications. There are no details left to be added.</p>
<p>Forcing all requirements to the same level of detail at the same time has many disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must predict all of the details early during product development when they have the least knowledge that they’ll ever have about the prodcut and market.</li>
<li>They treat all requirements the same regardless of their priority.</li>
<li>They create a huge inventory of requirements that will likely be very expensive to rework or discard.</li>
<li>They reduce the likelihood of using conversations to elaborate and clarify requirements because the requirements are “complete”.</li>
</ul>
<p>when using Scrum, not all requirements have to be at the same level of detail at the same time. Requirements that the team will work on sooner will be smaller and more detailed than ones that won’t be worked on for some time. Employing this strategy of progressive refinement allows the entire team to work in a just-in-time fashion.</p>
<h2 id="user-stories">User stories</h2>
<p>User stories are a convenient format for expressing the desired business value for many types of product backlog items, especially features. User stories are crafted in a way that makes them understandable to both business people and technical people. They are structurally simple and provide a great placeholder for a conversation. Additionally, they can be written at various levels of granularity and are easy to progressively refine.</p>
<p>As well adapted to the needs of a development team as user stories might be, don’t consider them to be the only way to represent product backlog items. They are simply a lightweight approach that dovetails nicely with core agile principles and our need for an efficient and effective placeholder.</p>
<p>So what exactly are user stories? Ron Jeffries offers a simple yet effective way to think about user stories. He describes them as the three Cs: card, conversation, and confirmation.</p>
<h3 id="the-card">The card</h3>
<p>The card idea is pretty simple. People originally wrote (and many still do) user stories directly on 3 × 5-inch index cards or sticky notes.</p>
<p>A common template format for writing user stories uses the “Conextra format” known as the “as a-I want-so that” format. That format specifies a class of users (the user role), what that class of users wants to achieve (the goal), and why the users want to achieve the goal (the benefit). The “so that” part of a user story is optional, but unless the purpose of the story is completely obvious to everyone, it should be included with every user story.</p>

<p><strong>As a</strong> typical member, <strong>I want</strong> to see unbiased reviews of a restaurant near an address <strong>so that</strong> I can decide where to go for dinner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The card isn’t intended to capture all of the information that makes up the requirement. In fact, most agile methodologies deliberately use small cards with limited space to promote brevity. A card should hold a few sentences that capture the essence or intent of a requirement. It serves as the placeholder for more detailed discussions that will take place among the stakeholders, product owner, and development team.</p>
<h3 id="the-conversation">The conversation</h3>
<p>The details of a requirement are exposed and communicated in a conversation among the development team, product owner, and stakeholders. The user story is simply a promise to have that conversation.</p>
<p>The conversation is typically not a one-time event, but rather an ongoing dialogue. There can be an initial conversation when the user story is written, another conversation when it’s refined, yet another when it’s estimated, another during sprint planning (when the team is diving into the task-level details), and finally, ongoing conversations while the user story is being designed, built, and tested during the sprint.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of user stories is that they shift some of the focus away from writing and onto conversations. These conversations enable a richer form of exchanging information and collaborating to ensure that the correct requirements are expressed and understood by everyone.</p>
<p>Although conversations are largely verbal, they can be and frequently are supplemented with documents. Conversations may lead to a UI sketch, or an elaboration of business rules that gets written down. Scrum does not do away with all other documentation in favor of user stories. User stories are simply a good starting point for eliciting the essence of the requirement.</p>
<h3 id="the-confirmation">The confirmation</h3>
<p>A user story also contains confirmation information in the form of conditions of satisfaction. These are acceptance criteria that clarify the desired behavior. They are used by the development team to better understand what to build and test and by the product owner to confirm that the user story has been implemented to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>If the team uses physical index cards, the front of the card has a few-line description of the story, the back of the card could specify the conditions of satisfaction.</p>
<p>These conditions of satisfaction can be expressed as high-level acceptance tests. However, these tests would not be the only tests that are run when the story is being developed. In fact, for the handful of acceptance tests that are associated with a user story, the team will have many more tests (perhaps 10 to 100 times more) at a detailed technical level that the product owner doesn’t even know about.</p>
<p>The acceptance tests associated with the story exist for several reasons. First, they are an important way to capture and communicate, from the product owner’s perspective, how to determine if the story has been implemented correctly.</p>
<p>These tests can also be a helpful way to create initial stories and refine them as more details become known.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-detail-is-enough">How much detail is enough?</h2>
<p>User stories are an excellent vehicle for carrying items of customer or user value through the Scrum value-creation flow. However, if your team has only one story size (the size that would comfortably fit within a short-duration sprint), it will be difficult to do higher-level planning and to reap the benefits of progressive refinement.</p>
<p>Small stories used at the sprint level are too small and too numerous to support higher-level product and release planning. At these levels you need fewer, less detailed, more abstract items. Otherwise, you’ll be mired in a swamp of mostly irrelevant detail. Imagine having 500 very small stories and being asked to provide an executive-level description of the proposed product to secure your funding. Or try to prioritize among those 500 really small items to define the next release.</p>
<p>Also, if there is only one (small) size of story, we will be obligated to define all requirements at a very fine-grained level of detail long before we should. Having only small stories precludes the benefit of progressively refining requirements on a just- enough, just-in-time basis.</p>
<p>Fortunately, user stories can be written to capture customer and user needs at various levels of abstraction. The largest would be stories that are a few to many months in size and might span an entire release or multiple releases. Many people refer to these as <strong>epics</strong>, alluding to the idea that they are Lord of the Rings or War and Peace size stories. Epics are helpful because they give a very big-picture, high-level overview of what is desired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Epic</strong>: As someone that regularly uses the restaurant review product, I want to train the system on what types of cuisine I prefer so that it will know what restaurants to use when filtering reviews on my behalf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would never move an epic into a sprint for development because it is way too big and not very detailed. Instead, epics are excellent placeholders for a large collection of more detailed stories to be created at an appropriate future time.</p>
<p>The next-size stories are those that are often on the order of weeks in size and therefore too big for a single sprint. Some teams might call these <strong>features</strong>.</p>
<p>The smallest forms of user stories are those typically refered to as <strong>stories</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="good-stories-are-investments">Good stories are INVESTments</h2>
<p>Good user stories exhibit six aspects. They are</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent of one another</li>
<li>Negotiable</li>
<li>Valuable to the people using the product</li>
<li>Estimable by the development team</li>
<li>Small enough to fit in a sprint</li>
<li>Testable to know when its done</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="celebrate-your-independence">Celebrate your independence</h3>
<p>As much as is practical, user stories should be independent or at least only loosely coupled with one another. Stories that exhibit a high degree of interdependence com- plicate estimating, prioritizing, and planning. When applying the independent criteria, the goal is not to eliminate all dependencies, but instead to write stories in a way that minimizes dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="negotiate-for-profit">Negotiate for profit</h3>
<p>The details of stories should also be negotiable. Stories are not a written contract in the form of an up-front requirements document. Instead, stories are placeholders for the conversations where the details will be negotiated.</p>
<p>Good stories clearly capture the essence of what business functionality is desired and why it is desired. However, they leave room for the product owner, the stakeholders, and the team to negotiate the details.</p>
<p>This negotiability helps everyone involved avoid the us-versus-them, finger- pointing mentality that is commonplace with detailed up-front requirements docu- ments. When stories are negotiable, developers can’t really say, “Hey, if you wanted it, you should have put it in the document,” because the details are going to be negoti- ated with the developers. And the business people can’t really say, “Hey, you obviously didn’t understand the requirements document because you built the wrong thing,” because the business people will be in frequent dialogue with the developers to make sure there is shared clarity. Writing negotiable stories avoids the problems associated with up-front detailed requirements by making it clear that a dialogue is necessary.</p>
<p>A common example of where negotiability is violated is when the product owner tells the team how to implement a story. Stories should be about what and why, not how. When the how becomes nonnegotiable, opportunities for the team to be innovative are diminished.</p>
<p>There are times, however, when how something is built is actually important to the product owner. For example, there might be a regulatory obligation to develop a feature in a particular way, or there might be a business constraint directing the use of a specific technology. In such cases the stories will be a bit less negotiable because some aspect of the “how” is required. That’s OK; not all stories are fully negotiable, but most stories should be.</p>
<h3 id="valuable-for-everyone">Valuable for everyone</h3>
<p>Stories need to be valuable to a customer, user, or both. Customers (or choosers) select and pay for the product. Users actually use the product. If a story isn’t valuable to either, it doesn’t belong in the product backlog.</p>
<p>How about stories that are valuable to the developers but aren’t of obvious value to the customers or users? Is it OK to have <strong>technical stories</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical story</strong>: As a developer, I want to migrate the system to work on the latest version of ReactJS so that we are not operating on a stale version of the UI library and get stuck in an expensive upgrade later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of the “Migrate to New Version of ReactJS” story, the product owner might not initially understand why it is valuable to change databases. However, once the team explains the risks of continuing to develop on an unsupported version of a database, the product owner might decide that migrating databases is valuable enough to defer building some new features until the migration is done. By understanding the value, the product owner can treat the technical story like any other business-valuable story and make informed trade-offs. As a result, this technical story might be included in the product backlog.</p>
<p>In practice, though, most technical stories should not be included in the product backlog. Instead, these types of stories should be tasks associated with getting normal stories done. If the development team has a strong definition of done, there should be no need to write stories like these, because the work is implied by the definition of being done.</p>
<h3 id="estimations-are-the-lifeblood-of-prediction">Estimations are the lifeblood of prediction</h3>
<p>Stories should be estimable by the team that will design, build, and test them. Estimates provide an indication of the size and therefore the effort and cost of the stories (bigger stories require more effort and therefore cost more money to develop than smaller stories).</p>
<p>Knowing a story’s size provides actionable information to the Scrum team. The product owner, for example, needs to know the cost of a story to determine its final priority in the product backlog. The Scrum team, on the other hand, can determine from the size of the story whether additional refinement or disaggregation is required. A large story that we plan to work on soon will need to be broken into a set of smaller stories.</p>
<p>If the team isn’t able to size a story, the story is either just too big or ambiguous to be sized, or the team doesn’t have enough knowledge to estimate a size. If it’s too big, the team will need to work with the product owner to break it into more manageable stories. If the team lacks knowledge, some form of exploratory activity will be needed to acquire the information.</p>
<h3 id="small-enough-to-accomplish">Small enough to accomplish</h3>
<p>Stories should be sized appropriately for when you plan to work on them. Stories worked on in sprints should be small. If you’re doing a several-week sprint, you will want to work on several stories that are each a few days in size. If you have a two-week sprint, you don’t want a two-week-size story, because the risk of not finishing the story is just too great.</p>
<p>So ultimately you need small stories, but just because a story is large, that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Let’s say you have an epic-size story that you aren’t planning to work on for another year. Arguably that story is sized appropriately for when you plan to work on it. In fact, if you spent time today breaking that epic down into a collection of smaller stories, it could easily be a complete waste of your time. Of course, if you have an epic that you want to work on in the next sprint, it’s not sized appropriately and you have more work to do to bring it down to size. You must consider when the story will be worked on when applying this criterion.</p>
<h3 id="test-makes-the-world-go-round">Test makes the world go ’round</h3>
<p>Stories should be testable in a binary way: they either pass or fail their associated tests. Being testable means having good acceptance criteria (related to the conditions of satisfaction) associated with the story, which is the “confirmation” aspect of a user story.</p>
<p>It may not always be necessary or possible to test a story. For example, epic-size stories probably don’t have tests associated with them, nor do they need them because you don’t directly build the epics.</p>
<p>Also, on occasion there might be a story that the product owner deems valuable, yet there might not be a practical way to test it. These are more likely to be so-called <strong>nonfunctional requirements</strong>, such as “As a user, I want the system to have 99.999% uptime.” Although the acceptance criteria might be clear, there may be no set of tests that can be run when the system is put into production that can prove that this level of uptime has been met, but the requirement is still valuable as it will drive the design.</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned-10">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>A hard thing is having proper requirements as a team to guide your work. In this reading, you learned about user stories and how they should be INVESTable. Some of this may not make sense, just now, and that’s ok. It will make sense as you run into more real-world requirements in this course, as well as when you move into real-world development scenarios.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="censor-project">Censor Project</h1>
<p>Time to practice some Node Input/Output! In this project, you’ll utilize both user I/O and file I/O to create a program that censors forbidden words that are specified in a dictionary file.</p>
<p>The solution for this project is available at the end of these instructions. Be sure to give it an honest shot before you take a peek!</p>
<h2 id="the-objective-1">The Objective</h2>
<p>Let’s begin by taking a bird’s-eye view of how the final product should behave. Let’s say that we had a <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code> containing the following words:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>potato
tomato
cat
strange
real
park</code></pre>
<p>When we execute the program, <code>censor.js</code>, the user will be prompted to enter a sentence. The program will respond with the same sentence, but with the forbidden words censored. A censored word will have its vowels replaced with stars (*). Below is an example of the program at runtime. For clarity, we have wrapped the user’s input in -dashes-:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node censor.js
Enter a sentence to be censored: -what a really strange place to park a car-
what a really str*ng* place to p*rk a car</code></pre>
<h2 id="phase-1-setting-up-and-censoring-sentences">Phase 1: Setting Up and Censoring Sentences</h2>
<p>We’ll be designing this project from scratch, so begin by creating directory named <code>censor-project</code> and <code>cd</code> into it. This will be our working directory for the duration of the project. Inside of your working directory, create two files: <code>censor.js</code> and <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code>. Your directory should have the following structure:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>/censor-project
├── censor.js
└── forbidden-dictionary.txt</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-dictionary">Creating a dictionary</h3>
<p>Inside of your <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code> use VSCode to write some words that we’ll eventually censor. For the rest of these instructions, you can assume that our <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code> contains exactly:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>potato
tomato
cat
strange
real
park</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have typed each forbidden word on it’s own line, be sure to do the same! Until phase 2, we’ll put this dictionary file to the side.</p>
<h3 id="censoring-sentences">Censoring Sentences</h3>
<p>Before we perform any I/O, let’s knock out the censoring behavior of our program. Our program should censor a word by replacing its vowels with stars (*). To keep things nice and tidy, create a function <code>starVowels</code> that accepts a word as an argument and returns that word with all of its vowels replaced with stars. We leave the implementation detail up to you. Your function should be able to satisfy the following examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb74"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">starVowels</span>(<span class="st">&quot;caterpillar&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;c*t*rp*ll*r&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">starVowels</span>(<span class="st">&quot;snowstorm&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;sn*wst*rm&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">starVowels</span>(<span class="st">&quot;programmer&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;pr*gr*mm*r&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Test your function thoroughly with the above test cases and feel free to test it with other arguments.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that we are assuming the <code>starVowels</code> function will be passed a single word <em>and not</em> a sentence containing many words. This is because our final product should be deliberate in <em>which</em> words will be targeted. <code>starVowels</code> is just a helper function that will be used within our main <code>censorSentence</code> function. Create a function named <code>censorSentence</code> that accepts two arguments: a sentence and an array of strings. The function should return a new sentence where words of the original sentence are censored if they are found inside of the array argument. You should use <code>starVowels</code> as a helper function, but we leave the rest of the implementation detail to you. You can assume that won’t contain any punctuation. Your <code>censorSentence</code> should satisfy the following behavior:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">censorSentence</span>(<span class="st">&quot;what a wonderful life&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> [<span class="st">&quot;wonderful&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;tree&quot;</span>]))<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-2" title="2"><span class="co">// &#39;what a w*nd*rf*l life&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-4" title="4"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-5" title="5">  <span class="at">censorSentence</span>(<span class="st">&quot;hey programmer why the long face&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> [</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-10" title="10">)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-11" title="11"><span class="co">//  &#39;h*y pr*gr*mm*r why the l*ng face&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Great! We’re done with the censoring logic of our program. Notice how we designed a <em>function</em> to perform the act of censoring. This keeps our code modular. We didn’t even have to deal with any I/O yet! In general, you’ll want to keep your code loosely coupled so that it is easy to test and maintain. Now that we have <code>censorSentence</code>, for the rest of the project we will concern ourselves with passing the arguments dynamically into <code>censorSentence</code>. That is, we have two open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>how can we get the sentence argument for <code>censorSentence</code> from the user?</li>
<li>how can we get the array argument for <code>censorSentence</code> from the dictionary file?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before moving onto the next phase, don’t forget to delete any test calls to <code>censorSentence</code>.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2-interacting-with-the-user">Phase 2: Interacting with the user</h2>
<p>Let’s tackle prompting the user for a sentence using the <code>readline</code> module. You’ve seen this pattern a few times now. Reference the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html">readline docs</a> to do three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>import the readline module</li>
<li>create an interface so that the terminal can be used for I/O</li>
<li>use the <code>question</code> method to ask the user to enter a sentence; once they hit enter, repeat the sentence to them and <code>close</code> the interface</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of how the program should behave if you have satisfied the three points above. For clarity, we’ve denoted the user’s input with -dashes-:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node censor.js
Enter a sentence to be censored: -hey programmers-
hey programmers</code></pre>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the user input, you can even begin to mock out how the user’s sentence will be modified. Instead of simply repeating their sentence once they hit enter, use your <code>censorSentence</code> function to censor some arbitrary words of their sentence. This means you’ll have to pass a hard-coded array as the second argument to <code>censorSentence</code>.</p>
<p>Just one more piece of the puzzle! Instead of using the static dictionary array that we just hard-coded, we’ll want to refactor our code to get this data from a separate file.</p>
<h2 id="phase-3-parsing-the-dictionary">Phase 3: Parsing the dictionary</h2>
<p>This part is tricky, so read the full instructions for this entire phase before writing any more code.</p>
<p>Our task now is to use the <code>fs</code> module to read the contents of the <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code> file that we created initially. To do this, feel free to reference the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback">docs for readFile</a> and our previous reading on file I/O. Like usual, you should use ‘utf8’ as the encoding and print any potential errors that may occur when the file is read.</p>
<p>Since both the readline <code>question</code> method and fs <code>readFile</code> method are asynchronous, you’ll need to utilize <em>callback chaining</em> in order to read the <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code> file <em>after</em> the user has entered their sentence. Recall that <em>callback chaining</em> is implemented by nesting callbacks. This means that you’ll have to call <code>readFile</code> from <em>within</em> the callback that is passed into <code>question</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that our <code>censorSentence</code> needs to be passed an array of strings to be censored as its second argument. However, if we read the contents of the <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code>, we will receive one long string that contains all of the words. You’ll need to reconcile this difference. How did we overcome this in the previous reading? We’ll leave it to you!</p>
<p>Test your final product by entering different sentences at runtime and changing what words are included in the dictionary file. Amazing!</p>
<p><strong>Ask an instructor for a code review.</strong></p>
<h2 id="bonus-pick-a-file-any-file">Bonus: Pick a file, any file</h2>
<p>We recommend completing all other core projects in this lesson before going back and working on this bonus or any other bonus features.</p>
<p>Create a copy of your entire <code>censor-project</code> directory so that you have a working version of the core project to reference. You may find yourself making some drastic changes in this bonus (but hopefully not :)).</p>
<p>In the core phases of this project, we hard-coded the location of the dictionary file to be <code>forbidden-dictionary.txt</code>. Your objective for this bonus is to now allow the user to specify which dictionary file they would like to use after they enter their sentence. For example, let’s say that we added some additional files to our working directory so that it had the following structure:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>/censor-project
├── censor.js
├── forbidden-dictionary.txt
├── bonus-dictionary-a.txt
└── some_deeper_directory
    └── bonus-dictionary-b.txt</code></pre>
<p>We recommend that you mimic the structure above. Feel free to populate the <code>.txt</code> files with whatever words you like (be sure to separate each word with a newline).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how the final product might behave:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node censor.js
Enter a sentence to be censored: what a really strange place to park a car
Enter a path to a dictionary: forbidden-dictionary.txt
what a really str*ng* place to p*rk a car</code></pre>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node censor.js
Enter a sentence to be censored: eat your vegetables
Enter a path to a dictionary: bonus-dictionary-a.txt
eat y**r v*g*t*bl*s</code></pre>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node censor.js
Enter a sentence to be censored: don&#39;t slam the door
Enter a path to a dictionary: ./some_deeper_directory/bonus-dictionary-b.txt
don&#39;t slam the d**r</code></pre>
<p>We’ll leave the rest to you, programmer!</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="global-replace-project">Global Replace Project</h1>
<p>Let’s continue practicing I/O with another quick guided project. In this project, you will be creating a program that will edit a file, replacing all occurrences of a given string with another string. You may be familiar with this “global replace” feature as it is frequently supported by word processors. VSCode also supports this functionality through the <code>cmd/ctrl + f</code> shortcut. Your goal is to implement this feature for yourself using JavaScript and Node’s <code>fs</code> module!</p>
<p>The solution for this project is available at the end of these instructions. Be sure to give it an honest shot before you take a peek!</p>
<h2 id="the-objective-2">The Objective</h2>
<p>Let’s take a bird’s-eye-view of how our final product will behave. Let’s say that we had an <code>essay.txt</code> file that had the following random text:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Lorem ipsum dolor amet single-origin coffee trust fund organic
normcore, wayfarers narwhal fam hashtag ugh VHS af. Try-hard

Taiyaki slow-carb distillery, seitan food truck drinking vinegar
hexagon gastropub offal gluten-free banjo.</code></pre>
<p>For the remainder of these instructions, you may assume that our <strong>original</strong> <code>essay.txt</code> contains the text above, before the program edits it.</p>
<p>When we run our program, <code>global-replace.js</code>, we should be able to specify command line arguments for the file to edit, the target string, and the replacement string. For example, we should be able to use our program to edit <code>essay.txt</code> by replacing every occurrence of <code>'oo'</code> with <code>'HIYAAAH'</code> by executing the following command in our terminal:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>$ node global-replace.js essay.txt oo HIYAAAH</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, the <strong>modified</strong> contents of <code>essay.txt</code> will be:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Lorem ipsum dolor amet single-origin coffee trust fund organic

<p>With this high-level goal in mind, let’s jump in!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> The random text we used above is a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">lorem ipsum</a>. Lorem ipsum is meaningless placeholder text that is commonly used to temporarily fill space. You’ll likely be seeing lorem ipsum text on websites that are in development when actual data isn’t available yet. To generate our essay.txt, we used lorem hipsum.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="phase-1-setup-and-command-line-arguments">Phase 1: Setup and Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>We’ll create this project from scratch. Begin by creating a <code>global-replace-project</code> directory. This will be our working directory for the entirety of this project, so <code>cd</code> into it. Inside of your directory, create two files: <code>global-replace.js</code> and <code>essay.txt</code>. We recommend that you use VSCode to populate the <code>essay.txt</code> file with our original text from above so you can follow our examples. Your directory structure should be:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>/global-replace-project
├── essay.txt
└── global-replace.js</code></pre>
<p>We’ll put <code>essay.txt</code> aside until the second phase.</p>
<h3 id="taking-command-line-arguments">Taking command line arguments</h3>
<p>Let’s work on reading command line arguments when the user executes the program. You may have noticed that the final product output provided in the introduction shows the user specifying arguments along with the command that we classically use to run the program, <code>node global-replace.js</code>. Previously, we’ve been collecting input <em>during runtime</em> with the <code>readline</code> module, but that is not the case here.</p>
<p>Taking command line arguments is very simple in Node and doesn’t require any modules. To do this, we’ll reference the <code>process.argv</code> value that is available when a <code>.js</code> file is executed with Node. See this for yourself by writing this simple line at the top of your <code>global-replace.js</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb85"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">process</span>.<span class="at">argv</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you execute your script with <code>node global-replace.js</code>, you should see an array containing the paths to the Node runtime and your script. Here is what the output looked like on our machine:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>[ &#39;/usr/local/bin/node&#39;,
  &#39;/Users/az/Desktop/global-replace-project/global-replace.js&#39; ]</code></pre>
<p>See where this is heading? If you execute your script with additional arguments separated by spaces, such as <code>node global-replace.js potato.txt tomato squash</code>, the <code>process.argv</code> array will contain those additional arguments:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>[ &#39;/usr/local/bin/node&#39;,
  &#39;/Users/az/app_academy/Module-JavaScript/projects/node/global-replace-project/global-replace-project/global-replace.js&#39;,
  &#39;potato.txt&#39;,
  &#39;tomato&#39;,
  &#39;sqash&#39; ]</code></pre>
<p>We’ll assume that the user will specify the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>, <code>OLD_STR</code>, and <code>NEW_STR</code> arguments in that order. In your script, assign three global <code>const</code> variables to contain these arguments from <code>process.argv</code>. Bragging rights awarded if you do this with <em>array destructuring</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> It is convention in many programming languages to style global constant variables with CONSTANT_CASE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The global <code>process</code> object is specific to Node and is not available in the browser runtime. We use it here for <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv">process.argv</a> and we used it previously for <code>process.stdin</code> and <code>process.stdout</code> when creating interfaces for the readline module in past projects.</p>
<p>One more note before moving on. Depending on how you decide to implement things during this project, your program may require you to enter all three command line arguments in order to execute. That is, you’ll have to execute your code with <code>node global-replace.js arg1 arg2 arg3</code> and not just <code>node global-replace.js</code>.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2-simple-string-replacement-and-file-reading">Phase 2: Simple string replacement and file reading</h2>
<p>For now, we won’t be utilizing the command line arguments. Let’s work on implementing logic to perform global replacement on a string.</p>
<p>In <code>global-replace.js</code>, write a function named <code>replace</code> that accepts three string arguments. The function should return a modified version of the first string where all occurrences of the second string are replaced with the third. Your function should satisfy the following examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb88"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb88-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">replace</span>(<span class="st">&quot;what a great program&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;o&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;whot o greot progrom&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb88-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">replace</span>(<span class="st">&quot;what a great program&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;gr&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;what a deat prodam&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb88-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">replace</span>(<span class="st">&quot;have a nice day&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;a nice&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;an amazing&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &#39;have an amazing day&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the <code>replace</code> function is complete, delete all test calls you made to it. We’ll set this function aside for a moment to focus our attention on performing some file I/O on the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>.</p>
<p>Import the <code>fs</code> module and use the <code>readFile</code> method to read the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>. Look up the documentation if you forgot how to do this. Use ‘utf8’ as the encoding and print any errors that occur during the read. Also simply print out the contents of the file to check if everything is working as it should.</p>
<p>Upon running <code>node global-replace.js essay.txt</code>, you should see the contents of your file printed out. If you do, take things a step further by printing out a modified version of the file contents where all instances of <code>OLD_STR</code> are replaced with <code>NEW_STR</code>. Recall that the data from <code>readFile</code> will be read as one long string since we specified ‘utf8’; this is a perfect fit for our <code>replace</code> function. Do not worry about overwriting the contents of the file yet, simply <code>console.log</code> the modified contents.</p>
<p>Test your work by passing three valid command line arguments. For example here is what our program printed upon running <code>node global-replace.js essay.txt a X</code>:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Lorem ipsum dolor Xmet single-origin coffee trust fund orgXnic

<p>Almost done! Now we just need to take this new string and rewrite the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>.</p>
<h2 id="phase-3">Phase 3:</h2>
<p>Let’s take a quick recap of what we are dealing with before we put the finishing touch on this project. So far, our program <em>asynchronously</em> reads data from the <code>TARGET_FILE</code> and we use <code>replace</code> to modify the incoming data from the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>. In order to write this modified data back into the <code>TARGET_FILE</code>, we need to utilize <em>callback chaining</em> because all of these file operations are asynchronous!</p>
<p>Utilize callback chaining and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback">writeFile</a> to rewrite the <code>TARGET_FILE</code> with the new data. This means you will have to call <code>writeFile</code> within the callback for <code>readFile</code>. Be sure to use ‘utf8’ and print any errors that occur during the write.</p>
<p>Test your final product by running your program a few times, replacing different substrings. Verify that the contents of <code>essay.txt</code> are changed. Test things further by creating your own <code>.txt</code> files to edit! Remember that we can specify any <code>TARGET_FILE</code> through command line arguments, so your program is very dynamic!</p>
<p><strong>Ask an instructor for a code review.</strong></p>
<h2 id="bonus-replacing-the-first-n-occurrences">Bonus: Replacing the first ‘n’ occurrences</h2>
<p>We recommend completing all other core projects in this lesson before going back and working on this bonus or any other bonus features.</p>
<p>For this bonus, we’ll give our program the ability to accept an additional fourth argument representing the number of occurrences to replace. In other words, we should be able to run the program with the following arguments:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>node global-replace.js essay.txt i hello 3</code></pre>
<p>This should edit the <code>essay.txt</code> file, replacing the first 3 occurrences of ‘i’ with ‘hello’. This new argument should be optional, so if we run the program with:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>node global-replace.js essay.txt i hello</code></pre>
<p>It should replace <strong>all</strong> occurrences of ‘i’ with ‘hello’, as it did in the core project.</p>
<p>We’ll leave the implementation up to you! Good luck.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="repo-madness-project-managing-your-code-with-git">Repo Madness Project: Managing Your Code With Git</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve developed an understanding of what Git is and why we use it, let’s get to work! We’re going on a time-traveling adventure with Git as our vehicle.</p>
<p>We’ll review: - Creating and navigating a Git repository, - Adding and changing our files, - Browsing a timeline of our changes, - and rewriting history!</p>
<h2 id="phase-1-laying-the-foundation">Phase 1: Laying the foundation</h2>
<p>To get started, we need to create a timeline. For this project, we’ll be working with plain old JavaScript objects. As we move forward and back in time, we’ll observe changes in our objects.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating our own timeline from scratch. Once we’ve practiced this, we’ll import an already-organized timeline from GitHub and use it as a base for our adventure.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1a-create-your-own-reality">Phase 1a: Create your own reality</h3>
<p>We’ll take control of time and space by creating our own timeline first! Create a new Git repository called “my-custom-timeline”. Within this repository, create a file called <code>me.js</code>. Add an empty JavaScript object to your <code>js</code> file. Finally, add <code>me.js</code> to the staging area of your repo and commit the new file with a commit message of “Initial commit (before I came along)”.</p>
<p>Since this is your timeline, let’s add some important dates in your own life. We’ll start (as we all do!) with your birthday. Inside <code>me.js</code>, add a couple properties to your JavaScript object. Add an <code>"age"</code> property and set it to <code>0</code>, and add at least one more property to describe yourself: maybe <code>"hairColor": "brown"</code>. Add these changes to your repo and commit them with a message like “Add birthday (1987)”. Including the year in your commit messages for this phase will make it easy to follow your timeline in your commit history later on.</p>
<p>Time marches on - and so should you! Think of at least three more significant dates in your life. These could be graduations, vacations, or even the day your cohort started at App Academy! With each event, make appropriate changes to <code>me.js</code>. Update your <code>"age"</code> value and modify the object to reflect what changes you experienced. For example: if one of your significant dates was a wedding, you might add a <code>"spouse"</code> property.</p>
<p>Your repository should end up with at least four commits: one for “Initial commit (before I came along)” and three for events on your timeline. Remember: we’re focusing on Git, so you should use clear commit messages in imperative voice that make it easy to look back over your changes.</p>
<p>Once you’re satisfied, take a look at your Git commit log. It should read like a (very) abridged biography. This is what every repo’s commit history should look like: a concise history of significant changes as the project has evolved.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1b-a-shared-experience">Phase 1b: A shared experience</h3>
<p>Let’s move on to more advanced techniques. For this, we’ll need to ensure we’re all starting with the same timeline. Leave your <code>my-custom-timeline</code> directory and download the skeleton for this project below. After opening the .ZIP file, you should end up with a new directory containing a single file: <code>earth.js</code>. Navigate into this directory using <code>cd my-shared-timeline</code> from your terminal. We’ll build on this shared timeline from here on.</p>
<p>Take a look at <code>earth.js</code>. You’ll see a JavaScript object containing the name of our planet as well as <strong>very</strong> rough population estimates. This object will include all the data we track on our new timeline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick aside: Our “population estimates” are pretty silly, but you should be focused on the “time-traveling” techniques of Git and not the historical authenticity of these examples. If you’d like to know more, we’ve loosely based our original timeline on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life">“Timeline of the evolutionary history of life”</a>. Feel free to draw from this resource for ideas as you customize your own history!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="phase-2-exploring-our-timeline">Phase 2: Exploring our timeline</h2>
<p>What we’re seeing in <code>earth.js</code> is representative of the present. Take a look at your commit history. Notice how our log here reads like a very simplified history of Earth. Let’s travel back and see what we can find!</p>
<h2 id="phase-2a-looking-around-without-moving">Phase 2a: Looking around without moving</h2>
<p>Before we set off, let’s look back over our timeline so we know what we’re getting into. Using <code>git diff</code>, compare your current commit to the first commit in the repository’s history. You should see a single line change: one subtraction, one addition, both on the same line.</p>
<p>Of course, we can tell from the commit history that more has changed than just that one line! <code>git diff</code> is a great tool for seeing the <strong>overall</strong> change since a particular point in time, but to see <strong>all</strong> the changes since that time, we have to look at each commit separately.</p>
<p>Try comparing more commits in the repo. Between which diffs can you see the most changes? Are there any commits with a <em>net neutral</em> (no change) diff between them?</p>
<p>Notice that nothing changes about your current state as you view diffs. Diffing is a safe way of browsing a repo without changing your position, so it’s great as a “quick reference” if you need to check a detail in your repo’s history.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2b-our-first-steps-through-time">Phase 2b: Our first steps through time</h2>
<p>Now, let’s relocate and see each commit with its respective context. Using <code>git checkout</code>, navigate to the first commit in the repository. How many of each population are there at this time?</p>
<p>Let’s jump back to the present! Check out the <code>master</code> ref to return to the latest commit on this branch.</p>
<p>Try stepping through your history one commit at a time and observing how <code>earth.js</code> changes. As you browse through your repo, keep an eye on your <code>git log</code> output as well. Notice that you’re unable to see commits ahead of your current position - only those that were created in the past.</p>
<p>Remember: checking out a commit is non-destructive, so it’s a safe way to explore the state of a repository at a given point in time.</p>
<h2 id="phase-3-changing-history">Phase 3: Changing history</h2>
<p>Checking out and comparing commits are both safe, non-destructive ways of browsing your repo. What if we would rather do some damage and make real changes? It’s time to get messy!</p>
<p>Before we make any changes, we need to ensure we’re not damaging our original timeline. The safest way to make isolated changes to a repo is via a branch. Let’s create a new branch titled <code>alternate-timeline-for-&lt;your-github-username-here&gt;</code>. Use <code>git status</code> to make sure you’ve checked your new branch out before continuing.</p>
<p>Let’s go back a few million years and make a change that will have serious effects on our timeline. Using <code>git reset</code>, travel back to 4.5 million years ago. Let’s assume mankind had never come along to drive the woolly mammoth to extinction. How many mammoths might there be today: 200+? 500+? Even more?</p>
<p>Update <code>earth.js</code> to include your estimate of how many mammoths might roam the Earth today. Add this change to your staging area and commit it with a message like “Today: Mammoths rule the world”.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at your commit history. You should see that the previous two commits for “2.5 million years ago” and “Today” have been totally replaced by your one new commit for “Today”. Congratulations: you’ve changed history! You can use <code>git diff</code> to compare your new branch with the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h2 id="phase-4-choose-your-fate">Phase 4: Choose your fate</h2>
<p>Take a few minutes to play around with your new branch. You can add additional commits and rewrite different parts of history as you see fit. Did the dinosaurs live into modern times, letting you own a cool Tyrannosaurus Rex pet? It’s up to you!</p>
<p>When you’re done, let’s share your new vision with the world. We’ll do this with the help of GitHub.</p>
<p>First, we need to make sure your alternative timeline is compatible with our original timeline. Merge the <code>master</code> branch into your branch and resolve any conflicts. Since we’re only changing numbers, this should be an easy conflict to resolve: just remove the “old” numbers from the <code>master</code> branch, replace them with your “new” population totals, and make sure you don’t leave any merge conflict artifacts (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=====</code>, or <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) hanging around in there! <code>git status</code> will provide some helpful details if you’re unsure how to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you’ve successfully merged <code>master</code> into your branch, we need to go to GitHub and create a new remote for our project.</p>
<p>Go to GitHub and create a new repo under your account called <code>my-shared-timeline</code>. This will serve as our new “remote”. You can give it a description, but do not create a README file. The repository can be public or private.</p>
<p>Once you have created this repo, you need to tell your local git repository to use this Github repo as its remote. Do the following on your local terminal: <code>git checkout master</code> <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/my-shared-timeline.git</code> <code>git push -u origin master</code></p>
<p>A note on HTTPS vs. SSH: For now, you should use HTTPS for cloning and pushing GitHub repos. This will require you to enter your username and password. Eventually, we will have you generate SSH keys which allow you to store a unique key on your local machine that GitHub reads for authentication purposes.</p>
<p>Now that we have our remote repository, we need to push up our new branch and open a pull request. You’ll want <code>master</code> to be the <em>base</em> branch and your branch to be the <em>compare</em> branch. Don’t forget to add a short description of the changes you made. You can review your changes on GitHub before opening the PR.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-3">What We’ve Learned</h2>
<p>Whew! We’re safely back in the present. Git is a powerful tool that lets us explore and manage the history of our repository with ease. While playing with dinosaurs can be fun, you’ve also been flexing your programming muscles by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new code repository from scratch,</li>
<li>Tracking changes to a JavaScript file over time,</li>
<li>Practicing how to explore an unfamiliar repo,</li>
<li>Branching off a shared repo to make your own changes,</li>
<li>and sharing those changes with your team and/or the world via GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are skills you’ll use on the job many times per day, so we’ll continue to get lots of practice together as you incorporate Git in upcoming projects.</p>

<h1 id="navigating-your-filesystem">Navigating Your Filesystem</h1>
<p>Imagine you’re on a trip to a new country. You’re carrying a dictionary, but it’s slow to translate every word you hear and you need to use a map. You would get used to these limitations eventually, but wouldn’t it be great if you spoke a bit of the local language instead?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is likely how you’ve been using computers for most of your life! Modern machines are built to make navigating easy and entertaining, but you’re not “speaking the computer’s language”. That changes today. Let’s explore the terminal!</p>
<p>We’ll discuss: - How to find your way around your files <em>without</em> double-clicking any folders, - Creating &amp; managing new files &amp; directories, - and cleaning up after yourself.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-lay-of-the-land">Getting the lay of the land</h2>
<p>You’ve already used a <em>terminal</em> for some tasks like controlling Git, but let’s dive a little deeper. Your terminal is the interface you use to direct the computer. The word “terminal”, as used here, comes from the early days of modern computing, when a <em>terminal interface</em> (often a screen &amp; keyboard) would be hooked up to an otherwise manually-operated computer. This interface allowed a human to provide instructions to the computer without turning dials or requiring a complex manual to do so. Today, even though our terminal is built into our computer, we still use the term to refer to the application we’re using to input our own instructions!</p>
<p>To keep everything in one place, we’ll use the terminal that’s built into Visual Studio Code. If you haven’t yet, go ahead and open it. You can do so by clicking “View” from the top menu in VS Code, then “Terminal”. You should see a new pane at the bottom of your editor.</p>
<h3 id="parts-of-the-terminal">Parts of the terminal</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/cli-command-line-labeled.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The row in your terminal with a flashing <em>cursor</em> is called the <em>command line</em>. It’s exactly as the name describes: the line upon which we enter our commands. Because we’re using the command line to instruct the computer, we sometimes refer to the terminal as a <em>command line interface</em> or <em>CLI</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The bit of text just before your command line is called the <em>prompt</em>. This will differ for each computer and will usually give you a little context about which directory you’re in. You can customize your prompt to suit your style with custom code.</p></li>
<li><p>We refer to anything that’s already been executed in the terminal as <em>output</em>. You’ll likely see a little output in your terminal even if you haven’t run anything yet. This is due to setup that’s performed each time you begin a new terminal <em>session</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-few-quick-tricks">A few quick tricks</h3>
<p>Here are a few keyboard shortcuts to help you along. Some of these may be review for you. Give them a quick try before moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Return/Enter</code> will submit the command you’ve typed.</li>
<li><code>↑/↓</code> will move up &amp; down in your <em>command history</em>.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl + A</code> will move your cursor to the beginning of the line, while <code>Ctrl + E</code> will move you to the end.</li>
<li>To clear the terminal screen, press <code>Ctrl + L</code>. You can still scroll up to see your previous output if you need to.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-directories">Understanding directories</h3>
<p>Let’s run through a quick review of how your file system is structured. Your computer contains both <em>files</em> and <em>directories</em>. We distinguish these by their content: a file contains text or binary content that we can interact with, and a directory contains both files and other directories!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside: It’s easy to confuse “files” and “folders”, so it’s best to use the term “directory” instead. It’s worth an extra syllable to prevent confusion!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Directories and files form a tree-like structure, where each directory creates a new branch and each file is like a leaf. We can write the <em>path</em> to the file or directory we want by joining all its <em>ancestors</em> with forward slashes, like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb92"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb92-1" title="1">  <span class="ex">/users/app_academy_student/homework/my-homework.txt</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in “tree” form:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/cli-file-system.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>There are a few special short names for particular directories you should know, too.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is your <em>home directory</em>. This is the same as <code>/Users/your_username/</code> on macOS.</li>
<li><code>/</code> is the <em>root directory</em>. This is the highest available directory and contains all the other directories &amp; files in your file system.</li>
<li><code>.</code> is your current directory and <code>..</code> is your current directory’s parent. For example, in <code>/Users/You/</code>, <code>.</code> refers to the <code>You/</code> directory and <code>..</code> refers to the <code>Users/</code> directory</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-around">Getting around</h2>
<p>Now, we’re comfortable on our command line. Let’s start navigating our filesystem directly from our keyboard - no touchpad required!</p>
<h3 id="where-am-i">Where am I?</h3>
<p>When getting started in a new place, it’s often helpful to orient yourself to your surroundings. The easiest way to orient yourself in the terminal is with the <code>pwd</code> command. <code>pwd</code> stands for “Print Working Directory”. It will print the full path to your current directory out to your terminal. Give it a try now!</p>
<p>You might get back something unexpected here. If your prompt includes <code>~</code>, <code>pwd</code> will return <code>/Users/your-user-name/</code> in its place. Remember that <code>pwd</code> always returns the full path where you are, without any special characters or shortcuts.</p>
<p>Once you know where you are, it’s good to see what else is there! We can look at what’s present in the current folder with <code>ls</code>. <code>ls</code> is short for “List”, and will display the contents of whatever path you provide it with. For example, you could run <code>ls .</code> to see your current directory’s contents, or <code>ls ~/Projects</code> to see the contents of the “Projects” directory inside your home directory. When you don’t provide any path, <code>ls</code> defaults to the contents of your current working directory.</p>
<h3 id="a-closer-look-at-our-contents">A closer look at our contents</h3>
<p>By itself, <code>ls</code> is useful but can be a little misleading. Linux &amp; MacOS both support the concept of hidden files. These are files or directories whose names are preceded by a <code>.</code>. We’ve seen this before with the <code>.git</code> directory. Within a Git repository, <code>ls</code> alone won’t display the <code>.git</code> folder at all. We’ll see many more hidden files in upcoming lessons.</p>
<p>Command line instructions allow you to use <em>options</em> to alter their behavior. We set these options with either a single <code>-</code> (for shorthand options of one letter) or a <code>--</code> (for option <em>keywords</em>: whole words or phrases). Here’s an example using short options with <code>ls</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb93"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb93-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">ls</span> -a -l</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The above command runs <code>ls</code>, showing <strong>a</strong>ll files and displaying them in a <strong>l</strong>ist format. This ensures that we see <strong>all</strong> files, including those that are hidden. Viewing contents in a list format can make it a little easier to read, and it will show us some extra info about each file/directory! We’ll dig into what that extra info means in a future lesson.</p>
<p>Here’s one neat trick you’ll see often with command line options: you can combine short options! Instead of typing <code>-a</code> and <code>-l</code> separately, you can run the same command this way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb94"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">ls</span> -al</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Short options like this aren’t order dependent, so <code>ls -la</code> will perform the same action.</p>
<h3 id="navigating-directories">Navigating directories</h3>
<p>Now we know where we are and we know how to see what’s around us. Let’s set off on an adventure! It’s time to navigate to other directories.</p>
<p>We switch to a different directory with the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code>, which stands for “Change Directory”, expects a path just like <code>ls</code>. Running <code>cd</code> with no arguments will assume you’d like to change to your home directory, and you’ll end up back at <code>~</code>.</p>
<p>You can <code>cd</code> from any folder you have permission to access to any other folder on your system. There’s no need to move in small steps! You can jump directly from <code>~</code> to <code>~/Projects/Homework-Week-1/Project-Name/code</code> with a single <code>cd</code> command.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples of common <code>cd</code> commands you’ll use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change to your home directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb95"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-2" title="2"><span class="co"># OR</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> ~</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-4" title="4"><span class="co"># OR</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> /Users/YourUserName</a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Navigate up a single level from your current position:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb96"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb96-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> ..</a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Move back to the last directory you were in:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb97"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb97-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> -</a></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-caveat">A caveat</h3>
<p>You’re browsing through your file system when you hit a snag: you encounter a “Permission denied” error. Oh no!</p>
<p>Have no fear. This is perfectly normal. Your operating system has a strict permissions system that tries its best to keep you from doing accidental damage. This is less obvious when you’re browsing folders with Finder or File Explorer, where dangerous files/directories are hidden from view. In the terminal, though, these unexpected blocks can be jarring.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with “Permission denied”, it’s best to ignore it and go another direction for now. We’ll discuss ways around this once you’ve had more practice in the directories you already have permission to access.</p>
<h2 id="making-changes">Making changes</h2>
<p>You’re a lean, mean, navigating machine! That’s great, but now it’s time to gain more control of your environment. Let’s discuss how to create your own files and folders from the command line.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-files-directories">Creating new files &amp; directories</h3>
<p>You may not have much navigating to do if you’re in an empty home directory. To start, let’s discuss files. The fastest way to create an empty file is with the <code>touch</code> command. You give <code>touch</code> a path &amp; file name, and it creates an empty file at that path with your given name. Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb98"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb98-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">touch</span> myApp.js</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb98-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb98-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">touch</span> ~/.js_settings</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>touch</code> doesn’t put any content in the file, nor does it open the file for editing. This is a great utility for laying your files out, but you’ll quickly want to move to a file editor (like VS Code) to make changes to these files.</p>
<p>For directories, we have the <code>mkdir</code> command. <code>mkdir</code> is short for “Make Directory” and will create a new, empty directory with the name you pass it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb99"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb99-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mkdir</span> my-cool-projects</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb99-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb99-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mkdir</span> ~/new-code</a></code></pre></div>
<p>A common problem when learning <code>mkdir</code> is trying to create <em>nested</em> directories. For example, if I wanted to create a “first-week” directory inside a “homework” directory in my home folder, I would need to ensure the “homework” directory exists first. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb100"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb100-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mkdir</span> ~/homework/first-week</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb100-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb100-3" title="3"><span class="ex">mkdir</span>: ~/homework: No such file or directory</a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can solve this with a commonly-used short option for <code>mkdir</code>: <code>-p</code>. The <code>-p</code> option stands for <strong>parent</strong>, and it will cause <code>mkdir</code> to create <em>all</em> parent directories it needs to create the requested directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb101"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb101-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mkdir</span> -p ~/none/of/these/directories/exist/but/now/they/will</a></code></pre></div>
<p>One last thing: when naming files and directories, do not use spaces! You can make multi-word names more distinct by using underscores, hyphens, and using camelCase. While files are <em>allowed</em> to have spaces in their names, this can complicate navigation. You’ll thank yourself later if you avoid them altogether.</p>
<h3 id="manipulating-existing-files">Manipulating existing files</h3>
<p>You’re browsing directories. You’re making files. Woohoo! Are you ready to make some changes?</p>
<p>Just like using your mouse in Finder, you can copy/relocate files and directories from the terminal. The commands you’ll need are <code>cp</code> and <code>mv</code>.</p>
<p><code>cp</code> is short for “copy” and will create a duplicate of a file. It requires two arguments: a <em>source</em> and a <em>destination</em>. <em>source</em> can be the relative or absolute path of a file, <em>destination</em> can be a path to a file or a directory. If <em>destination</em> is a directory, <code>cp</code> will copy the source file into that directory. If <em>destination</em> is a file path, <code>cp</code> will copy the source file into that new location.</p>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: If a file already exists in the destination of your copy command, <code>cp</code> will overwrite the existing file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-1" title="1"><span class="co"># Will copy the file into the `people` subdirectory.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">cp</span> best-friend.txt people/</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-4" title="4"><span class="co"># This command is identical to the above.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">cp</span> best-friend.txt people/best-friend.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In each of these cases, we’ll create an exact copy of <code>best-friend.txt</code> from your current working directory and place that copy in the <code>people</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can copy directories just like files, but you’ll need a special short options to do so: <code>-r</code>. This option, short for “Recursive”, copies not just the directory but all of its contents! Without it, the directory will fail to copy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb103"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb103-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">ls</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb103-2" title="2"><span class="ex">my_dir</span> my_other_dir</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb103-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb103-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">cp</span> my_dir my_other_dir/</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb103-5" title="5"><span class="ex">cp</span>: -r not specified<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">omitting</span> directory <span class="st">&#39;my_dir/&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, <code>mv</code> “moves” a file from one place to another. Think of this like the “Cut” options on other operating systems. Again, you pass two arguments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb104"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mv</span> breakfast-foods/cereal.txt anytime-foods/cereal.txt</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-3" title="3"><span class="co"># or identically:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb104-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">my</span> breakfast-foods/cereal.txt anytime-foods/</a></code></pre></div>
<p>What if you need to rename a file? There is no <code>rename</code> command in the terminal. Instead, you’ll use <code>mv</code> to accomplish this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb105"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb105-1" title="1"><span class="fu">mv</span> speled-rong.txt spelled-wrong.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> can be used to move or rename directories. However, unlike <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> does <em>not</em> require a flag to do so. This is because the <code>mv</code> operation simply renames the directory, so we’re not concerned about the contents within it.</p>
<h3 id="clean-up-aisle">Clean up: aisle <code>~</code>!</h3>
<p>Okay, file system traveler. You’ve thrown <code>mkdir</code> and <code>touch</code> around for long enough! Let’s discuss how we remove files and directories.</p>
<p>There are two removal commands in your terminal: <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>. The former is for files or directories, while the latter is for directories only. The use cases can be a little confusing, so let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>First, <code>rmdir</code>. This command, short for “Remove Directory” is only for removing an empty directory. If the directory has any files or other directories within it, the command will fail. You’ll use this command occasionally for cleaning up extra directories you’ve created, but you’re more likely to use the other removal command we mentioned.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb106"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb106-1" title="1"><span class="co"># Remember, ~/my-app must be empty for this succeed!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb106-2" title="2"><span class="fu">rmdir</span> ~/my-app</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Last, <code>rm</code>. This command is short for “Remove” and can be one of the most dangerous tools in your arsenal. We’ve mentioned this before, but it bears repeating: <em>never use <code>rm</code> unless you’re absolutely sure of what you’re removing</em>! The terminal is often much less forgiving than the Finder app or Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>To use <code>rm</code>, you provide a filename or path. If you need to remove a directory along with all of its contents, you can use the <code>-r</code> short option, which will “Recursively” remove all files within the directory before removing the directory itself. Your terminal will guide you along this process - all you have to do is type “y” for “Yes” or any other key for “no” as it asks you about each file within the directory you’re deleting. Once a file has been <code>rm</code>’ed, it’s unrecoverable, so be <em>careful</em> about what you use <code>rm</code> on!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb107"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">rm</span> file-we-dont-need.txt</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb107-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">rm</span> -r directory-full-of-files-we-dont-need/</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Try practicing these new tools by cleaning up the mess you’ve made while experimenting. You’ll get lots more practice using these as the days progress.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-4">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>Navigating in the terminal is a little different than we’re used to, but it’s much faster to type commands than to drag a mouse! You should now have a greater mastery of: - Exploring your file system via the terminal, - Creating, updating, and removing files and directories, - Using command line options to enhance our tools with new functionality.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="common-tasks-on-the-command-line">Common Tasks On The Command Line</h1>
<p>Let’s go for a deeper dive into the tools we’ll use day in and day out. We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching for files by content,</li>
<li>Performing multiple commands in sequence,</li>
<li>Terminal text editors &amp; file comparison,</li>
<li>and how to perform common web tasks from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grep-marks-the-spot"><code>grep</code> marks the spot</h2>
<p>One of the most common tasks you’ll have is searching for a particular piece of code in a project. This might be to help diagnose unexpected behavior, or it might just be because you can’t remember exactly where you left off! Either way, having a tool to help you find your way to a specific point in your code is critical to your workflow.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> is a command line utility that was originally created in 1974 and stands out as a well-tested, reliable tool that does one thing well: text search. The name comes from the command sequence <code>g/re/p</code>, meaning “<strong>G</strong>lobally search for a <strong>R</strong>egular <strong>E</strong>xpression and <strong>P</strong>rint” (We’ll discuss <em>regular expressions</em> in a future lesson). You can use <code>grep</code> to find text in a particular file or across multiple files in a particular directory! It’s like using “Cmd + F” from the CLI.</p>
<p>The simplest use of <code>grep</code> is with the contents of a single file. Here’s an example of using it to find all the variables in a JavaScript file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb108"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb108-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> var ./myAppFile.js</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that <code>grep</code> expects at least 2 arguments: a <em>pattern</em> and a <em>source</em> to search. In the above example, <code>var</code> is the pattern and <code>./myAppFile.js</code> is the source. If your search string is more than a single word, you’ll need to wrap it in double-quotes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb109"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb109-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> <span class="st">&quot;I&#39;m a programmer&quot;</span> ./resume.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, <code>grep</code> will return the whole line where your search string appears. This can be a little confusing at first:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/cli-raw-grep-output.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>In this example, there are four lines where the word “remote” appears in the file <code>.git/config</code>. That’s not particularly intuitive from this raw output, though! Let’s look at some ways to provide more helpful info from <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h3 id="common-grep-options">Common <code>grep</code> options</h3>
<p>We’ll occasionally need to modify <code>grep</code>’s default behavior. One common situation is when searching directories. It’s likely that you’ll want to use <code>grep</code> to find any files in a directory that contain a certain pattern. You can do this with the <code>-r</code> option, which stands for “<strong>R</strong>escursive”. When run this way, <code>grep</code> expects a directory path as its source. It will search the directory and all of its children (files and subdirectories). Be aware: if there are lots of files and you’re searching a common phrase, you might get back more than you expect with this option!</p>
<p>Another commonly-used option is <code>-n</code>, for “line <strong>N</strong>umber”. This will show you the exact line for each match. Handy if you want to find something extra-fast!</p>
<p>By default, <code>grep</code> is case-sensitive, so searching for <code>Let</code> won’t bring back instances of <code>let</code>. To override this behavior, use the <code>-i</code> option, for “<strong>I</strong>gnore Case”.</p>
<p>The last common option we’ll discuss is <code>-c</code>, for “<strong>C</strong>ount”. This will return only the number of matches, and not a full list of them. If you use this option in conjunction with <code>-r</code>, you’ll see filenames for each count as well. This will be helpful when trying to track trends in code or when you need to know which directory contains the largest number of matches.</p>
<h2 id="teach-yourself-anything">Teach yourself anything</h2>
<p><code>grep</code>, like most terminal commands, has many more options than we’ve discussed. How can we keep track of them all? Fortunately, we don’t have to! Our system includes the <code>man</code> utility (short for <strong>Man</strong>ual) to help guide us when questions arise.</p>
<p>To learn more about any built-in command, just use <code>man</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb110"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb110-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">man</span> grep</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will open <code>grep</code>’s manual page, the official documentation for the command. You’ll open in a <em>pager</em>, a lightweight document viewer meant to run in your terminal. To browse the <code>man</code> page, use your arrow keys to scroll up &amp; down, and press the “Q” key on your keyboard to <strong>q</strong>uit.</p>
<p><code>man</code> pages contain all the info you need to work with a command line utility. They’re typically structured in a predictable way:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short summary &amp; description of special features at the top,</li>
<li>Command line options with explanations in the middle,</li>
<li>And examples &amp; cool facts (like when the command was created) at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are often terse &amp; technical, but <code>man</code> pages are the official word on the tool you’re curious about and are always a good place to start. Take some time to read through the <code>man</code> pages of some of the commands we’ve already covered!</p>
<h2 id="command-redirection">Command redirection</h2>
<p>With both <code>man</code> and <code>grep</code>, we experienced some serious terminal overload. Wouldn’t it be great if we could send that output somewhere else, like our text editor or a file to read later? We can do this via <em>command redirection</em>.</p>
<p>As the name implies, redirection is all about taking the output from one command and making it the input for a different command. Let’s look at a very simple example using <code>|</code>, the <em>pipe operator</em>, where we’ll combine <code>man</code> and <code>grep</code> to discover how to count pattern matches on a <code>man</code> page:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb111"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb111-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">man</span> grep <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> -C1 count</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that we’re not using the letters “L” or “I” but the vertical pipe character, found on the same key as <code>\</code> and above your “Return” key on US keyboard layouts. This operator takes the output from its left side and passes it to the command on its right as the final argument.</p>
<p>When we run the command above, we’ll get back only the lines from <code>grep</code>’s <code>man</code> page that include the word “count”, along with one line above &amp; below for context:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/cli-grep-redirected-output.png" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>It’s common to want to save output from a command into a file, too! We can do this a few different ways. The easiest is to use the <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operators:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb112"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-1" title="1"><span class="co"># The single &gt; operator will create a new file </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-2" title="2"><span class="co"># to place output in. Existing content will be overwritten.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> -r <span class="st">&quot;TODO&quot;</span> my_app/ <span class="op">&gt;</span> my-app-todos.txt</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-5" title="5"><span class="co"># The double &gt; operator will append your output</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-6" title="6"><span class="co"># to an existing file (or create a new one if needed).</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb112-7" title="7"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> <span class="st">&quot;my-name&quot;</span> list-of-names.html <span class="op">&gt;&gt;</span> name-locations.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>These redirection operators are lightning-quick, but have the caveat of not showing you the output before writing it to the given file! We can use the <code>tee</code> utility to both see our output and have it written to a file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb113"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb113-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">ls</span> my_directory/ <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">tee</span> directory_contents.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Your command line supports its own scripting language and we’re just scratching the surface with these redirection operators. Whenever you find yourself performing one or two simple tasks in the same order numerous times, consider how you might use redirection to simplify that process.</p>
<h2 id="editing-files-directly-from-the-cli">Editing files directly from the CLI</h2>
<p>We can create files from the command line, search for content, and even combine commands into a single line! What about editing files directly from the command line too? Yup - there’s a utility for that!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, there are a <strong>large</strong> number of text editors available for the command line. Two of the most popular ones you’ll hear about are <em>vim</em> and <em>emacs</em>, which can both act as full development environments with a little customization! While you’ll see lots of details about these editors online, it’s best to avoid them for now. We’ll focus on simpler editors with a much smaller learning curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re going to take a look at <code>nano</code>, a terminal text editor that provides easy-to-read instructions and is available on most systems. To get started, just type <code>nano</code> on your command line.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>nano</code> interface:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/cli-nano-diagram.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>The upper part of <code>nano</code> is the editor body. Here you can type just like you would in any other editor. Text and linebreaks will work as expected, but support may be limited for fancy characters or keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen you can see the command menu. These are the actions available to you and the keystrokes you need to access them. Remember that <code>^</code> represents “Ctrl” on your keyboard, so <code>^O</code> is the same as <code>Ctrl + O</code>.</p>
<p>When you attempt to save a file via <code>Ctrl + O</code>, you may be asked to confirm the filename. Type whatever name you’d like your file to have and hit “Enter” to save. Don’t worry: if you’ve forgotten to save recently, <code>nano</code> will help you out by asking if you want to save unsaved changes before exiting!</p>
<p>When you run <code>nano</code> with no arguments, it opens to a new <em>buffer</em>, or empty space in memory ready for you to write. No files will be created until you save them. You can also run <code>nano</code> with a file path as an argument. <code>nano</code> will open the given file for you to edit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb114"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb114-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">nano</span> myApp.js</a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="why-a-terminal-editor">Why a terminal editor?</h3>
<p>While <code>nano</code> is pretty stripped-down compared to a tool like VS Code, there are really great reasons to get familiar with it. The biggest benefits come when working in remote environments.</p>
<p>You’ll sometimes need to log into a server somewhere else in the world and change a configuration file or run an update. If you need to edit text in that remote environment, it’s unlikely you’ll have access to VS Code. It’s dramatically more likely that you’ll have access to <code>nano</code> on your remote terminal. Now you can confidently edit files on computers you may never see in person! How cool is that?</p>
<h2 id="bringing-the-internet-into-your-terminal">Bringing the internet into your terminal</h2>
<p>One last task you’ll perform frequently on the command line is downloading files. This could be anything: an icon pack for your cool new app, an installation script for a larger program, or even a whole webpage to scrape for a project.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>curl</code> command to download from a URL to a file on your computer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb115"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb115-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">curl</span> https://www.my-website.com/my-file.html</a></code></pre></div>
<p>With no other options, <code>curl</code> would download the contents of that URL to a new file titled <code>my-file.html</code> on our system. If you’d rather name the new file yourself, you can use the <code>-o</code> option:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb116"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb116-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">curl</span> -o my-downloaded-file.html https://www.my-website.com/my-file.html</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Like our other CLI utilities, <code>curl</code> is well-known and highly available. There’s an extensive <code>man</code> page that’s worth browsing through, too! <code>curl</code> offers lots of options that let you manage authentication, upload your own files, or even customize the type of request you’re making. It’s a powerful tool behind its rather simple facade.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-5">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>Whew! If this feels like a lot of new tools, don’t worry! They’re all things you’ll use on a daily basis. The beauty of using terminal tools like these is their simplicity: you can build complex workflows out of very simple utilities, and you get lots of practice in the process.</p>
<p>After reading this lesson and exploring on your own, you should be able to: - find specific phrases in files and directories with <code>grep</code>, - learn more about any command using <code>man</code> - link commands together by redirecting output as input, - edit file content using <code>nano</code>, - and download files from the web using <code>curl</code>.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-shell">Understanding The Shell</h1>
<p>As a developer, you’ll spend much of your time working at the command line. Learning the commands you can use is important, but it’s even more important to build a foundational understanding of where those commands go! Let’s get under the hood and discuss the shell.</p>
<p>You’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What a “shell” is,</li>
<li>Shell-specific files and how to customize them,</li>
<li>How commands are executed from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="no-turtles-here">No turtles here!</h2>
<p>We’ve used the word “shell” a few times with no context. Let’s fix that now! A <em>shell</em> in computing terms is the software layer that translates your command line instructions into actual commands. Generally speaking, the shell serves two purposes: <strong>Calling applications using your input</strong> and <strong>supporting user environments/customization</strong>.</p>
<p>The shell is a small part of the much larger <em>operating system</em>, the software that sits between your input and the microchips inside your computer. The operating system, or <em>OS</em>, translates your actions all the way down into machine instructions that can be processed by your CPU. You’ve heard of the most popular OSes out there: Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<h3 id="selling-c-shells-by-the-seashore">Selling C shells by the seashore</h3>
<p>Like most things in web development, many people have strong opinions about which shell is best. There are many shells available that you can install &amp; use, each with its own idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>In our lessons, we’ll focus on two shells, the <em>Bash</em> shell and <em>Zsh</em>. Bash has been around for a little over 30 years and has been battle-tested on the most popular operating systems on the web. The biggest Linux operating systems all use it as the default shell, and macOS has used it as the default until switching to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050">Zsh in macoS Catalina</a>.</p>
<p>Zsh is now the default shell in macOS Catalina and has been in use since the 1990s and has a strong following amongst linux users.</p>
<p>You’ll want to keep which shell you use in mind as you search for help with command line problems, as an answer intended for one shell may not work with your shell.</p>
<p>One nice thing about Zsh is it’s scripting compatibility with Bash. Which means a shell script written for Bash will work in Zsh, although the opposite is not always true.</p>
<h3 id="shells-vs-terminals">Shells vs Terminals</h3>
<p>Your operating system may have an application called a “Terminal”. It’s good to note that a terminal is not a shell and a shell is not a terminal. Terminal applications are really emulating a piece of hardware known as a <em>terminal</em> which nobody really uses anymore.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/DEC_VT100_terminal_transparent.png/675px-DEC_VT100_terminal_transparent.png" alt="Terminal" /><figcaption>Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So we emulate a terminal using an application on our computers. The Terminal application will then execute the shell and it will give us a prompt so we can then type commands.</p>
<h3 id="shell-prompts">Shell Prompts</h3>
<p>You’ll notice your shell prompts you to type something by putting either a <code>$</code> or a <code>%</code> before the cursor. Bash uses <code>$</code> by default while Zsh uses a <code>%</code>. But there’s one more character you may see as your prompt character and that is <code>#</code>. This appears if you are logged in as <code>root</code>, the unix superuser. Since with great power comes great responsibility, whenever we see the <code>#</code> prompt we want to be careful what we type because we could delete system files or cause files to have the wrong permissions if we aren’t absolutely sure what we are doing.</p>
<h3 id="two-purposes">Two purposes</h3>
<p>A shell’s primary purpose is to interpret your commands. It does this by looking for applications installed on your computer and sharing any arguments or environment-specific data they need. Let’s think about the following command, which will print the word “Test” to your terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb117"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb117-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">echo</span> Test</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this command, <code>echo</code> refers to a program called “echo”, while <code>Test</code> is an argument you’ve given the program. Bash doesn’t know what <code>echo</code> does, only that it needs to find an application with that name and give it the word “Test”. The shell trusts the application will handle this input appropriately.</p>
<p>Bash searches for applications using the <code>PATH</code> variable. <code>PATH</code> is a special variable that’s available system-wide and includes all the directories you might store applications in. You can view your own <code>PATH</code> using that <code>echo</code> utility:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb118"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb118-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="va">$PATH</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You should see a list of directory paths separated by colons. When you run a command, your shell extracts the application name from the command and starts going through the <code>PATH</code>, directory by directory, looking for that name. Once it finds it, it passes along your input (or just starts the application, if there’s no input available), and stops looking.</p>
<p>Note that we didn’t just write <code>echo PATH</code> above. Instead, we included a <code>$</code> before the name of the variable. That’s not a typo! On the command line, <code>$</code> before a word indicates that we’re looking for a variable with the following name. Executing the command <code>echo PATH</code> would simply print out the word “PATH”.</p>
<p>You might see a risk from this process right away: what happens if we have two different versions of the same program? Bash will call whichever version of the program it finds first in your <code>PATH</code>! If you’re unsure which version of an application Bash is going to run, you can use the <code>which</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb119"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb119-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">which</span> echo</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb119-2" title="2"><span class="ex">/bin/echo</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This output means Bash is going to run the application found at <code>/bin/echo</code> every time you enter a command beginning with “echo”. If <code>which</code> returns a different version than you’d like to be running, you’ll need to modify your <code>PATH</code>, which we’ll discuss as part of our customization options.</p>
<p>Speaking of customizations: that’s the shell’s secondary purpose! Your shell makes things uniquely yours in a few different ways. The first is <em>environment variables</em>. These are variables that are stored in memory and made available to running applications by the shell. <code>PATH</code> is an example of an environment variable. Another is <code>HOME</code>, which stores the location of your home directory. You can see all your environment variables with the <code>env</code> command, but be prepared to scroll! The list can get pretty long.</p>
<p>Other customizations include scripts, command aliases, and your prompt. We’ll discuss these more as we dig into deeper customization options in this and future lessons.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-command-line-to-the-screen">From the command line to the screen</h3>
<p>It can be helpful to have a high-level overview of what’s happening after you press “Enter” on the command line. Check out the diagram below to see how your command goes from keyboard to the monitor.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-shell-breakdown-hc.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>There are lots of extra steps we’re overlooking here, but this should help you visualize the role of the shell.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-your-environment">Customizing your environment</h2>
<p>Your shell’s defaults (which may differ from system to system) are likely not doing a lot to help you. They’re meant to get things up and going quickly, but you’ll want to expand on them to suit your own tastes! Let’s talk about how to make changes to your shell.</p>
<h3 id="startup-files">Startup files</h3>
<p>The easiest way to make changes to the shell is directly from the command line. For instance, you can use the <code>export</code> command to change/initialize a new environment variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb120"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb120-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">NEW_VARIABLE=</span>value</a></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if you close your current terminal or open a new one, your environment variable will no longer be present! To persist environment variables and other customization settings, you’ll need to put them in a file.</p>
<p>Bash supports several files intended for you to customize: <code>.profile</code>, <code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>Zsh supports several customization files as well, but we will only need to use <code>.zshrc</code> for most setups.</p>
<p>Each of these customization files are found in your home directory and are hidden (as indicated by the <code>.</code> at the beginning of filename).</p>
<p>These customization files are sometimes referred to as <em>dotfiles</em>.</p>
<p>These startup files are executed automatically at different times when you start your shell.</p>
<h3 id="bash-startup-files">Bash startup files</h3>
<p>The <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.profile</code> are executed when bash is started with a <code>-l</code> or <code>--login</code> command line flag. This is called a <em>login shell</em>. If you run bash without this commmand line flag it instead is a <em>non-login shell</em> and runs the <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>
<p>To add a little complexity, Bash will run the <code>.profile</code> only if there isn’t a <code>bash_profile</code>.</p>
<p>Now to confuse matters even more, often the <code>.bash_profile</code> will have a snippet of code in it that executes the <code>.bashrc</code> as well (this is the default on Ubuntu for instance)</p>
<p>To read more about which files Bash runs at which times at this link: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html</p>
<h3 id="zsh-startup-files">Zsh startup files</h3>
<p>The <code>.zshrc</code> file is started anytime you start Zsh for both <em>login shells</em> and <em>non-login</em> shells. It does have a <code>.zlogin</code> file which is only executed on login shells but since <code>.zshrc</code> loads on both most Zsh users don’t use <code>.zlogin</code> and instead put all their customizations in <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<p>To read more about all Zsh’s various startup files you can follow this link: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html</p>
<h2 id="to-login-or-not-to-login">To Login or Not to Login</h2>
<p>So how can you tell if you have a login shell or a non-login shell? It depends on how your operating system works.</p>
<h3 id="macos">macOS</h3>
<p>On macOS prior to Catalina if you open the Terminal application, it runs Bash as a <em>login shell</em> and therefore runs the <code>.bash_profile</code> on every terminal window you open.</p>
<p>After macOS Catalina, if you open the Terminal application it launches Zsh as a <em>login shell</em> and therefore runs both <code>.zlogin</code> and <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-using-wsl">Windows using WSL</h3>
<p>On Windows using WSL, the Windows Ubuntu terminal app runs every bash as a <em>login-shell</em> and therefore will run the <code>.profile</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ubuntu-linux">Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu Linux, by default the <code>.profile</code> is executed when you login to the Ubuntu Desktop. Ubuntu does not include <code>.bash_profile</code> by default. Then when you open the Terminal application, it runs each bash as a <em>non-login shell</em> which only runs <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>This can be somewhat frustrating to have to logout of the Ubuntu Desktop and login back in each time you change your startup file. So instead you can change the Terminal application to run each shell as a login shell by checking this checkbox in the Terminal preferences that reads <em>“Run command as a login shell”</em></p>

</figure>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>When you use Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal, on macOS it defaults to being a login shell, while on Linux and Windows it does not.</p>
<p>You can change the integrated shell in vscode on Ubuntu and Windows using WSL by modifying or adding these settings in the VSCode <code>settings.json</code> file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb121"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb121-1" title="1">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shell.linux&quot;:</span> <span class="er">&quot;bash&quot;,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb121-2" title="2">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux&quot;:</span> <span class="ot">[</span> <span class="st">&quot;-l&quot;</span> <span class="ot">]</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you use macOS Catalina, VSCode will still default to bash in it’s integrated shell, so you can set it to use Zsh like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb122"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb122-1" title="1">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shell.osx&quot;:</span> <span class="er">&quot;zsh&quot;,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb122-2" title="2">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shellArgs.osx&quot;:</span> <span class="ot">[</span> <span class="st">&quot;-l&quot;</span> <span class="ot">]</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="whew-this-seems-complicated-can-you-just-tell-me-which-file-to-use">Whew this seems complicated, can you just tell me which file to use?</h3>
<p>Sure, here’s our recommendations on how to customize your system depending on platform to have the best results.</p>
<h4 id="macos-catalina-with-zsh">macOS Catalina with Zsh</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customizations into your <code>.zshrc</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code to use <code>zsh</code> as it’s shell.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macos-pre-catalina-with-bash">macOS pre-Catalina with Bash</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customizations into your <code>.bash_profile</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ubuntu-linux-1">Ubuntu Linux</h4>
<ul>
<li>Change your terminal to open login shells</li>
<li>Put your customization into your <code>.profile</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal to launch login shells as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="windows-with-wsl">Windows with WSL</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customization into your <code>.profile</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal to launch login shells as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customization-options">Customization options</h3>
<p>Whew, that’s a lot of new jargon &amp; theory! Let’s look at some practical examples of what you can do with your dotfiles in Bash or Zsh.</p>
<p>Adding new options to your dotfiles starts with editing them.</p>
<p>You can open them directly from the command line using VS Code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb123"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-1" title="1">$ <span class="ex">code</span> ~/.bash_profile</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-2" title="2"><span class="co"># OR</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-3" title="3">$ <span class="ex">code</span> ~/.bashrc</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-4" title="4"><span class="co"># OR for Zsh</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb123-5" title="5"><span class="ex">%</span> code ~/.zshrc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you’ve saved your changes, you’ll need to load any updated files into your shell. You can do ths with the <code>source</code> command. <code>source</code> will execute the file it’s given, updating your currently-running environment with any changes you’ve made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb124"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb124-1" title="1"><span class="co"># For Bash</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb124-2" title="2">$ <span class="bu">source</span> ~/.bash_profile</a></code></pre></div>
<p>OR</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb125"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb125-1" title="1"><span class="co"># For Zsh</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb125-2" title="2"><span class="ex">%</span> source ~/.zshrc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>One of the most common customizations are environment variables. These should always be capitalized &amp; use underscores instead of spaces to delineate words. Here are a couple examples of code customizing environment variables, along with comments explaining how each works.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb126"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-1" title="1"><span class="co"># The simplest option: adding a totally new environment variable.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-2" title="2"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">FAVORITE_COLOR=</span>blue</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-4" title="4"><span class="co"># Let&#39;s overwrite an existing environment variable with our own.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-5" title="5"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">HOME=</span>/User/Student/Home</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-7" title="7"><span class="co"># Time to get get more creative: what if we want to _prepend_ </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-8" title="8"><span class="co"># to the PATH variable, instead of overwriting it if it exists?</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb126-9" title="9"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PATH=</span>/User/Student/Applications:<span class="va">$PATH</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In that last example, notice how we used <code>$</code> before <code>PATH</code>. The dollar sign indicates that we’re referencing a variable. Bash will replace <code>$PATH</code> with the value of the <code>PATH</code> variable, so we’re effectively adding our own directory to the beginning of the <code>PATH</code> variable. You’ll see this technique used a <strong>lot</strong> in dotfiles.</p>
<p>Another common customization is aliasing. An <em>alias</em> is a shorthand way of running a command. You might alias because a command is very long to type, or to modify the system’s default behavior! Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb127"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-1" title="1"><span class="co"># Here&#39;s a Git alias that will save you a few keystrokes.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-2" title="2"><span class="bu">alias</span> gst=<span class="st">&quot;git status&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-4" title="4"><span class="co"># Some more Git magic: show the short log with an even shorter command!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-5" title="5"><span class="bu">alias</span> glog=<span class="st">&quot;git log --oneline&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-7" title="7"><span class="co"># By default, &#39;rm&#39; will remove the file you pass it. The &#39;-i&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-8" title="8"><span class="co"># option makes &#39;rm&#39; ask you &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before removing the</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-9" title="9"><span class="co"># given file. This is a great safety net to have while you&#39;re learning!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-10" title="10"><span class="bu">alias</span> rm=<span class="st">&quot;rm -i&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Don’t forget to <code>source</code> your dotfiles if you’re following along!</p>
<p>Entering an alias on the command line makes the aliased command act just like the full command was entered. You can still pass arguments like you normally would! Here are some “before &amp; after” examples of our aliases in action:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-gst.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>Notice how we get the same output from <code>gst</code> as <code>git status</code> with significantly less typing.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-glog.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>Our <code>glog</code> alias provides us with a short, quick-to-read commit history that takes even fewer characters typed than the default <code>git log</code>!</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-rm.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>The <code>rm</code> alias is an example of changing the default behavior of a command. Before we aliased <code>rm</code>, removing a file happened with no confirmation at all. After the alias is applied, we see a prompt that lets us respond “y” (for “<strong>y</strong>es”) or “n” (for “<strong>n</strong>o”). Think of this as the command line version of a “Confirm” or “Cancel” pop-up window!</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-6">What we’ve learned</h2>

</figure>
<p>So we emulate a terminal using an application on our computers. The Terminal application will then execute the shell and it will give us a prompt so we can then type commands.</p>
<h3 id="shell-prompts-1">Shell Prompts</h3>
<p>You’ll notice your shell prompts you to type something by putting either a <code>$</code> or a <code>%</code> before the cursor. Bash uses <code>$</code> by default while Zsh uses a <code>%</code>. But there’s one more character you may see as your prompt character and that is <code>#</code>. This appears if you are logged in as <code>root</code>, the unix superuser. Since with great power comes great responsibility, whenever we see the <code>#</code> prompt we want to be careful what we type because we could delete system files or cause files to have the wrong permissions if we aren’t absolutely sure what we are doing.</p>
<h3 id="two-purposes-1">Two purposes</h3>
<p>A shell’s primary purpose is to interpret your commands. It does this by looking for applications installed on your computer and sharing any arguments or environment-specific data they need. Let’s think about the following command, which will print the word “Test” to your terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb128"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">echo</span> Test</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this command, <code>echo</code> refers to a program called “echo”, while <code>Test</code> is an argument you’ve given the program. Bash doesn’t know what <code>echo</code> does, only that it needs to find an application with that name and give it the word “Test”. The shell trusts the application will handle this input appropriately.</p>
<p>Bash searches for applications using the <code>PATH</code> variable. <code>PATH</code> is a special variable that’s available system-wide and includes all the directories you might store applications in. You can view your own <code>PATH</code> using that <code>echo</code> utility:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb129"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="va">$PATH</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You should see a list of directory paths separated by colons. When you run a command, your shell extracts the application name from the command and starts going through the <code>PATH</code>, directory by directory, looking for that name. Once it finds it, it passes along your input (or just starts the application, if there’s no input available), and stops looking.</p>
<p>Note that we didn’t just write <code>echo PATH</code> above. Instead, we included a <code>$</code> before the name of the variable. That’s not a typo! On the command line, <code>$</code> before a word indicates that we’re looking for a variable with the following name. Executing the command <code>echo PATH</code> would simply print out the word “PATH”.</p>
<p>You might see a risk from this process right away: what happens if we have two different versions of the same program? Bash will call whichever version of the program it finds first in your <code>PATH</code>! If you’re unsure which version of an application Bash is going to run, you can use the <code>which</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb130"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb130-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">which</span> echo</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb130-2" title="2"><span class="ex">/bin/echo</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This output means Bash is going to run the application found at <code>/bin/echo</code> every time you enter a command beginning with “echo”. If <code>which</code> returns a different version than you’d like to be running, you’ll need to modify your <code>PATH</code>, which we’ll discuss as part of our customization options.</p>
<p>Speaking of customizations: that’s the shell’s secondary purpose! Your shell makes things uniquely yours in a few different ways. The first is <em>environment variables</em>. These are variables that are stored in memory and made available to running applications by the shell. <code>PATH</code> is an example of an environment variable. Another is <code>HOME</code>, which stores the location of your home directory. You can see all your environment variables with the <code>env</code> command, but be prepared to scroll! The list can get pretty long.</p>
<p>Other customizations include scripts, command aliases, and your prompt. We’ll discuss these more as we dig into deeper customization options in this and future lessons.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-command-line-to-the-screen-1">From the command line to the screen</h3>
<p>It can be helpful to have a high-level overview of what’s happening after you press “Enter” on the command line. Check out the diagram below to see how your command goes from keyboard to the monitor.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>There are lots of extra steps we’re overlooking here, but this should help you visualize the role of the shell.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-your-environment-1">Customizing your environment</h2>
<p>Your shell’s defaults (which may differ from system to system) are likely not doing a lot to help you. They’re meant to get things up and going quickly, but you’ll want to expand on them to suit your own tastes! Let’s talk about how to make changes to your shell.</p>
<h3 id="startup-files-1">Startup files</h3>
<p>The easiest way to make changes to the shell is directly from the command line. For instance, you can use the <code>export</code> command to change/initialize a new environment variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb131"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb131-1" title="1">$ <span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">NEW_VARIABLE=</span>value</a></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if you close your current terminal or open a new one, your environment variable will no longer be present! To persist environment variables and other customization settings, you’ll need to put them in a file.</p>
<p>Bash supports several files intended for you to customize: <code>.profile</code>, <code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>Zsh supports several customization files as well, but we will only need to use <code>.zshrc</code> for most setups.</p>
<p>Each of these customization files are found in your home directory and are hidden (as indicated by the <code>.</code> at the beginning of filename).</p>
<p>These customization files are sometimes referred to as <em>dotfiles</em>.</p>
<p>These startup files are executed automatically at different times when you start your shell.</p>
<h3 id="bash-startup-files-1">Bash startup files</h3>
<p>The <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.profile</code> are executed when bash is started with a <code>-l</code> or <code>--login</code> command line flag. This is called a <em>login shell</em>. If you run bash without this commmand line flag it instead is a <em>non-login shell</em> and runs the <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>
<p>To add a little complexity, Bash will run the <code>.profile</code> only if there isn’t a <code>bash_profile</code>.</p>
<p>Now to confuse matters even more, often the <code>.bash_profile</code> will have a snippet of code in it that executes the <code>.bashrc</code> as well (this is the default on Ubuntu for instance)</p>
<p>To read more about which files Bash runs at which times at this link: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html</p>
<h3 id="zsh-startup-files-1">Zsh startup files</h3>
<p>The <code>.zshrc</code> file is started anytime you start Zsh for both <em>login shells</em> and <em>non-login</em> shells. It does have a <code>.zlogin</code> file which is only executed on login shells but since <code>.zshrc</code> loads on both most Zsh users don’t use <code>.zlogin</code> and instead put all their customizations in <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<p>To read more about all Zsh’s various startup files you can follow this link: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html</p>
<h2 id="to-login-or-not-to-login-1">To Login or Not to Login</h2>
<p>So how can you tell if you have a login shell or a non-login shell? It depends on how your operating system works.</p>
<h3 id="macos-1">macOS</h3>
<p>On macOS prior to Catalina if you open the Terminal application, it runs Bash as a <em>login shell</em> and therefore runs the <code>.bash_profile</code> on every terminal window you open.</p>
<p>After macOS Catalina, if you open the Terminal application it launches Zsh as a <em>login shell</em> and therefore runs both <code>.zlogin</code> and <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-using-wsl-1">Windows using WSL</h3>
<p>On Windows using WSL, the Windows Ubuntu terminal app runs every bash as a <em>login-shell</em> and therefore will run the <code>.profile</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ubuntu-linux-2">Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu Linux, by default the <code>.profile</code> is executed when you login to the Ubuntu Desktop. Ubuntu does not include <code>.bash_profile</code> by default. Then when you open the Terminal application, it runs each bash as a <em>non-login shell</em> which only runs <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>This can be somewhat frustrating to have to logout of the Ubuntu Desktop and login back in each time you change your startup file. So instead you can change the Terminal application to run each shell as a login shell by checking this checkbox in the Terminal preferences that reads <em>“Run command as a login shell”</em></p>

</figure>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code-1">Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>When you use Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal, on macOS it defaults to being a login shell, while on Linux and Windows it does not.</p>
<p>You can change the integrated shell in vscode on Ubuntu and Windows using WSL by modifying or adding these settings in the VSCode <code>settings.json</code> file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb132"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb132-1" title="1">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shell.linux&quot;:</span> <span class="er">&quot;bash&quot;,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb132-2" title="2">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux&quot;:</span> <span class="ot">[</span> <span class="st">&quot;-l&quot;</span> <span class="ot">]</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you use macOS Catalina, VSCode will still default to bash in it’s integrated shell, so you can set it to use Zsh like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb133"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb133-1" title="1">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shell.osx&quot;:</span> <span class="er">&quot;zsh&quot;,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb133-2" title="2">  <span class="er">&quot;terminal.integrated.shellArgs.osx&quot;:</span> <span class="ot">[</span> <span class="st">&quot;-l&quot;</span> <span class="ot">]</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="whew-this-seems-complicated-can-you-just-tell-me-which-file-to-use-1">Whew this seems complicated, can you just tell me which file to use?</h3>
<p>Sure, here’s our recommendations on how to customize your system depending on platform to have the best results.</p>
<h4 id="macos-catalina-with-zsh-1">macOS Catalina with Zsh</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customizations into your <code>.zshrc</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code to use <code>zsh</code> as it’s shell.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macos-pre-catalina-with-bash-1">macOS pre-Catalina with Bash</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customizations into your <code>.bash_profile</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ubuntu-linux-3">Ubuntu Linux</h4>
<ul>
<li>Change your terminal to open login shells</li>
<li>Put your customization into your <code>.profile</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal to launch login shells as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="windows-with-wsl-1">Windows with WSL</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put your customization into your <code>.profile</code> file.</li>
<li>Change Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal to launch login shells as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customization-options-1">Customization options</h3>
<p>Whew, that’s a lot of new jargon &amp; theory! Let’s look at some practical examples of what you can do with your dotfiles in Bash or Zsh.</p>
<p>Adding new options to your dotfiles starts with editing them.</p>
<p>You can open them directly from the command line using VS Code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb134"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-1" title="1">$ <span class="ex">code</span> ~/.bash_profile</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-2" title="2"><span class="co"># OR</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-3" title="3">$ <span class="ex">code</span> ~/.bashrc</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-4" title="4"><span class="co"># OR for Zsh</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb134-5" title="5"><span class="ex">%</span> code ~/.zshrc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you’ve saved your changes, you’ll need to load any updated files into your shell. You can do ths with the <code>source</code> command. <code>source</code> will execute the file it’s given, updating your currently-running environment with any changes you’ve made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb135"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb135-1" title="1"><span class="co"># For Bash</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb135-2" title="2">$ <span class="bu">source</span> ~/.bash_profile</a></code></pre></div>
<p>OR</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb136"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb136-1" title="1"><span class="co"># For Zsh</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb136-2" title="2"><span class="ex">%</span> source ~/.zshrc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>One of the most common customizations are environment variables. These should always be capitalized &amp; use underscores instead of spaces to delineate words. Here are a couple examples of code customizing environment variables, along with comments explaining how each works.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb137"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-1" title="1"><span class="co"># The simplest option: adding a totally new environment variable.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-2" title="2"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">FAVORITE_COLOR=</span>blue</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-4" title="4"><span class="co"># Let&#39;s overwrite an existing environment variable with our own.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-5" title="5"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">HOME=</span>/User/Student/Home</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-7" title="7"><span class="co"># Time to get get more creative: what if we want to _prepend_ </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-8" title="8"><span class="co"># to the PATH variable, instead of overwriting it if it exists?</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb137-9" title="9"><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PATH=</span>/User/Student/Applications:<span class="va">$PATH</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In that last example, notice how we used <code>$</code> before <code>PATH</code>. The dollar sign indicates that we’re referencing a variable. Bash will replace <code>$PATH</code> with the value of the <code>PATH</code> variable, so we’re effectively adding our own directory to the beginning of the <code>PATH</code> variable. You’ll see this technique used a <strong>lot</strong> in dotfiles.</p>
<p>Another common customization is aliasing. An <em>alias</em> is a shorthand way of running a command. You might alias because a command is very long to type, or to modify the system’s default behavior! Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb138"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-1" title="1"><span class="co"># Here&#39;s a Git alias that will save you a few keystrokes.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-2" title="2"><span class="bu">alias</span> gst=<span class="st">&quot;git status&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-4" title="4"><span class="co"># Some more Git magic: show the short log with an even shorter command!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-5" title="5"><span class="bu">alias</span> glog=<span class="st">&quot;git log --oneline&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-7" title="7"><span class="co"># By default, &#39;rm&#39; will remove the file you pass it. The &#39;-i&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-8" title="8"><span class="co"># option makes &#39;rm&#39; ask you &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before removing the</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-9" title="9"><span class="co"># given file. This is a great safety net to have while you&#39;re learning!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb138-10" title="10"><span class="bu">alias</span> rm=<span class="st">&quot;rm -i&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Don’t forget to <code>source</code> your dotfiles if you’re following along!</p>
<p>Entering an alias on the command line makes the aliased command act just like the full command was entered. You can still pass arguments like you normally would! Here are some “before &amp; after” examples of our aliases in action:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-gst.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>Notice how we get the same output from <code>gst</code> as <code>git status</code> with significantly less typing.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-glog.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>Our <code>glog</code> alias provides us with a short, quick-to-read commit history that takes even fewer characters typed than the default <code>git log</code>!</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-aliases-rm.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>The <code>rm</code> alias is an example of changing the default behavior of a command. Before we aliased <code>rm</code>, removing a file happened with no confirmation at all. After the alias is applied, we see a prompt that lets us respond “y” (for “<strong>y</strong>es”) or “n” (for “<strong>n</strong>o”). Think of this as the command line version of a “Confirm” or “Cancel” pop-up window!</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-7">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>We’re diving deeper behind the scenes of our terminal &amp; operating system, and hopefully you’re beginning to understand how things work together! You should now be comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>What a “shell” is in computer terms,</li>
<li>explaining, at a very high level, how your computer interprets your commands,</li>
<li>reading and redefining the <code>PATH</code> environment variable,</li>
<li>and customizing your system via <em>dotfiles</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="bash-permissions-scripting">Bash Permissions &amp; Scripting</h1>
<p>Now that you’re familiar with Bash, let’s get back to what we’re all here for: PROGRAMMING! We’ll discuss the basics of Bash scripting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new script file,</li>
<li>Accepting user input and conditionally responding to it,</li>
<li>Modifying permissions to make the script executable,</li>
<li>and choosing how to execute your script (or any other application).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-sudo-and-file-permissions">Understanding <code>sudo</code> and file permissions</h2>
<p>Before we can write any code, we need to get a quick look at file permissions in UNIX-based operating systems. Without understanding this critical part of file management, you’ll have a difficult time creating new scripts of your own.</p>
<p>Remember the command/option combo <code>ls -al</code>? We’ll focus in particular on the <code>-l</code> command line option, which <strong>l</strong>ists the files in the directory along with their metadata. This includes their <em>file permissions</em> (also sometimes referred to as <em>modes</em>). Permissions determine who can access a given file or directory.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what a directory and file look like via <code>ls -al</code>:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-ls-list-example.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>The file permissions are the ten characters on the left side of each line. Let’s break them down:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Unix/cli/assets/cli-unix-permissions.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>The leftmost position is the <em>directory indicator</em>. This is the easiest part to read! You’ll see a <code>d</code> for directories and a <code>-</code> for files.</p>
<p>The remaining nine characters are broken into groups of three, representing the <em>owner</em>, <em>group</em>, and <em>others</em> from left to right. Each group has three permissions available:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>read (r)</em>: view a file or directory’s contents</li>
<li><em>write (w)</em>: modify a file or directory’s contents</li>
<li><em>execute (x)</em>: run a file like an application, navigate into a directory</li>
</ul>
<p>A letter in any position means that permission is <em>granted</em>, while a <code>-</code> means the permission is <em>restricted</em>.</p>
<p>In our example above, we can see that the owner (<code>jdh</code>) of the file <code>my-shared-timeline.zip</code> can view the file or edit it, but the group (<code>staff</code>) and world (everyone else) can only view it. No one is allowed to execute the file, but that makes sense in this case: <code>x</code> permissions are mostly used by scripts/applications and directories.</p>
<h3 id="numeric-permission-notation">Numeric permission notation</h3>
<p>While the letters <code>r</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>x</code> are easy to read, you’ll also see a numeric notation for file permissions. To convert letter notation to numeric, you’ll need to grant each permission a number value. <code>x</code> is worth 1, <code>w</code> is worth 2, and <code>r</code> is worth 4. Now, tally up points for each group and write them out side by side.</p>
<p>From our example above, we’d get <code>644</code>. This is the numeric notation for the permissions of <code>my-shared-timeline.zip</code>. You’ll sometimes see these numeric formats referenced in documentation or Bash error messages, so it’s good to know how to read them even if you don’t use them often!</p>
<p>Numeric permissions are presented in <em>octal notation</em>. You can read a few more details about how this works on <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">LinuxCommand.org</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-permissions">Modifying permissions</h3>
<p>We’re not stuck with the permissions a file starts with! We can use the <code>chmod</code> command to update the permissions of a file ourselves. <code>chmod</code>, short for “<strong>ch</strong>ange <strong>mod</strong>e”, dates back to the early days of UNIX. You may hear it pronounced as “cha-mod”, “see-aych-mod”, or even referred to as “change mod”.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’ve written a cool “How To” guide that we’d like to share with all users of our system. Assume we’re starting with permissions where the owner can read or update the file but no one else can even read it (<code>-rw-------</code> or <code>600</code>).</p>
<p>To change this so that anyone on the system can read it, we could run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb139"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb139-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">chmod</span> +r my-guide.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is saying "Add the ‘r’ permission for all users who try to access <code>my-guide.txt</code>.</p>
<p>To <em>revoke</em> that permission, you can exchange <code>+</code> for <code>-</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb140"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb140-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">chmod</span> -r my-guide.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Uh oh! If we check <code>my-guide</code> now, we’ll see that we’re not back at <code>-rw-------</code> - we’re now at <code>--w------</code>! When you change permissions using letter notation and don’t specify a target group, the change affects <strong>all three</strong> groups at once. You can scope this down by preceding the operator with either <code>u</code> (for <strong>user</strong>, meaning the file’s owner), <code>g</code> (for the file’s owning <strong>group</strong>), and <code>o</code> (for <strong>others</strong>).</p>
<p>Let’s add read permissions back for the owner:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb141"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb141-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">chmod</span> u+r my-guide.txt</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Perfect! Now we’ve reverted our permissions back to their original state.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-permissions-entirely-with-sudo">Ignoring permissions entirely with sudo</h3>
<p>Most systems include a <em>root</em> user that has total authority. The root user can run applications and change files indiscriminately. With that much power, it’s hard to keep a system safe! For this reason, it’s a bad practice to log in as <code>root</code>.</p>
<p>To keep us from having to memorize both our own password and that of the <code>root</code> account for every system, we’ve got a helpful command called <code>sudo</code>. <code>sudo</code> is short for “<strong>S</strong>uper <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>Do</strong>”, and as the name implies it allows you to impersonate the <code>root</code> user for a particular task.</p>
<p><strong><code>sudo</code> is inherently dangerous.</strong> Every time you use it, you’re at risk of doing real damage to the system you’re on. While there are some <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/sudo_root.8.html">advanced safeguards &amp; security features</a> for the <code>sudo</code> command, it’s best to use is sparingly if at all.</p>
<p>Generally, applications will provide a message letting you know if <code>sudo</code> is needed. This might include installing new applications or browsing system configuration files. These decisions are only as safe as you make them, so be sure you’re confident about the changes you’re making before using <code>sudo</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a common trap we’ve mentioned before where <code>sudo</code> comes up frequently: the <code>rm</code> command. Using <code>rm</code> indiscriminately as an unprivileged user can cause you some frustration but is unlikely to do any permanent damage. Using <code>sudo rm</code> in any capacity can wreak havoc on a system and may result in significant data loss.</p>
<p><strong>Never use <code>sudo</code> with <code>rm</code> or with code from the internet that you don’t understand!</strong></p>
<h2 id="bash-scripting">Bash scripting</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about scripting. We’ve used the word “script” quite a few times already, but what exactly is it? A <em>script</em> is simply a text file that we’ve granted permission to execute on our system.</p>
<p>You’ll have lots of opportunities to run scripts for everything from setting up your environment on a new computer to installing new applications. Writing your own scripts is a great way to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="script-requirements">Script requirements</h3>
<p>An effective script requires three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interpreter directive</li>
<li>A commented description</li>
<li>A script body</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>interpreter directive</em> (more commonly called the <em>shebang</em>) is the first line of the script file. It’s used by the operating system to know which application should be used to run your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why “shebang”? This name is a combination of two words: <em>hash</em>, a reference to the octothorpe symbol (<code>#</code>) and <em>bang</em>, a reference to the exclamation point (<code>!</code>). Helpfully, the “shebang” nickname will also help you remember in which order these characters are expected!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example shebang for a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>Adding that line to the top of your script file lets the system know that you’d like to use the application <code>/bin/bash</code> to run your script file. As you learn more scripting languages, you can change change the shebang to make sure the script’s language matches its executing environment.</p>
<p>The commented description is a best practice. Your script won’t fail to run without it, but saving scripts without comments is a dangerous game - if you forget what it is or how it works, you won’t have any reference to help re-learn it! Investing a few minutes in a good comment explaining why you’re writing this script will save you a few of hours of headache down the road. Comments in Bash scripts must be preceded by an octothorpe (<code>#</code>) on each line.</p>
<p>The script body is where the magic happens. Here, you’ll write commands just as you would enter them on your command line, and they’ll be sequentially executed to complete the script. Each line should include a separate command.</p>
<h3 id="a-sample-script">A sample script</h3>
<p>Here’s a very simple “Hello World!” application in Bash:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb143"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-1" title="1"><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-3" title="3"><span class="co"># &quot;Hello, World!&quot; by Alex Martin</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-4" title="4"><span class="co">#</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-5" title="5"><span class="co"># Prints a friendly message to the screen</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb143-7" title="7"><span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Hello, World! &quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that we’ve got all three of our key ingredients for a successful script. All we need is to copy this script into an empty file and make it executable.</p>
<h3 id="updating-running-a-script">Updating &amp; running a script</h3>
<p>Once you’ve written your script into a new file, you need to make that file executable. For security, your system won’t run just any file! You’ll need to mark it “safe” through the magic of <code>chmod</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming our script is called <code>hello-world</code>, this will make the file executable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb144"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb144-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">chmod</span> +x hello-world</a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now run it simply by invoking the file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb145"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb145-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">./hello-world</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb145-2" title="2"><span class="ex">Hello</span>, World!</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how we used <code>./</code> before the script. This isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s a good habit to get into. If we ran just <code>hello-world</code> and happened to have an application called “hello-world” available in our <code>PATH</code>, we might never make it to our own script! Preceding the script name with <code>./</code> ensures we’re going to the run the script with that name in the current directory.</p>

<h1 id="re-learning-functions-with-recursion">Re-learning Functions With Recursion</h1>
<p>Imagine it’s your first day at a new job and your boss has asked you to unpack some fruit crates. Not too bad, right? Now imagine each crate has smaller crates inside. Still easy? Consider even smaller crates, nested within one another, each needing to be unpacked. How long before you throw your hands up in frustration and walk away?</p>
<p>Sometimes simple tasks get complicated and we need new tools to help us solve them. Working with digital data is a little like working with those crates: they may be simple to unpack, or they may be incredibly dense! Let’s explore a new way of approaching problems: <em>recursion</em>.</p>
<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>what recursion is and how to identify it,</li>
<li>implementing recursive functions,</li>
<li>and breaking complex problems down into simpler tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-what-now">Re-what now?</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve solved complex problems with <em>iteration</em>: the process of counting through each item in a collection. Like most things in programming, though, there’s another way! Let’s check out <em>recursion</em>: the process of calling a function within itself.</p>
<p>To wrap your mind around this new concept, think back to that example of crates within crates. If we have to gently unpack each crate but we don’t know the contents, we’ll have to go one-by-one through each crate, pulling items out individually. Let’s think about a better way! What if we open each crate and look inside. If it’s more crates, we dump them out. If it’s fruit, we gently remove the fruit and set it aside.</p>
<p>What might this process look like in code? Here’s some pseudocode to help us think through it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb146"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">gentlyUnpackFruit</span>(contents) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Your &quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> contents <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot; have been unpacked!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-5" title="5"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">dump</span>(crate) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-6" title="6">    <span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="va">crate</span>.<span class="at">content_type</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="st">&quot;crate&quot;</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-7" title="7">        <span class="at">dump</span>(<span class="va">crate</span>.<span class="at">contents</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-8" title="8">    <span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">else</span> <span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="va">crate</span>.<span class="at">content_type</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="st">&quot;fruit&quot;</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-9" title="9">        <span class="at">gentlyUnpackFruit</span>(<span class="va">crate</span>.<span class="at">contents</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-10" title="10">    <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb146-11" title="11"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how we call the <code>dump</code> function from <strong>within</strong> the <code>dump</code> function. That’s recursion in action! The <code>dump</code> function may <em>recurse</em> if we have crates nested within each other.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-language">A note on language</h3>
<p>You’ll notice we’ve used the term <em>recurse</em> here, which you may not have heard before. Technically, the root word in “recursion” is “recur”, but this is ambiguous. Consider these two examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb147"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb147-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb147-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb147-3" title="3"><span class="co">// versus...</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb147-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb147-5" title="5"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Both of these functions <strong>recur</strong> (as in, call the <code>console.log</code> function more than once), but only one of these functions is <strong>recursive</strong> (as in, calling <code>console.log</code> from within another <code>console.log</code>). To reduce confusion, researchers began using the term <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recurse">“recurse”</a> to refer specifically to functions that are being called from within themselves. Creating a new word by removing a suffix in this way is known as <em>back-formation</em>.</p>
<p>We’ll prefer “recurse” when discussing this topic, but you may see “recur” in other places! Carefully read the context and make sure you understand how these words might differ. Interviewers may use the terms interchangeably to trip you up, but we know you’ll be ready for the challenge!</p>
<h2 id="two-cases">Two cases</h2>
<p>Understanding recursion means understanding the two <em>cases</em>, or expected output for a particular input, in a recursive function. These are known as the <em>base case</em> and <em>recursive case</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>base case</em> describes the situation where data passed into our function is processed without any additional recursion. When the base case is executed, the function runs once and ends. Since this results in the function stopping, we may also refer to this as the <em>terminating case</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>recursive case</em>, as the name suggests, is the situation where the function recurses. This represents the data state that causes a function to call itself. Without a recursive case, a function’s just another function!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In our fruit crate example, the base case is “when the crate contains fruit” and the recursive case is “when the crate contains other crates”. When we encounter fruit, we remove the fruit and the action is complete. However, when we encounter more crates, we go back to the start and repeat the whole process again.</p>
<p>Identifying these cases for a process won’t always be that simple, but it’s critical to figure out each one before writing any code. Without a recursive case, we don’t need recursion at all, and we should consider an alternative approach. Without a base case, we might be creating an <em>infinite loop</em> - yikes! We need to know when to stop the process before we start it.</p>
<h2 id="a-recursive-example">A recursive example</h2>
<p>Let’s look at a more practical problem you might encounter in the wild. We’re going to use the “Movie Theater Problem” to demonstrate how recursion can help us with a real world issue.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re meeting a friend in a movie theater. The lights have gone down, it’s totally dark, and your friend just sent you a message asking which row you’re seated in. Without being able to see the rows or your ticket, how might you figure out the row number?</p>
<p>Let’s assume a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theater is mostly occupied, so you can rely on people being in front of &amp; behind you.</li>
<li>You don’t want to knock over anyone’s drinks &amp; snacks, so you must remain in your seat.</li>
<li>Your phone is almost dead, so you can’t use the flashlight or screen to illuminate the seats - no cheating!</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we tap the person in front of us on the shoulder? If there’s someone in front of us, we know that we’re at least one row back from the front of the theater. If someone is in front of <strong>them</strong>, we’re at least <strong>two</strong> rows back! This pattern continues until we reach the screen.</p>
<p>If each person performs this action and they all report back, we can count how many rows back we are! We’ve missed a key part in this analysis, though - when do we stop tapping each other? If someone reaches forward and there’s no one else in front of them, we can assume we’ve reached the front of the theater. That person becomes “Row #1”, and our test stops.</p>
<p>In this example, our base case is “No one in front of me = Row #1” and our recursive case is “Someone in front of me = Row #(1 + person in front of me’s row #)”. Now the we know both cases, we can build a recursive function out of them! Here’s what this might look like in JavaScript:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb148"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-1" title="1">determineRow <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(moviegoer) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="va">moviegoer</span>.<span class="at">personInFront</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-3" title="3">      <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="at">determineRow</span>(<span class="va">moviegoer</span>.<span class="at">personInFront</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-4" title="4">  <span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-5" title="5">      <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-6" title="6">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb148-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it doesn’t matter if our movie theater has 5 rows or 5,000 rows - we have a tool to figure out where we are at any time. We’ve also gone through an important exercise in understanding our space to get here! By working to our sides instead of in front of us, we could use the same process to figure out exactly which seat we’re in on the row.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned-9">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>Whew! If your head is spinning, don’t worry - it’s totally natural. Recursion can get a lot mre complex than what we’ve covered here, but it comes down to working smarter, not harder. We’ll dig a little deeper into advanced recursion and how to know when to build a recursive function in our next lesson.</p>

<p>We know what <em>recursion</em> is, but to truly understand what’s happening, we need to go deeper! Let’s investigate the process of recursion and build a better understanding of the risks involved.</p>

<ul>
<li>recursion and the call stack,</li>
<li>differentiating recursive and iterative functions,</li>
<li>and know when to use each tool for maximum effect.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-deeper-dive-into-recursion">A deeper dive into recursion</h2>
<p>Learning about recursion requires that we review the <em>call stack</em>. Remember that each function call in JavaScript <em>pushes</em> a new <em>stack frame</em> onto the top of the call stack, and the last pushed frame gets <em>popped</em> off as it gets executed. We sometimes refer to this as a <em>Last In, First Out</em>, or <em>LIFO</em>, stack.</p>
<p>Here’s an example to jog your memory:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/asynchronous-functions/assets/stack-trace/04.png" alt="Stack trace reminder from “Call Stack” lesson" /><figcaption>Stack trace reminder from “Call Stack” lesson</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Recursive functions risk placing extra load on the call stack. Each recursive function call depends on the call before it, meaning we can’t start executing a recursive function’s stack frames until we reach the <em>base case</em>. So what happens if we never do? Look out!</p>
<h3 id="london-stack-is-falling-down">London Stack is falling down!</h3>
<p>The JavaScript call stack has a size limit which varies between different browsers and even different systems! Once the stack reaches this limit, we get what’s called a <em>stack overflow</em>. The program halts, the stack gets wiped out entirely, and we’re left with no results wondering what we did wrong.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/recursion/assets/image-recursion-stack-overflow.png" alt="Stack overflow example with call stack" /><figcaption>Stack overflow example with call stack</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s look at an example of an obvious stack overflow issue:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb149"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pythagoreanCup</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-2" title="2">    <span class="at">pythagoreanCup</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb149-5" title="5"><span class="at">pythagoreanCup</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at pythagoreanCup (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at pythagoreanCup (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at pythagoreanCup (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at pythagoreanCup (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at pythagoreanCup (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    ...</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>pythagoreanCup</code> is clearly recursive, since it calls itself, but we’re missing a base case to work towards! This means the function will recurse until the call stack overflows, resulting in a <code>RangeError</code>. Whoops! Notice that in our <em>stack trace</em> (the output below the error name &amp; message), we can see that <code>pythagoreanCup</code> is the only function currently in the call stack.</p>
<p>Fixing the overflow issue in this case is straightforward: determine a base case and implement it in your function. Here’s a fixed version of the example above with some extra comments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb151"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb151-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> justEnoughWine <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">false</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

<blockquote>
<p>The stack size limit varies due to different implementations: some JavaScript environments might have a fixed limit, while others will rely on available memory on your computer. Regardless of your environment, if you’re receiving <code>RangeError</code>s, you should refactor your function! It’s bad practice to build software that only runs in one particular browser or using a specific runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h3>
<p>Notice that our change to <code>pythagoreanCup</code> did two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provided a base case that lets us end the recursion,</li>
<li>and added an action that moves us <strong>towards</strong> the base case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without changing the value of <code>justEnoughWine</code>, we would never enter the base case and our stack would still be at risk of growing out of control.</p>
<p>We refer to the action that gets us closer to the base case as the <em>recursive step</em>. Don’t forget to build this step into your function! Your base case doesn’t mean anything if you’re not moving towards it with each recurrence.</p>

<p>Our examples of recursion so far have involved a single function calling itself. We refer to this situation as <em>direct recursion</em>: functions directly calling themselves. There’s a trickier type of recursion to debug, though. Take a look at the following example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb153"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">didYouDoTheThing</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-2" title="2">    <span class="at">ofCourseIDidTheThing</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-5" title="5"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">ofCourseIDidTheThing</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-6" title="6">    <span class="at">didYouDoTheThing</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-8" title="8"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb153-9" title="9"><span class="at">didYouDoTheThing</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Uh oh! Neither of these functions appears to be recursive by itself, but calling either of them will put us into a recursive loop with no base case in sight. We refer to recursive loops across multiple functions as <em>indirect recursion</em>. There’s nothing wrong with using this technique, but be careful! Because the call stack will have multiple function names in it, debugging problems with indirectly recursive functions can be a headache.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-iterate-when-to-recur">When to iterate, when to recur</h2>
<p>Alright, slow down, programmers. Before you rewrite all your recent projects to use recursive functions, let’s investigate why you might choose iteration instead.</p>
<p>Remember that <em>iteration</em> is when we call a function for each member of a collection, instead of letting the function call itself. So far, the code you’ve written using <code>for</code> loops and iterator functions like <code>.forEach</code> has been <em>iterative</em>. Iterative code tends to be less resource-intensive than recursive code, and it requires less planning to get working. It’s also usually easier to read &amp; understand - an important thing to consider when writing software!</p>
<p>Iterative approaches tend to break down when our data becomes <em>very complex</em> or <em>very large</em>. Consider the task of sorting paper folders by the number of files in each. If you only had a few folders, this wouldn’t be very daunting, and you could take an iterative approach: open each folder individually, count the files, and place the folders in the correct order.</p>
<p>However, if you had thousands or even millions of folders, iteration would take days instead of minutes. You’d want time to implement a system for getting through those folders efficiently, and that system would likely involve a procedure for ordering in batches. This is exactly what recursive functions do best: repetitive processes on subsets of given data.</p>
<p>Consider recursion when your inputs are unpredictable, large, or highly complex. Otherwise, iteration will almost always be the best approach. We’ll look at lots of examples to help you get a feel for this before someone asks you to identify the best approach to a given problem in an interview</p>
<h2 id="compare-these-approaches">Compare these approaches</h2>
<p>Before we move on, let’s compare an iterative &amp; recursive approach with each other. We’ll create a <code>countdown</code> function that takes a number and counts down from that number to zero.</p>
<p>Here’s an iterative approach:</p>

<h1 id="recursion-problems">Recursion Problems</h1>
<p>Here we <code>go(go(go()))</code>! It’s time to flex your coding muscles on recursion. For each problem, implement a <strong>recursive</strong> function that satisfies all the listed requirements. Iterative solutions will be considered incorrect. The problems aren’t dependent on each other and may be completed in any order you wish.</p>
<p>As you complete each problem, use <code>mocha</code> to test your solutions. Make sure you’re in the project’s root: you should be in the same place as the <code>problems/</code> and <code>test/</code> directories. Once there, run the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb156"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb156-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">mocha</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Having trouble? Reach out to a TA for assistance! Once you’ve completed the first 5 problems and all tests are passing, you can move onto the 6th bonus problem.</p>
<p>We know you’ve got this!</p>

<h1 id="debugging-a-stack-overflow">Debugging A Stack Overflow</h1>
<p>Uh oh! We’ve written a recursive function, but it’s throwing an error! Investigate the included problem and see if you can figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p>Once you think you’ve fixed the issue, use <code>mocha</code> to confirm. Make sure you’re in the project’s root: you should be in the same place as the <code>problems/</code> and <code>test/</code> directories. Once there, run the following command:</p>

<p>It’s time to learn about some built in JavaScript functionality that will allow you to define an anonymous function and then immediately run that function as soon as it has been defined. In JavaScript we call this an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression or IIFE (pronounced as “iffy”).</p>
<p>When you finish this reading you should be able to identify an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression, as well as write your own.</p>
<h2 id="quick-review-of-function-expressions">Quick review of function expressions</h2>
<p>Before we get started talking about IIFEs lets quickly do a review of the syntax anonymous function expressions.</p>
<p>A function expression is when you define a function and assign that function to a variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb158"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-1" title="1"><span class="co">// here we are assigning a named function declaration to a variable</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> sayHi <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">sayHello</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb158-6" title="6"><span class="at">sayHi</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also use function expression syntax to assign variables to anonymous functions effectively giving them names:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb159"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-1" title="1"><span class="co">// here we are assigning an anonymous function declaration to a variable</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> sayHi <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb159-6" title="6"><span class="at">sayHi</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now what if we only ever wanted to invoke the above anonymous function once? We didn’t want to assign it a name? To do that we can define an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression.</p>
<h2 id="iife-syntax">IIFE syntax</h2>
<p>An <em>Immediately-Invoked Function Expression</em> is a function that is called immediately after it had been defined. The typical syntax we use to write an IIFE is to start by writing an anonymous function and then wrapping that function with the grouping operator, <code>( )</code>. After the anonymous function is wrapped in parenthesis you simply add another pair of closed parenthesis to invoke your function.</p>
<p>Here is the syntax as described:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb160"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb160-1" title="1"><span class="co">// 1. wrap the anonymous function in the grouping operator</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb160-2" title="2"><span class="co">// 2. invoke the function!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb160-3" title="3">(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb160-4" title="4">  statements<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb160-5" title="5"><span class="op">}</span>)()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example. The below function will be invoked right after it has been defined:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb161"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb161-1" title="1">(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb161-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;run me immediately!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb161-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// =&gt; &#39;run me immediately!&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Our above function will be defined, invoked, and then will <em>never be invoked again</em>. What we are doing with the above syntax is forcing JavaScript to run our function as a <strong>function expression</strong> and then to invoke that function expression immediately.</p>
<p>Since an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression is <em>immediately invoked</em> attempting to assign an IIFE to a variable will return the value of the invoked function.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb162"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> result <span class="op">=</span> (<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-2" title="2">  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="st">&quot;party!&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span>)()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb162-5" title="5"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(result)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;party!&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So we can use IIFEs to run an anonymous function immediately and we can still hold onto the result of that function by assigning the IIFE to a variable.</p>
<h2 id="iifes-keep-functions-and-variables-private">IIFEs keep functions and variables private</h2>
<p>Using IIFEs ensures our global namespace remains unpolluted by a ton of function or variable names we don’t intend to reuse. IIFEs can additionally protect global variables to ensure they can’t ever be read or overwritten by our program. In short using an IIFE is a way of protecting not only the variables within a function, but the function itself. Let’s explore how IIFEs do this.</p>
<p>When learning about scope we talked about how an outer scope does not have access to an inner scope’s variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb163"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">nameGen</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">const</span> bName <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Barry&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(bName)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-6" title="6"><span class="co">// we can not reference the bName variable from this outer scope</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-7" title="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(bName)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb163-8" title="8"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">nameGen</span>())<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Barry&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now what if we didn’t want our outer scope to be able to access our function at all? Say we wanted our <code>nameGen</code> function to only be invoked once and not ever be invoked again or even to be accessible by our application again? This is where IIFEs come in to the rescue.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages gained by using an IIFE is the very fact that the function cannot be invoked after the initial invocation. Meaning that no other part of our program can ever access this function again.</p>
<p>Since we don’t ever intend to invoke this function again - there is no point in assigning a name to our function. Let’s take a look at rewriting our nameGen function using a sneaky IIFE:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb164"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-1" title="1">(<span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">const</span> bName <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Barry&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(bName)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span>)()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Barry&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-6" title="6"><span class="co">// we still cannot reference the bName variable from this outer scope</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-7" title="7"><span class="co">// and now we have no hope of ever running the above function above again</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-8" title="8"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(bName)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="what-you-learned-1">What you learned</h2>
<p>How to identify an IIFE, as well as how to write one.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="interpolation-in-javascript">Interpolation in JavaScript</h1>
<p>When working with the <code>String</code> primitive type in JavaScript, you’ve probably noticed it is not always an easy experience adding in variables or working with multi-line strings. In the ES6 edition of JavaScript one of the new features that was introduced to help with this problem was the Template Literal. A Template Literal is a new way to create a string literal that expands on the syntax of the <code>String</code> primitive type allowing for interpolated expressions to be inserted easily into strings.</p>
<p>When you finish this reading you should be able to interpolate a string using template literals.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk-syntax">Let’s talk syntax</h2>
<p>To create a template literal, instead of single quotes (<code>'</code>) or double quotes (<code>"</code>) we use the grave character, also known as the backtick (`). Defining a new string using a template literal is easy - we can simply use backticks to create that new string:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb165"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> apple <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`apple`</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb165-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(apple)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// apple</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The important thing to know is that a template literal is still a <code>String</code> - just with some really nifty features! The real benefits of template literals become more obvious when we start talking about interpolation.</p>
<h3 id="interpolation-using-template-literals">Interpolation using template literals</h3>
<p>One of the main advantages we gain by using template literals is the ability to <em>interpolate</em> variables or expressions into strings. We do this by denoting the values we’d like to interpolate by wrapping them within curly braces with a dollar sign in front(<code>${}</code>). When your code is being run - the variables or expressions wrapped within the <code>${}</code> will be evaluated and then will be replaced with the value of that variable or expression.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at that syntax by looking at a simple example. Compare how easy to read the following two functions are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb166"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-1" title="1"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-2" title="2"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">boringSayHello</span>(name) <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-3" title="3">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello &quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> name <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-4" title="4"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-6" title="6"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">templateSayHello</span>(name) <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-7" title="7">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="vs">`Hello </span><span class="sc">${</span>name<span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs">!`</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-8" title="8"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-9" title="9"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-10" title="10"><span class="at">boringSayHello</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Joe&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Hello Joe!&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb166-11" title="11"><span class="at">templateSayHello</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Joe&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;Hello Joe!&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see in the above example, the value of the variable is being interpolated into the string that is being created using the template literal. This makes our code easier to both write and read.</p>
<p>You’ll most often be interpolating variables with template literals, however we can also interpolate expressions. Here is an example of evaluating an expression within a template literal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb167"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb167-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> string <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`Let me tell you </span><span class="sc">${</span><span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs"> things!`</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

<h1 id="object-keys-in-javascript">Object Keys in JavaScript</h1>
<p>As we previously covered, the Object type in JavaScript is a data structure that stores key value pairs. An object’s <code>values</code> can be anything: Booleans, Functions, other Objects, etc. Up to this point we have been using strings as our object <code>keys</code>. However, as of ES6 edition of JS we can use another data type to create Object keys: <code>Symbols</code>.</p>
<p>In this reading we’ll be talking about the <code>Symbol</code> primitive data type and how an object’s keys can be either a <code>String</code> <em>or</em> a <code>Symbol</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-symbol-of-unique-freedom">A symbol of unique freedom</h2>
<p>The main advantage of using the immutable <code>Symbol</code> primitive data type is that each <code>Symbol</code> value is <strong>unique</strong>. Once a symbol has been created it <strong>cannot</strong> be recreated.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the syntax used to create a new symbol:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb170"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb170-1" title="1"><span class="co">// the description is an optional string used for debugging</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb170-2" title="2"><span class="at">Symbol</span>([description])<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>To create a new symbol you call the <code>Symbol()</code> function which will return a new unique symbol:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb171"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> sym1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb171-3" title="3"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(sym1)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// Symbol()</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here is an example of how each created symbol is guaranteed to be <strong>unique</strong>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb172"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> sym1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> sym2 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb172-4" title="4"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(sym1 <span class="op">===</span> sym2)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// false</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can additionally pass in an optional <code>description</code> string that will allow for easier debugging by giving you an identifier for the symbol you are working with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb173"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> symApple <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb173-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(symApple)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// Symbol(apple)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Don’t confuse the optional <code>description</code> string as way to access the Symbol you defining though - the string value isn’t included in the Symbol in anyway. We can invoke the <code>Symbol()</code> function multiple times with the same description string and each newly returned symbol will be unique:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb174"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> symApple1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> symApple2 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-4" title="4"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(symApple1)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// Symbol(apple)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-5" title="5"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(symApple2)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// Symbol(apple)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-6" title="6"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(symApple1 <span class="op">===</span> symApple2)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// false</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb174-7" title="7"><span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;foo&quot;</span>) <span class="op">===</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;foo&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// returns false</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we’ve learned how to define symbols and that symbols are unique it’s time to talk about <em>why</em> you would use a symbol. The main way the <code>Symbol</code> primitive data type is used in JavaScript is to create unique object keys.</p>
<h2 id="symbols-vs.-strings-as-keys-in-objects">Symbols vs. Strings as keys in Objects</h2>
<p>Before the ES6 edition of JavaScript Object keys were exclusively strings. We could you either dot or bracket notation to set or access an object’s string key’s value.</p>
<p>Here is a brief refresher on that syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb175"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> dog <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-2" title="2">dog[<span class="st">&quot;sound&quot;</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;woof&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-3" title="3"><span class="va">dog</span>.<span class="at">age</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">4</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-4" title="4"><span class="co">// using bracket notation with a variable</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-5" title="5"><span class="kw">const</span> col <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;color&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-6" title="6">dog[col] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;grey&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb175-8" title="8"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(dog)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// { sound: &#39;woof&#39;, age: 4, color: &#39;grey&#39; }</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>One of the problems with using strings as object keys is that in the Object type each key is <em>unique</em>. Meaning that sometimes we could inadvertently overwrite a key’s value if we mistakenly try to reassign the same key name twice:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb176"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> dog <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-2" title="2"><span class="co">// I set an &#39;id&#39; key value pair on my dog</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-3" title="3">dog[<span class="st">&quot;id&quot;</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">39</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-5" title="5"><span class="co">// Here imagine someone else comes into my code base and</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-6" title="6"><span class="co">// accidentally adds another key with the same name!</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-7" title="7"><span class="va">dog</span>.<span class="at">id</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">42</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-8" title="8"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb176-9" title="9"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(dog)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">//  { id: 42 }</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>When a computer program attempts to use the same variable name twice for different values we call this a <em>name collision</em>. While the above code snippet is a contrived example, it is a good demonstration of a common issue. Further on in this course you’ll find yourself installing many code libraries (like the <code>mocha</code> test library) for each project you work on. The more libraries that are imported into a single application the greater the chance of a name collision.</p>
<p>I bet you are sensing a <em>unique</em> theme by now. Using <code>Symbols</code> as your object keys is a great way to prevent name collision on objects because Symbols are <em>unique</em>!</p>
<p>Let take a took at how we could fix the above code snippet using symbols:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb177"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> dog <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-2" title="2"><span class="kw">const</span> dogId <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;id&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-3" title="3">dog[dogId] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">39</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-5" title="5"><span class="kw">const</span> secondDogId <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;id&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-6" title="6">dog[secondDogId] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">42</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-8" title="8"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(dog[dogId])<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">//  39</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb177-9" title="9"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(dog)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">//  { [Symbol(id)]: 39, [Symbol(id)]: 42 }</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Note above that we can access our key value pair using bracket notation and passing in the variable we assigned our symbol to (in this case <code>dogId</code>).</p>
<h3 id="iterating-through-objects-with-symbol-keys">Iterating through objects with symbol keys</h3>
<p>One of the other ways that <code>Symbols</code> differ from <code>String</code> keys in an object is the way we iterate through an object. Since <code>Symbols</code> are relatively new to JavaScript older Object iteration methods don’t know about them.</p>
<p>This includes using <code>for...each</code> and <code>Object.keys()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb178"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb178-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">Symbol</span>(<span class="st">&quot;name&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>This provides an additional bonus to using symbols as object keys because your symbol keys that much more hidden (and safe) if they aren’t accessible via the normal object iteration methods.</p>
<p>If we do want to access all the symbols in an object we can use the built in <code>Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()</code>. Let’s take a look at that:</p>

<p>Using symbols as object keys has some advantages in your local code but they become really beneficial when dealing with importing larger libraries of code into your own projects. The more code imported into one place means the more variables floating around which leads to a greater chance of a name collisions - which can lead to some really devious debugging.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learned-3">What you learned</h2>
<p>There are two primitive data types that can be used to create keys on an Object in JavaScript: <code>Strings</code> and <code>Symbols</code>. The main advantage to using a <code>Symbol</code> as an object’s key is that Symbols are guaranteed to be <strong>unique</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="primitive-data-types-in-depth">Primitive Data Types in Depth</h2>
<p>It’s time to dive deeper into the world of JavaScript data types! Previously, we learned about the difference between the Primitive and Reference data types. The main difference we covered between the two data types is that primitive types are immutable, meaning they cannot change. It’s now time to dive a little deeper into this subject and talk about how primitive data types are not just immutable in terms of reassignment - and also because we are not able to define new methods on primitive data types in JavaScript.</p>
<p>At the end of this reading you you be able to identify why primitive types do not have methods.</p>
<h2 id="data-types-in-javascript">Data types in JavaScript</h2>
<p>With the JavaScript ECMAScript 2015 release, there are now eight different data types in JavaScript. There are seven primitive types and one reference type.</p>
<p>Below we have listed JS data types along with a brief description of each type.</p>
<p><strong>Primitive Types</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>Boolean</code> - <code>true</code> and <code>false</code></li>
<li><code>Null</code> - represents the intentional absence of value.</li>
<li><code>Undefined</code> - default return value for many things in JavaScript.</li>
<li><code>Number</code> - like the numbers we usually use (<code>15</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>42</code>)</li>
<li><code>String</code> - ordered collection of characters (‘apple’)</li>
<li><code>Symbol</code> - new to ES5 a symbol is a <em>unique</em> primitive value</li>
<li><code>BigInt</code> - a data type that can represent larger integers than the <code>Number</code> type can safely handle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>One Reference Type</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>Object</code> - a collection of properties and methods</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have previously discussed one of the main differences between primitive and reference data types in JavaScript is that primitive data types are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning that they cannot be changed. The other main thing that sets primitives apart is that primitive data types are not Objects and therefore <em>do not have methods</em>.</p>
<h2 id="methods-and-the-object-type">Methods and the object type</h2>
<p>When we first learned about the Object data type we learned about the definition of a <em>method</em>. As a reminder, the definition of a method is a function that belongs to an object.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb180"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> corgi <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">name</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;Ein&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-3" title="3">  <span class="dt">func</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">function</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-4" title="4">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;This is a method!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-5" title="5">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-6" title="6"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb180-8" title="8"><span class="va">corgi</span>.<span class="at">func</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints &quot;This is a method!&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The Object type is the only data type in JavaScript that has methods. <strong>Meaning that primitive data types cannot have methods.</strong> That’s right - we cannot declare new methods or use any methods on JavaScript primitive data types because they are Objects.</p>
<p>For example when finding the square root of a number in JavaScript we would do the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb181"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb181-1" title="1"><span class="co">// This works because we are calling the Math object&#39;s method sqrt</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb181-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">sqrt</span>(<span class="dv">25</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 5</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb181-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb181-4" title="4"><span class="co">// This will NOT work because the Number primitive has NO METHODS</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb181-5" title="5"><span class="kw">let</span> num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">25.</span>sqrt<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Number</code> primitive data type above (<code>25</code>) does not have a <code>sqrt</code> method because only Objects in JavaScript can have methods. To sum up the previous sections: Primitive data types are <strong>not</strong> Objects therefore they do not have methods.</p>
<h2 id="primitives-with-object-wrappers">Primitives with object wrappers</h2>
<p>Right now you might be thinking - wait a second what about the string type? After all, we can call <code>String#toUpperCase</code> on an instance of a string? Well that is because of how the string type is implemented in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The underlying primitive data type of <code>String</code> does not have methods. However, to make the String data type easier to work with in JavaScript it is implemented using a <code>String</code> object that <em>wraps</em> around the <code>String</code> primitive data type. This means that the <code>String</code> object will be responsible for constructing new <code>String</code> primitive data types as well as allowing us to call methods upon it because it is an Object.</p>
<p>We’ll be diving a lot more into this concept when we get to JavaScript Classes but for brevity’s sake we are going to do a walkthough of the code snippet below to clarify the difference between the <code>String</code> primitive type, and the <code>String</code> object that wraps around it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb182"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> str1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-3" title="3"><span class="va">str1</span>.<span class="at">toUpperCase</span>()<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// returns APPLE</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-5" title="5"><span class="kw">let</span> str2 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">str1</span>.<span class="at">toUpperCase</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-7" title="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(str1)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">//prints apple</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb182-8" title="8"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(str2)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">//prints APPLE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So in the above example when we call <code>str1.toUpperCase()</code> we are calling that on the <code>String</code> object that wraps around the <code>String</code> primitive type.</p>
<p>This is why in the above example when we <code>console.log</code> both <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code> we can see they are different. The value of <code>str1</code> has not changed because it can’t - the <code>String</code> primitive type is <em>immutable</em>. The <code>str2</code> variable calls the <code>String#toUpperCase</code> method on the <code>String</code> object which wraps around the <code>String</code> primitive. This method cannot mutate the <code>String</code> primitive type itself - it can only point to a new place in memory where the <code>String</code> primitive for <code>APPLE</code> lives. This is why even though we call <code>str1.toUpperCase()</code> multiple times the value of that variable will never change until we reassign it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if this is confusing at first, as we dive more into JavaScript you’ll learn more about how JavaScript implements different types of Objects to try and make writing code as clear as possible.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learned-4">What you learned</h2>
<p>The important takeaway here is that primitive data types in JavaScript are not objects and therefore cannot have methods.</p>

<h1 id="unassigned-variables-in-javascript">Unassigned Variables in JavaScript</h1>
<p>Up this point we’ve covered a lot of of information about the different ways to declare a variable in JavaScript. This reading is going to center in on a topic we’ve touched on but haven’t gone over in great detail: what is the value of a declared variable with no assigned value?</p>
<p>By the end of this reading you should be able to look at a code snippet and predict the value of any declared variable that is not assigned a value.</p>
<h2 id="the-default-value-of-variables">The default value of variables</h2>
<p>Whenever you declare a <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> variable in JavaScript that variable will have a <em>name</em> and a <em>value</em>. That is true of <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> variables with no assigned value either! When declaring a variable using <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> we can optionally assign a value to that variable.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of declaring a variable with <code>var</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb183"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb183-1" title="1"><span class="kw">var</span> hello<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb183-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(hello)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints undefined</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So when we declare a variable using <code>var</code> the default value assigned to that variable will be <code>undefined</code> if no value is assigned.</p>
<p>The same is true of declaring a variable using <code>let</code>. When declaring a variable using <code>let</code> we can also choose to optionally assign a value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb184"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb184-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> goodbye<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb184-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(goodbye)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints undefined</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>However, this is a case where <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variables differ. When declaring a variable with <code>const</code> we must provide a value for that variable to be assigned to.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb185"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb185-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> goodbye<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb185-2" title="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(goodbye)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This behavior makes sense because a <code>const</code> variable cannot be reassigned - meaning that is we don’t assign a value when a <code>const</code> variable is declared we’d never be able to assign a new value!</p>
<p>So the default assigned value of a variable declared using <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> is <code>undefined</code>, whereas variables declared using <code>const</code> need to be assigned a value.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-default-values-and-hoisting">The difference between default values and hoisting</h2>
<p>When talking about default values for variables we should also make sure to underline the distinction between <em>hoisting</em> variable names and default values.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb186"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">var</span> hello<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(hello)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints undefined</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb186-6" title="6"><span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Whenever a variable is declared with <code>var</code> that variable’s name is hoisted to the top of its declared scope with a value of <code>undefined</code> until a value is assigned to that variable name. If we never assign a value to the declared variable name then the default value of a <code>var</code> declared variable is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the example above but this time using <code>let</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb187"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">let</span> hello<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-3" title="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(hello)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints undefined</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb187-6" title="6"><span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The default value of a <code>let</code> declared variable is <code>undefined</code>. However, don’t confuse this with how a <code>let</code> defined variable is hoisted. When a <code>let</code> variable is declared the name of that variable is hoisted to the top of its declared scope and if a line of code attempts to interact with that variable before it has been assigned a value an error is thrown.</p>
<p>The following example shows the difference in <strong>hoisting</strong> between <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> declared variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb188"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-2" title="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(hello)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// prints undefined</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-3" title="3">  <span class="kw">var</span> hello<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-5" title="5">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(goodbye)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// ReferenceError: Cannot access &#39;goodbye&#39; before initialization</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-6" title="6">  <span class="kw">let</span> goodbye<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-7" title="7"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-8" title="8"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb188-9" title="9"><span class="at">hoistBuddy</span>()<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="what-you-learned-5">What you learned</h2>
<p>The default value of a variable assigned with either <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> is <code>undefined</code>. Variables declared using <code>const</code> need to have an assigned value upon declaration to be valid.</p>

<h1 id="whiteboarding-problem">WhiteBoarding Problem</h1>
<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>Write a function named <code>dynamicDivider(divisor)</code>. When invoked the <code>dynamicDivider</code> function will intake a number to be used as a divisor and will then return a new function. The function returned by <code>dynamicDivider</code> will accept a number - and that number will then be divided by the <code>divisor</code> that was defined when the <code>dynamicDivider</code> was first invoked.</p>
