### [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor that lets you type in and play around with text or code in amazing ways.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was the first major player in the platform as a service boom that hit developers by storm.

[![heroku.jpg](https://tutorialzine.com/media/2014/08/heroku.jpg)](https://www.heroku.com/)
