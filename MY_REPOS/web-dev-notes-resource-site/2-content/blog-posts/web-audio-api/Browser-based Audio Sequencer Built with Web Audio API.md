# Browser-based Audio Sequencer Built with Web Audio API

> Sparkboxer Jon shares a browser-based audio sequencer he built. He shows how, using Web Audio API and tone.js, he created a synthesizer that makes chiptune-style music.

[We like to build things](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/resources). We also like to share what we’ve learned along the way. During a recent Lunch n’ Learn session, Jon shared a browser-based audio sequencer that he built using Web Audio API. And now we’re sharing it with you!

Check out [the sequencer](https://jonoliver.codes/sequencer/) and [oscillator example](https://codepen.io/jonoliver/pen/NoawPv) from the video. And take a look at [the web audio library](https://tonejs.github.io/).
