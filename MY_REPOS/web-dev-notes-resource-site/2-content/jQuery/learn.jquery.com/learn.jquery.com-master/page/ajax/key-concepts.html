<p>Proper use of Ajax-related jQuery methods requires understanding some key concepts first.</p>
<h3 id="get-vs.-post">GET vs. POST</h3>
<p>The two most common “methods” for sending a request to a server are GET and POST. It’s important to understand the proper application of each.</p>
<p>The GET method should be used for non-destructive operations — that is, operations where you are only “getting” data from the server, not changing data on the server. For example, a query to a search service might be a GET request. GET requests may be cached by the browser, which can lead to unpredictable behavior if you are not expecting it. GET requests generally send all of their data in a query string.</p>
<p>The POST method should be used for destructive operations — that is, operations where you are changing data on the server. For example, a user saving a blog post should be a POST request. POST requests are generally not cached by the browser; a query string can be part of the URL, but the data tends to be sent separately as post data.</p>
<h3 id="data-types">Data Types</h3>
<p>jQuery generally requires some instruction as to the type of data you expect to get back from an Ajax request; in some cases the data type is specified by the method name, and in other cases it is provided as part of a configuration object. There are several options:</p>
<h4 id="text">text</h4>
<p>For transporting simple strings.</p>
<h4 id="html">html</h4>
<p>For transporting blocks of HTML to be placed on the page.</p>
<h4 id="script">script</h4>
<p>For adding a new script to the page.</p>
<h4 id="json">json</h4>
<p>For transporting JSON-formatted data, which can include strings, arrays, and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of jQuery 1.4, if the JSON data sent by your server isn’t properly formatted, the request may fail silently. See <a href="http://json.org">http://json.org</a> for details on properly formatting JSON, but as a general rule, use built-in language methods for generating JSON on the server to avoid syntax issues.</p>
<h4 id="jsonp">jsonp</h4>
<p>For transporting JSON data from another domain.</p>
<h4 id="xml">xml</h4>
<p>For transporting data in a custom XML schema.</p>
<p>Consider using the JSON format in most cases, as it provides the most flexibility. It is especially useful for sending both HTML and data at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="a-is-for-asynchronous">A is for Asynchronous</h3>
<p>The asynchronicity of Ajax catches many new jQuery users off guard. Because Ajax calls are asynchronous by default, the response is not immediately available. Responses can only be handled using a callback. So, for example, the following code will not work:</p>
<pre><code>var response;

$.get( &quot;foo.php&quot;, function( r ) {
    response = r;
});

console.log( response ); // undefined</code></pre>
<p>Instead, we need to pass a callback function to our request; this callback will run when the request succeeds, at which point we can access the data that it returned, if any.</p>
<pre><code>$.get( &quot;foo.php&quot;, function( response ) {
    console.log( response ); // server response
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="same-origin-policy-and-jsonp">Same-Origin Policy and JSONP</h3>
<p>In general, Ajax requests are limited to the same protocol (http or https), the same port, and the same domain as the page making the request. This limitation does not apply to scripts that are loaded via jQuery’s Ajax methods.</p>
<p>The other exception is requests targeted at a JSONP service on another domain. In the case of JSONP, the provider of the service has agreed to respond to your request with a script that can be loaded into the page using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, thus avoiding the same-origin limitation; that script will include the data you requested, wrapped in a callback function you provide.</p>
<h3 id="ajax-and-firebug">Ajax and Firebug</h3>
<p>Firebug (or the Webkit Inspector in Chrome or Safari) is an invaluable tool for working with Ajax requests. You can see Ajax requests as they happen in the Console tab of Firebug (and in the Resources &gt; XHR panel of Webkit Inspector), and you can click on a request to expand it and see details such as the request headers, response headers, response content, and more. If something isn’t going as expected with an Ajax request, this is the first place to look to track down what’s wrong.</p>
