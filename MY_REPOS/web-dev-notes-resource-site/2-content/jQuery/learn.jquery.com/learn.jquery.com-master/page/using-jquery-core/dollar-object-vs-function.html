        <p>Until now, we’ve been dealing entirely with methods that are called on a jQuery object. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>$( &quot;h1&quot; ).remove();</code></pre>
        <p>Most jQuery methods are called on jQuery objects as shown above; these methods are said to be part of the
            <code>$.fn</code> namespace, or the “jQuery prototype,” and are best thought of as jQuery object methods.
        </p>
        <p>However, there are several methods that do not act on a selection; these methods are said to be part of the
            jQuery namespace, and are best thought of as core jQuery methods.</p>
        <p>This distinction can be incredibly confusing to new jQuery users. Here’s what you need to remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Methods called on jQuery selections are in the <code>$.fn</code> namespace, and automatically receive
                and return the selection as <code>this</code>.</li>
            <li>Methods in the <code>$</code> namespace are generally utility-type methods, and do not work with
                selections; they are not automatically passed any arguments, and their return value will vary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are a few cases where object methods and core methods have the same names, such as
            <code>$.each()</code> and <code>.each()</code>. In these cases, be extremely careful when reading the
            documentation that you are exploring the correct method.
        </p>
        <p>In this guide, if a method can be called on a jQuery selection, we’ll refer to it just by its name:
            <code>.each()</code>. If it is a <a href="/using-jquery-core/utility-methods/">utility method</a> – that is,
            a method that isn’t called on a selection – we’ll refer to it explicitly as a method in the jQuery
            namespace: <code>$.each()</code>.
