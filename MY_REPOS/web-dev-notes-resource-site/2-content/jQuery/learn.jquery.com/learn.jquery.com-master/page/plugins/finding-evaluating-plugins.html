    <p>One of the most celebrated aspects of jQuery is its extensive plugin ecosystem. From table sorting to form
        validation to autocompletion – if there’s a need for it, chances are good that someone has written a plugin for
        it.</p>
    <p>The quality of jQuery plugins varies widely. Many plugins are extensively tested and well-maintained, but others
        are hastily created and then ignored. More than a few fail to follow best practices. Some plugins, mainly <a
            href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>, are maintained by the jQuery team. The quality of these plugins
        is as good as jQuery itself.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to find plugins is to search Google or the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/">jQuery Plugins
            Registry</a>. Once you’ve identified some options, you may want to consult the <a
            href="http://forum.jquery.com/">jQuery forums</a> or the <code>#jquery</code> IRC channel to get input from
        others.</p>
    <p>When looking for a plugin to fill a need, do your homework. Ensure that the plugin is well-documented, and look
        for the author to provide lots of examples of its use. Be wary of plugins that do far more than you need; they
        can end up adding substantial overhead to your page. For more tips on spotting a sub-par plugin, read <a
            href="http://remysharp.com/2010/06/03/signs-of-a-poorly-written-jquery-plugin/">Signs of a poorly written
            jQuery plugin</a> by Remy Sharp.</p>
    <p>Once you choose a plugin, you’ll need to add it to your page. Download the plugin, unzip it if necessary, place
        it within your application’s directory structure, then include the plugin in your page using a script tag (after
        you include jQuery).</p>
