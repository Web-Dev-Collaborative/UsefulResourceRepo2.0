<h1 id="the-jquery-learning-site">The jQuery Learning Site</h1>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The goal of this site is twofold:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>To serve as a central, trustworthy, narrative compendium of information about how to use jQuery and JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>To remain a timely, vibrant, and community-driven reference with a relatively low barrier to contribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the initial content - and spirit - comes from <a href="http://jqfundamentals.com/legacy">jQuery
        Fundamentals</a>, an open-source book about jQuery, originally written by <a
        href="http://www.rmurphey.com/">Rebecca Murphey</a> and released in 2010. In 2011, Rebecca <a
        href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2011/03/17/the-future-of-jquery-fundamentals-and-a-confession/">bequeathed the
        book</a> unto the jQuery Foundation to serve as the basis for this site.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-site-works">How This Site Works</h2>
<p>This site’s core content consists of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files. The
    template that controls the site’s appearance is a <a
        href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/master/themes/learn.jquery.com">child theme</a> of <a
        href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content">jquery-wp-content</a>, and any issues with the presentation
    should be directed to <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content">that repository</a>.</p>
<h3 id="site-organization">Site Organization</h3>
<p>All of the content lives inside of the subdirectories of the <code>page</code> directory. Each of these
    subdirectories is considered a <strong>chapter</strong>, and contains one or more <strong>articles</strong>, and
    there is also a top level file that corresponds to each chapter, which contains the chapter’s human-readable title
    and an overview, which will appear on the chapter’s landing page.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/master/order.json"><code>order.json</code></a> file
    controls the order that chapters and articles appear in the site.</p>
<h3 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h3>
<p>Each of the articles on the site has some JSON “Front Matter” that contains metadata. All articles should include the
    following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>title</code> - The title of the article as it will appear in the site.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>"title": "jQuery Event Extensions"</code></p>
<ul>
    <li><code>level</code> - The approximate level of jQuery experience required to find the article useful. Options:
        <code>beginner</code>, <code>intermediate</code>, or <code>advanced</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><code>"level": "advanced"</code></p>
