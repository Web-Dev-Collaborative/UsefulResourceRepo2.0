        "title": "How do I select an element by an ID that has characters used in CSS notation?"
    }
</script>
<p>Because jQuery uses CSS syntax for selecting elements, some characters are interpreted as CSS notation. For example,
    ID attributes, after an initial letter (a-z or A-Z), may also use periods and colons, in addition to letters,
    numbers, hyphens, and underscores (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id">W3C Basic HTML Data
        Types</a>). The colon (“:”) and period (“.”) are problematic within the context of a jQuery selector because
    they indicate a pseudo-class and class, respectively.</p>
<p>In order to tell jQuery to treat these characters literally rather than as CSS notation, they must be “escaped” by
    placing two backslashes in front of them.</p>
<pre><code>// Does not work:
$( &quot;#some:id&quot; )

// Works!
$( &quot;#some\\:id&quot; )

// Does not work:
$( &quot;#some.id&quot; )

// Works!
$( &quot;#some\\.id&quot; )</code></pre>
<p>The following function takes care of escaping these characters and places a “#” at the beginning of the ID string:
</p>
<pre><code>function jq( myid ) {

    return &quot;#&quot; + myid.replace( /(:|\.|\[|\]|,)/g, &quot;\\$1&quot; );

}</code></pre>
<p>The function can be used like so:</p>
<pre><code>$( jq( &quot;some.id&quot; ) )</code></pre>
