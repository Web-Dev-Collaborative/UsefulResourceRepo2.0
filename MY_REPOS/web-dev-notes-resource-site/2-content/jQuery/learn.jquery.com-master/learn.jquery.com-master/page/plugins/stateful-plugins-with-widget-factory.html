    <h2 id="writing-stateful-plugins-with-the-jquery-ui-widget-factory">Writing Stateful Plugins with the jQuery UI
        Widget Factory</h2>
    <p>While most existing jQuery plugins are stateless – that is, we call them on an element and that is the extent of
        our interaction with the plugin – there’s a large set of functionality that doesn’t fit into the basic plugin
        pattern.</p>
    <p>In order to fill this gap, jQuery UI has implemented a more advanced plugin system. The new system manages state,
        allows multiple functions to be exposed via a single plugin, and provides various extension points. This system
        is called the Widget Factory and is exposed as <code>jQuery.widget</code> as part of jQuery UI 1.8; however, it
        can be used independently of jQuery UI.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate the capabilities of the Widget Factory, we’ll build a simple progress bar plugin.</p>
    <p>To start, we’ll create a progress bar that just lets us set the progress once. As we can see below, this is done
        by calling <code>jQuery.widget</code> with two parameters: the name of the plugin to create and an object
        literal containing functions to support our plugin.</p>
    <p>When our plugin gets called, it will create a new plugin instance and all functions will be executed within the
        context of that instance. This is different from a standard jQuery plugin in two important ways. First, the
        context is an object, not a DOM element. Second, the context is always a single object, never a collection.</p>
    <p>A simple, stateful plugin using the jQuery UI Widget Factory:</p>
    <pre><code>$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {

    _create: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.addClass( &quot;progressbar&quot; ).text( progress );
    }

});</code></pre>
    <p>The name of the plugin must contain a namespace; in this case we’ve used the <code>nmk</code> namespace. There is
        a limitation that namespaces be exactly one level deep – that is, we can’t use a namespace like
        <code>nmk.foo</code>. We can also see that the Widget Factory has provided two properties for us.
        <code>this.element</code> is a jQuery object containing exactly one element. If our plugin is called on a jQuery
        object containing multiple elements, a separate plugin instance will be created for each element, and each
        instance will have its own <code>this.element</code>. The second property, <code>this.options</code>, is a hash
        containing key/value pairs for all of our plugin’s options. These options can be passed to our plugin as shown
        here.
    </p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> In our example we use the <code>nmk</code> namespace. The <code>ui</code> namespace is reserved
        for official jQuery UI plugins. When building your own plugins, you should create your own namespace. This makes
        it clear where the plugin came from and whether it is part of a larger collection.</p>
    <p>Passing options to a widget:</p>
    <pre><code>$( &quot;&lt;div /&gt;&quot; ).appendTo( &quot;body&quot; ).progressbar({ value: 20 });</code></pre>
    <p>When we call <code>jQuery.widget</code> it extends jQuery by adding a method to <code>jQuery.fn</code> (the same
        way we’d create a standard plugin). The name of the function it adds is based on the name you pass to
        <code>jQuery.widget</code>, without the namespace; in our case it will create
        <code>jQuery.fn.progressbar</code>. The options passed to our plugin get set in <code>this.options</code> inside
        of our plugin instance.
    </p>
    <p>As shown below, we can specify default values for any of our options. When designing your API, you should figure
        out the most common use case for your plugin so that you can set appropriate default values and make all options
        truly optional.</p>
    <p>Setting default options for a widget:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {

    // Default options.
    options: {
        value: 0
    },

    _create: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.addClass( &quot;progressbar&quot; ).text( progress );
    }

});</code></pre>
    <h3 id="adding-methods-to-a-widget">Adding Methods to a Widget</h3>
    <p>Now that we can initialize our progress bar, we’ll add the ability to perform actions by calling methods on our
        plugin instance. To define a plugin method, we just include the function in the object literal that we pass to
        <code>jQuery.widget</code>. We can also define “private” methods by prepending an underscore to the function
        name.
    </p>
    <p>Creating widget methods:</p>
    <pre><code>$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {
    options: {
        value: 0
    },

    _create: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.addClass(&quot;progressbar&quot;).text( progress );
    },

    // Create a public method.
    value: function( value ) {

        // No value passed, act as a getter.
        if ( value === undefined ) {

            return this.options.value;

        // Value passed, act as a setter.
        } else {

            this.options.value = this._constrain( value );
            var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
            this.element.text( progress );

        }

    },

    // Create a private method.
    _constrain: function( value ) {

        if ( value &gt; 100 ) {
            value = 100;
        }

        if ( value &lt; 0 ) {
            value = 0;
        }

        return value;
    }

});</code></pre>
    <p>To call a method on a plugin instance, you pass the name of the method to the jQuery plugin. If you are calling a
        method that accepts parameters, you simply pass those parameters after the method name.</p>
    <p>Calling methods on a plugin instance:</p>
    <pre><code>var bar = $( &quot;&lt;div /&gt;&quot; ).appendTo( &quot;body&quot;).progressbar({ value: 20 });

// Get the current value.
alert( bar.progressbar( &quot;value&quot; ) );

// Update the value.
bar.progressbar( &quot;value&quot;, 50 );

// Get the current value again.
alert( bar.progressbar( &quot;value&quot; ) );</code></pre>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Executing methods by passing the method name to the same jQuery function that was used to
        initialize the plugin may seem odd. This is done to prevent pollution of the jQuery namespace while maintaining
        the ability to chain method calls.</p>
    <h3 id="working-with-widget-options">Working with Widget Options</h3>
    <p>One of the methods that is automatically available to our plugin is the option method. The option method allows
        you to get and set options after initialization. This method works exactly like jQuery’s <code>.css()</code> and
        <code>.attr()</code> methods: you can pass just a name to use it as a getter, a name and value to use it as a
        single setter, or a hash of name/value pairs to set multiple values. When used as a getter, the plugin will
        return the current value of the option that corresponds to the name that was passed in. When used as a setter,
        the plugin’s <code>_setOption</code> method will be called for each option that is being set. We can specify a
        <code>_setOption</code> method in our plugin to react to option changes.
    </p>
    <p>Responding when an option is set:</p>
    <pre><code>$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {

    options: {
        value: 0
    },

    _create: function() {
        this.element.addClass( &quot;progressbar&quot; );
        this._update();
    },

    _setOption: function( key, value ) {
        this.options[ key ] = value;
        this._update();
    },

    _update: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.text( progress );
    }

});</code></pre>
    <h3 id="adding-callbacks">Adding Callbacks</h3>
    <p>One of the easiest ways to make your plugin extensible is to add callbacks so users can react when the state of
        your plugin changes. We can see below how to add a callback to our progress bar to signify when the progress has
        reached 100%. The <code>_trigger</code> method takes three parameters: the name of the callback, a native event
        object that initiated the callback, and a hash of data relevant to the event. The callback name is the only
        required parameter, but the others can be very useful for users who want to implement custom functionality on
        top of your plugin. For example, if we were building a draggable plugin, we could pass the native mousemove
        event when triggering a drag callback; this would allow users to react to the drag based on the x/y coordinates
        provided by the event object.</p>
    <p>Providing callbacks for user extension:</p>
    <pre><code>$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {

    options: {
        value: 0
    },

    _create: function() {
        this.element.addClass( &quot;progressbar&quot; );
        this._update();
    },

    _setOption: function( key, value ) {
        this.options[ key ] = value;
        this._update();
    },

    _update: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.text( progress );
        if ( this.options.value == 100 ) {
            this._trigger( &quot;complete&quot;, null, { value: 100 } );
        }
    }

});</code></pre>
    <p>Callback functions are essentially just additional options, so you can get and set them just like any other
        option. Whenever a callback is executed, a corresponding event is triggered as well. The event type is
        determined by concatenating the plugin name and the callback name. The callback and event both receive the same
        two parameters: an event object and a hash of data relevant to the event, as we’ll see below.</p>
    <p>If your plugin has functionality that you want to allow the user to prevent, the best way to support this is by
        creating cancelable callbacks. Users can cancel a callback, or its associated event, the same way they cancel
        any native event: by calling <code>event.preventDefault()</code> or using <code>return false</code>. If the user
        cancels the callback, the <code>_trigger</code> method will return false so you can implement the appropriate
        functionality within your plugin.</p>
    <p>Binding to widget events:</p>
    <pre><code>var bar = $( &quot;&lt;div /&gt;&quot; ).appendTo( &quot;body&quot; ).progressbar({

    complete: function( event, data ) {
        alert( &quot;Callbacks are great!&quot; );
    }

}).bind( &quot;progressbarcomplete&quot;, function( event, data ) {

    alert( &quot;Events bubble and support many handlers for extreme flexibility.&quot; );

    alert( &quot;The progress bar value is &quot; + data.value );

});

bar.progressbar( &quot;option&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, 100 );</code></pre>
    <h3 id="the-widget-factory-under-the-hood">The Widget Factory: Under the Hood</h3>
    <p>When you call <code>jQuery.widget</code>, it creates a constructor function for your plugin and sets the object
        literal that you pass in as the prototype for your plugin instances. All of the functionality that automatically
        gets added to your plugin comes from a base widget prototype, which is defined as
        <code>jQuery.Widget.prototype</code>. When a plugin instance is created, it is stored on the original DOM
        element using <code>jQuery.data</code>, with the plugin’s full name (the plugin’s namespace, plus a hyphen, plus
        the plugin’s name) as the key. For example the jQuery UI dialog widget uses a key of <code>"ui-dialog"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Because the plugin instance is directly linked to the DOM element, you can access the plugin instance directly
        instead of going through the exposed plugin method if you want. This will allow you to call methods directly on
        the plugin instance instead of passing method names as strings and will also give you direct access to the
        plugin’s properties.</p>
    <pre><code>var bar = $( &quot;&lt;div /&gt;&quot;)
    .appendTo( &quot;body&quot; )
    .progressbar()
    .data( &quot;nmk-progressbar&quot; );

// Call a method directly on the plugin instance.
bar.option( &quot;value&quot;, 50 );

// Access properties on the plugin instance.
alert( bar.options.value );</code></pre>
    <p>One of the biggest benefits of having a constructor and prototype for a plugin is the ease of extending the
        plugin. By adding or modifying methods on the plugin’s prototype, we can modify the behavior of all instances of
        our plugin. For example, if we wanted to add a method to our progress bar to reset the progress to 0% we could
        add this method to the prototype and it would instantly be available to be called on any plugin instance.</p>
    <pre><code>$.nmk.progressbar.prototype.reset = function() {
    this._setOption( &quot;value&quot;, 0 );
};</code></pre>
    <h3 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h3>
    <p>In some cases, it will make sense to allow users to apply and then later unapply your plugin. You can accomplish
        this via the <code>destroy</code> method. Within the <code>destroy</code> method, you should undo anything your
        plugin may have done during initialization or later use. The <code>destroy</code> method is automatically called
        if the element that your plugin instance is tied to is removed from the DOM, so this can be used for garbage
        collection as well. The default <code>destroy</code> method removes the link between the DOM element and the
        plugin instance, so it’s important to call the base function from your plugin’s <code>destroy</code> method.</p>
    <p>Adding a destroy method to a widget:</p>
    <pre><code>$.widget( &quot;nmk.progressbar&quot;, {

    options: {
        value: 0
    },

    _create: function() {
        this.element.addClass(&quot;progressbar&quot;);
        this._update();
    },

    _setOption: function( key, value ) {
        this.options[ key ] = value;
        this._update();
    },

    _update: function() {
        var progress = this.options.value + &quot;%&quot;;
        this.element.text( progress );
        if ( this.options.value === 100 ) {
            this._trigger( &quot;complete&quot;, null, { value: 100 } );
        }
    },

    destroy: function() {
        this.element
            .removeClass( &quot;progressbar&quot; )
            .text( &quot;&quot; );

        // Call the base destroy function.
        $.Widget.prototype.destroy.call( this );
    }

});</code></pre>
    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Widget Factory is only one way of creating stateful plugins. There are a few different models that can be
        used and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. The Widget Factory solves lots of common problems for
        you and can greatly improve productivity, it also greatly improves code reuse, making it a great fit for jQuery
        UI as well as many other stateful plugins.</p>
