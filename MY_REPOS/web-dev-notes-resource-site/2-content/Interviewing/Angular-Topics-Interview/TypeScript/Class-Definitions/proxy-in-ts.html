<p>Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object.</p>
<p>The proxy object has the same interface as a service, which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.</p>
