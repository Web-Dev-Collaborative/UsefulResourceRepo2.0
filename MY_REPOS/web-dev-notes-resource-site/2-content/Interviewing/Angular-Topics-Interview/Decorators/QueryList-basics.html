<h3 id="querylist">QueryList —</h3>
<p>The return type of <strong>ViewChildren</strong> is <strong>QueryList</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>QueryList</strong> is an unmodifiable list of items that Angular keeps up to date when the state of the application changes.</p>
<p>A “<strong>QueryList</strong>,”, is a live list of directive and variable bindings contained within a directive. In laymen’s terms, its a collection of references to rendered items within the DOM (Document Object Model) tree. The QueryList is an unmodifiable iterator of the current references.</p>
<p>“Unmodifiable” is not the same as “immutable.” In fact, the QueryList is a mutable data structure for which the Angular framework manages the state. This is why changes to the underlying DOM references can be observed on the same QueryList instance.</p>
<p><strong>QueryList</strong> is just a fancy name for an object that stores a list of items. What is special about this object is when the state of the application changes Angular will automatically update the object items for you.</p>
<p>The type of object that ViewChildren, ContentChildren, and QueryList provide.</p>
<p>Implements an iterable interface, therefore it can be used in both ES6 javascript for (var i of items) loops as well as in Angular templates with *ngFor=“let i of myList”.</p>
<p>Changes can be observed by subscribing to the changes Observable.</p>
<h3 id="querylist-api">QueryList API —</h3>
<h4 id="getters">Getters —</h4>
<ul>
<li>first — get the first item</li>
<li>last — get the last item</li>
<li>length — get the items length</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods">Methods —</h4>
<p>map(), filter() , find(), reduce(), forEach(), some().</p>
<p>toArray() — returns the items as javascript array</p>
<p>changes() — Changes can be observed by subscribing to the changes Observable. Any time a child element is added, removed, or moved, the query list will be updated, and the changes observable of the query list will emit a new value.</p>
<h4 id="remember">Remember —</h4>
<p><strong>The QueryList is initialized only before the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook, therefore, is available only from this point.</strong></p>
