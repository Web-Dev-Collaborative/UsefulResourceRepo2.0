<h4 id="first-a-quick-review-of-the-main-lifecycle-hooks-for-components-and-directives">First a quick review of the main lifecycle hooks for components and directives</h4>
<p><strong>constructor</strong> : It is invoked when a component or directive is created by calling new on the class.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnChanges</strong> : It is invoked whenever there is a change or update in any of the <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Input">@Input</span>()</strong> properties of the component.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnInit</strong> : It is invoked every time a given component is initialized. This hook is only once called in its lifetime after the <strong>first ngOnChanges</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>ngDoCheck</strong> : It is invoked whenever the change detector of the given component is called. This allows you to implement your own change detection algorithm for the provided component.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnDestroy</strong> : It is invoked right before the component is destroyed by Angular. You can use this hook in order to unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers for avoiding any kind of memory leaks.</p>
<h4 id="difference-between-ngonchanges-and-ngoninit">Difference between ngOnChanges and ngOnInit</h4>
<p><strong>ngOnInit()</strong> is used to execute any piece of code for <strong>ONLY ONE TIME</strong> (for eg : data fetch on load).</p>
<p><strong>ngOnChanges()</strong> will execute on every <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Input">@Input</span>()</strong> property change.</p>
<p>If you want to execute any component method, based on the <span class="citation" data-cites="Input">@Input</span>() value change, then you should write such logic inside ngOnChanges().</p>
<p><strong>So why do we need ngOnInit() when we have ngOnChanges() ?</strong></p>
<p>It is because you cannot execute one time code, on every <span class="citation" data-cites="Input">@Input</span>() property change. And you cannot use constructor as the replacement of ngOnInit() as well. Because the bindings, such as <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Input">@Input</span></strong> properties are not available within the constructor.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnChanges</strong> will be called first on the life cycle hook when there is a change to the component inputs through the parent.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnInit</strong> will be called only once on initializing the component after the first ngOnChanges called.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-ngoninit-not-the-first-lifecycle-hook">Why is ngOnInit not the first lifecycle hook?</h4>
<p><strong>ngOnInit()</strong> is called after <strong>ngOnChanges</strong>() was called the first time.</p>
<p>This ensures that initial values bound to inputs are available when ngOnInit() is called. ngOnChanges() is called after inputs were updated.</p>
