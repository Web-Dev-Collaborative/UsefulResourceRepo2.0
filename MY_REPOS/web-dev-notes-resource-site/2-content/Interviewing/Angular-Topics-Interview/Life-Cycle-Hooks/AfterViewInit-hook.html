<p><strong>AfterViewInit</strong></p>
<p>A lifecycle hook that is called after Angular has fully initialized a component’s view. Define an ngAfterViewInit() method to handle any additional initialization tasks.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">interface</span> AfterViewInit <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="at">ngAfterViewInit</span>()<span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">void</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>ngAfterViewInit()</strong></p>
<p>A callback method that is invoked immediately after Angular has completed initialization of a component’s view. It is invoked only once when the view is instantiated.</p>
<p><strong>AfterViewInit</strong> starts to make more sense if you’ve began some dynamic component loading or manual view creation in Angular.</p>
<p><strong>OnInit</strong> is called once when the component’s <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Inputs">@Inputs</span></strong> and <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Outputs">@Outputs</span> </strong>have been resolved.</p>
<p><strong>AfterViewInit</strong> is called when the component’s view has been attached. Remember that Angular compiles all to JS files, not html - the framework manages templates in code and has a rendering engine to interact with the DOM. Here, <span class="citation" data-cites="ViewChild">@ViewChild</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="ViewChildren">@ViewChildren</span> will be resolved.</p>
