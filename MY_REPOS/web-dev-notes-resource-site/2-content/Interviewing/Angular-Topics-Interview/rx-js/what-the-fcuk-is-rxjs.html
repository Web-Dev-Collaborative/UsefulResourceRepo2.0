<h3 id="what-is-rxjs">What is RxJS?</h3>
<p>There are different ways to think about RxJS depending on your background. To me, RxJs is …</p>
<p>… a utility for handling asynchronous data streams.</p>
<p>… just like functional vanilla JavaScript in many ways, but with the dimension of time added.</p>
<p>… like a Promise that can resolve over and over again.</p>
<p>I like to think of RxJS terminology in a highly simplified way.</p>
<p><strong>Observable</strong> - An array that is built over time.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong> - A for loop that happens over time.</p>
<p><strong>Emit</strong> - When an Observable spits out a value because something subscribed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong> - Functions that alter the the way Observables emit values.</p>
