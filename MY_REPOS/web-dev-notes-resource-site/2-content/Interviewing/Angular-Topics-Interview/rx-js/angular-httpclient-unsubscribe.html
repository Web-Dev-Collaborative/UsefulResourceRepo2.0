<p>Is there a need to unsubscribe from the Observable the Angular HttpClient’s methods return?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>this.http.get(url).subscribe(x =&gt; this.doSomething());</code></p>
<p>Do I need to unsubscribe from this subscription? I am asking this is because I don’t know if Angular handles it itself. Plus the request is one-off not continuously.</p>
<p>No, You don’t need to unsubscribe it. It observes until getting a response from api. And once the Http request completes it unsubscribes automatically.</p>

An HttpClient method does not begin its HTTP request until you call subscribe() on the observable returned by that method. This is true for all HttpClient methods.
