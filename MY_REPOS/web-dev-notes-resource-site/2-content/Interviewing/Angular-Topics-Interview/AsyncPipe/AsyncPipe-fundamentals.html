<p><strong><a href="https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe#asyncpipe">AsyncPipe</a></strong></p>
<p>Unwraps a value from an asynchronous primitive.</p>
<p>Description The async pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new value is emitted, the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes. When the component gets destroyed, the async pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks.</p>
<p>Normally to render the result of a promise or an observable we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>Wait for a callback.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Store the result of the callback in a variable.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Bind to that variable in the template.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>With AsyncPipe we can use promises and observables directly in our template, without having to store the result on an intermediate property or variable.</p>
<p>AsyncPipe accepts as argument an observable or a promise, calls subcribe or attaches a then handler, then waits for the asynchronous result before passing it through to the caller.</p>
