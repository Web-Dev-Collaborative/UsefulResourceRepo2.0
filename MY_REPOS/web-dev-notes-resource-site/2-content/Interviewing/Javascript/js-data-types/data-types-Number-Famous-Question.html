<h3 id="following-code-returns-false-in-javascript.-justify-why-it-happens">Following code returns <code>false</code> in JavaScript. Justify why it happens:</h3>
<p><code>0.2 + 0.1 === 0.3</code></p>
<p>Not just in JavaScript,but nearly the same for all programming language because floating point representation are not accurate but approximate.</p>
<h3 id="a-better-way-to-look-at-the-above-expression-will-be-as--">A Better way to look at the above expression will be as : -</h3>
<p>The expression you evaluated above ought to be implicitly read as “fpa(0.1) + fpa(0.2) == fpa(0.3)”, where the “fpa” function produces the floating-point approximation of a number.</p>
<h3 id="in-javascript-there-are-no-true-integers-all-numbers-are-implemented-in-double-precision-64-bit-binary-format-ieee-754.-also-called-double-precision-floats.-specifically-it-is-a-double-precision-format-meaning-that-64-bits-are-allocated-for-each-floating-point.">In JavaScript, there are no true integers, all numbers are implemented in <strong>double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754</strong>. Also called <strong>double-precision floats</strong>. Specifically it is a double-precision format, meaning that 64 bits are allocated for each floating point.</h3>
<p>Behind the scenes, a floating-point number is an integer multiplied by some exponent of the base (plus a sign, etc. and technical details that implement zero, infinity, NaN, etc.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the important takeaway is that it’s a binary representation. In binary, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 each have endless representations, just like 1/3 has the endless representation 0.333… in decimal</p>
<p>At some point, you need to cut off an endless representation, trading away accuracy for the ability to represent it in a finite space.</p>
<p>In other words, When you convert .1 or 1/10 to base 2 (binary) you get a repeating pattern after the decimal point, just like trying to represent 1/3 in base 10. The value is not exact, and therefore you can’t do exact math with it using normal floating point methods.</p>
<h3 id="further-explanation">Further Explanation</h3>
<p>The crux of the problem is that numbers are represented in this format as a whole number times a power of two; rational numbers (such as 0.1, which is 1/10) whose denominator is not a power of two cannot be exactly represented.</p>
<p>For 0.1 in the standard binary64 format, the representation can be written exactly as</p>
<pre><code>0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 in decimal, or
0x1.999999999999ap-4 in C99 hexfloat notation.
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, the rational number 0.1, which is 1/10, can be written exactly as</p>
<pre><code>0.1 in decimal, or
0x1.99999999999999...p-4
</code></pre>
<p>in an analogue of C99 hexfloat notation, where the … represents an unending sequence of 9’s.</p>
