<h3 id="explanations">Explanations</h3>
<p>Since both a and b are defined within the enclosing scope of the function, and since the line they are on begins with the var keyword, most JavaScript developers would expect typeof a and typeof b to both be undefined in the above example.</p>
<p>However, that is not the case. The issue here is that most developers incorrectly understand the statement var a = b = 3; to be shorthand for:</p>
<p><img src="assets/2020-10-08-16-59-10.png" /></p>
<p>But in fact, var a = b = 3; is actually shorthand for:</p>
<p><img src="assets/2020-10-08-16-59-22.png" /></p>
<p>As a result (if you are not using strict mode), the output of the code snippet would be:</p>
<p><img src="assets/2020-10-08-16-59-37.png" /></p>
<p>But how can b be defined outside of the scope of the enclosing function? Well, since the statement var a = b = 3; is shorthand for the statements b = 3; and var a = b;, b ends up being a global variable (since it is not preceded by the var keyword) and is therefore still in scope even outside of the enclosing function.</p>
<p>Note that, in strict mode (i.e., with use strict), the statement var a = b = 3; will generate a runtime error of ReferenceError: b is not defined, thereby avoiding any headfakes/bugs that might othewise result. (Yet another prime example of why you should use use strict as a matter of course in your code!)</p>
