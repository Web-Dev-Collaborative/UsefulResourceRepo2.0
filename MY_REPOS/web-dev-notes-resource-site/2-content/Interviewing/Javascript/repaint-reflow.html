<p>Hello and welcome to the world of little known optimization techniques. Reflow and repaint are important concepts that most developers are not exposed to.</p>
<p>Put simply, browser reflow is simply the process of re-calculating the positions of elements on a page. When you change a div’s height, or the font, or set a property using the style attribute, the browser has to recalculate in order to re-render the webpage.</p>
<p>What typically triggers reflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resizing the window</li>
<li>Changing the font</li>
<li>Changing the font size</li>
<li>Animations of DOM elements</li>
<li>Adding/removing a stylesheet</li>
<li>Calculating offsetWidth or offsetHeight</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflow is an expensive process and should be avoided. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHxbs5WEQzE">here</a> to watch an awesome video on how to minimize browser reflow.</p>
<p>So what about repaint? Repaint happens when you change the element’s apperance without any major changes. So that includes changing the color, background color, the border color or setting the <code>visibility:hidden</code>.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, repaint is less expensive than reflow.</p>
