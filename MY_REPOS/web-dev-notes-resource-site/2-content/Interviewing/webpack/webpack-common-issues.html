<h2 id="note---what-does-webpack-mean-by-xx-hidden-modules">Note - What does webpack mean by XX hidden modules</h2>
<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28858176/what-does-webpack-mean-by-xx-hidden-modules</p>
<p>Webpack hides modules coming from folders like [“node_modules”, “bower_components”, “jam”, “components”] in your console output by default. This helps you to focus on your modules instead on your dependencies.</p>
<p>You can display them by using the –display-modules argument.</p>
<p><code>$ webpack --display-modules</code></p>
<h2 id="issue---configuration.resolve-has-an-unknown-property-root.">Issue - configuration.resolve has an unknown property ‘root’.</h2>
<p>In webpack.config.js I had below under resolve…</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode .js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">  resolve<span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="dt">root</span><span class="op">:</span> __dirname<span class="op">,</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Final SOLUTION - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43107233/configuration-resolve-has-an-unknown-property-root</p>
<p>resolve.root is Webpack 1 configuration and doesn’t exist for Webpack 2.</p>
<p>For Webpack 2 you can use resolve.modules:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1">resolve<span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">    <span class="dt">modules</span><span class="op">:</span> [__dirname<span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&#39;node_modules&#39;</span>]<span class="op">,</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="issue---webpack-command-not-found---suddenly-getting-this-from-the-same-directory-from-where-it-was-working-just-fine-last-night">Issue - “webpack: command not found” - Suddenly getting this, from the same directory from where it was working just fine last night</h2>
<p>First followed this.</p>
<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38788166/webpack-command-not-working</p>
<p>“use the scripts property of your package.json to use webpack from this directory which will be exported.” So in package.json included the following in the script:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="st">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2">  <span class="st">&quot;build&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;webpack --config webpack.config.js&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>then <code>$ npm run build</code></p>
<p>But still was getting the same error.</p>
<p>Hence, from - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32550089/webpack-command-not-found-after-npm-install-webpack-g</p>
<p>Install it globally</p>
<p><code>npm i -g webpack</code></p>
<p>And now SOLVED.</p>
<h2 id="issue---cli-for-webpack-must-be-installed.-these-are-recommended-choices-also-was-getting-cannot-find-module-webpack-cli">Issue - CLI for webpack must be installed. These are recommended choices ALSO WAS GETTING “Cannot find module ’webpack-cli”</h2>
<p>Just install webpack-cli globally with <code>$ npm i -g webpack-cli</code></p>

<p>Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment: Linux 64-bit with Node.js 9.x</p>
<p>The source of the problems is most certainly, that I upgraded the node version in between.</p>
<p>Solution - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37986800/node-sass-could-not-find-a-binding-for-your-current-environment</p>
<p><code>npm rebuild node-sass</code></p>
<p>Another solution would have been -</p>
<p>Just delete the node-sass folder and run <code>npm install</code></p>

<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49203841/webpack-4-1-1-configuration-module-has-an-unknown-property-loaders</p>
<p>All I had to do was rename loaders to rules - in the webpack.config file</p>
