<h4 id="what-is-sharding-in-mongodb">What is Sharding in MongoDB?</h4>
<p>Sharding is a concept in MongoDB, which splits large data sets into small data sets across multiple MongoDB instances.</p>
<p>Sometimes the data within MongoDB will be so huge, that queries against such big data sets can cause a lot of CPU utilization on the server. To tackle this situation, MongoDB has a concept of Sharding, which is basically the splitting of data sets across multiple MongoDB instances.</p>
<p>The collection which could be large in size is actually split across multiple collections or Shards as they are called.</p>
<h4 id="logically-all-the-shards-work-as-one-collection.">Logically all the shards work as one collection.</h4>
<h4 id="how-to-implement-sharding">How to Implement Sharding</h4>
<p>Shards are implemented by using clusters which are nothing but a group of MongoDB instances.</p>
<p>The components of a Shard include</p>
<p>A Shard – This is the basic thing, and this is nothing but a MongoDB instance which holds the subset of the data. In production environments, all shards need to be part of replica sets.</p>
<p>Config server – This is a mongodb instance which holds metadata about the cluster, basically information about the various mongodb instances which will hold the shard data. A Router – This is a mongodb instance which basically is responsible to re-directing the commands send by the client to the right servers.</p>
