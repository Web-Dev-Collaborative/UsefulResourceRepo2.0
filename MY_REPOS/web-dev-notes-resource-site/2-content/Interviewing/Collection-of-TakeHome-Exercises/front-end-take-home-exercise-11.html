<h1 id="take-home-exercise-for-frontend-interviews">Take-home exercise for frontend interviews</h1>
<p>Frontend coding challenge.</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on <a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy</a>. Users visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see a list of results. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).</p>
<p>Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.</p>
<p>This project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.</li>
<li>Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.</li>
<li>Show off your animation skills!</li>
<li>Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.</li>
<li>Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.</li>
<li>Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetching… could be optimized for UX.</li>
<li>Let the user upload a GIF.</li>
<li>Add some unit tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h3>
<p>We’ve included all of the boilerplate to get started with this project using <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>, feel free to use this structure if you’d like. If you’d prefer to use something other than React or you’d prefer a different project structure, go ahead and make any changes you’d like.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>The app should run on any computer by running <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm start</code>. We’ll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Please, don’t open a PR against this repo. Just follow the direction from the recruiter on how to submit the exercise.</p>
<h3 id="coding-at-our-team">Coding at our Team</h3>
<p>We strive for writing simple, maintainable and clean code.</p>
<p>We prefer simplicity over complexity.</p>
<p>We comment our code and commit often.</p>
<p>We love our users and we really care about providing a good user experience and pleasant UI.</p>
<p>We encourage out of the box thinking and we love to be impressed!</p>
