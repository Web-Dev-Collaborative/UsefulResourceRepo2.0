<p>HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server. It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request. This self-contained design allows for the distributed nature of the Internet, where a request or response might pass through many intermediate routers and proxy servers. It also allows intermediary servers to perform value-added functions such as load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.</p>
<p>A basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint). Below are common HTTP verbs:</p>

<p>HTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-that-https">What is that HTTPS?</h2>
<p>Now you understand HTTP then what is that HTTPS? HTTPS is the secured HTTP protocol required to send and receive information securely over internet. Nowadays it is mandatory for all websites to have HTTPS protocol to have secured internet. Browsers like Google Chrome will show an alert with “Not Secure” message in the address bar if the site is not served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>Besides the security and encryption, the communication structure of HTTPS protocol remains same as HTTP protocol as explained above.</p>
