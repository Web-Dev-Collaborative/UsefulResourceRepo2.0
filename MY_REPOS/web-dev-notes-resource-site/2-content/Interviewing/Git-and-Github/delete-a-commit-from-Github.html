<h2 id="to-delete-a-commit-from-github">To delete a commit from Github</h2>
<p>I accidentally switched to the master branch..</p>
<p>And there I somehow made 2 commits, and pushed them.</p>
<p>After going back to source branch, subsequent rake gen_deploy will give this error:</p>
<p><code>failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:samwize/samwize.github.com'</code></p>
<p>I don’t really understand why.</p>
<p>But I knew I shouldn’t push the 2 commits in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-remove-the-2-commits">Steps to remove the 2 commits</h3>
<p>Firstly, find out the commit that you want to revert back to.</p>
<p><code>git log</code></p>
<p>For example, commit 7f6d03 was before the 2 wrongful commits.</p>
<p>press q to exit from <code>git log</code></p>
<p>Force push that commit as the new master:</p>
<p><code>git push origin +7f6d03:master</code></p>

<h2 id="another-way">Another way</h2>
<p>You can also use git reset to undo things. Then force push.</p>

<h3 id="git-push-origin--f">git push origin -f</h3>

<p>In first command for “<strong>sha-commit-name-to-go-back-to</strong>” - I copied-and-pasted, the the SHA Key (click on the that specific commit, and then on the right side of the page).</p>
<p>This commit was named as “second commit” and after the above 2 commands the entire commit and also another commit (named “third commit”) was deleted. Meaning, the above 2 commands will delete all commits starting from the SHA Key and any forward commit.</p>
<p>But then, when I added the correct version of the full project (by following the above 3 steps) – all the previous commit came right back.</p>
<p>Have to study in moer detail (as of 26-May-2014) to get the correct solution be able to delete a single commit only.</p>
<p>Specially Note, as per the above link, when I ran the below 2 commands</p>
<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD~2</code> and then <code>git push origin +master</code> after running the above 2, my Project got completely messed up and went back to much previous state.</p>
