<p>One of the feature git, has enabled us to record all changes by the commit. And saved it as our history. So when something unexpected happens, you can rollback to specific commits. But, too many commits may mess your git history. If you have a lot of fixup commits, and you merge all of them directly into master, the git history will be bloated (which is something we don’t want). So, if your change consists of two commits X and Y, we want to squash them into a single commit Z</p>
<p>Some folks do it by hastily creating a new branch, porting all changes to it with a patch file and creating a separate pull request. But this is headache both for the contributor and project maintainer. There’s an easier way, which is git squash</p>

<p>So before we start the process of squashing, first find out the number of commits we have made, we can inspect the total number of commits that have been made to the project with the following command:</p>
<p><code>git log</code></p>
<p>This will provide you with output that looks similar to this</p>

<p>The log shows all the commits made to the given project’s repository, so your commits will be mixed it with the commits made by others. For projects that have an extensive history of commits by multiple authors, you’ll want to specify yourself as author in the command:</p>
<p><code>git log --author=your-username</code></p>
<p>Now if you know the number of commits you’ve made on the branch (just count it) that you want to rebase, you can simply run the git rebase command like so:</p>
<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD~x</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD~8</code></p>
<p>If, however, you don’t know how many commits you have made on your branch, you’ll need to find which commit is the base of your branch, which you can do by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>git merge-base new-branch master</code></p>
<p>This command will return a long string known as a commit hash, something that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Output
66e506853b0366c87f4834bb6b39d341cd094fe9</code></pre>
<p>We’ll use this commit hash to pass to the git rebase command:</p>
<p><code>git rebase -i 66e506853b0366c87f4834bb6b39d341cd094fe9</code></p>
<p>For either of the above commands, your command-line text editor will open with a file that contains a list of all the commits in your branch, and you can now choose whether to squash commits or reword them.</p>
<h3 id="now-after-running-git-rebase--i-head8-the-follwoing-editor-will-open-in-the-terminal-and-this-is-where-i-have-to-choose-which-commit-to-squash-and-which-ones-to-pick">Now after running <code>git rebase -i HEAD~8</code> the follwoing editor will open in the Terminal and this is where I have to choose which commit to Squash and which ones to Pick</h3>
<p>When we squash commit messages, we are squashing or combining several smaller commits into one larger one.</p>
<p>In front of each commit you’ll see the word “pick,” so your file will look similar to this if you have two commits:</p>
<pre><code>GNU nano 2.0.6 File: …username/repository/.git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo

<p><strong>At this point, you can save and close the file ( Choosing the option shown in the Terminal, Control + O for writing out, then just press Enter for choosing the default file to write to and then finally Control+X to exit).

<p>Why it happened in my case was that, you cannot squash older commits onto a new commit. Here is an example say you have 3 commits:</p>
<pre><code>pick 01mn9h78 The lastest commit
pick a2b6pcfr A commit before the latest
pick 093479uf An old commit i made a while back</code></pre>
<p>Now if you say git rebase -i HEAD~3 and you do something like</p>
<pre><code>pick 01mn9h78 The lastest commit
s a2b6pcfr A commit before the latest
s 093479uf An old commit i made a while back
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in the error :</p>
<pre><code>error: cannot &#39;squash&#39; without a previous commit You can fix this with &#39;git rebase --edit-todo&#39; and then run &#39;git rebase --continue&#39;. Or you can abort the rebase with &#39;git rebase --abort&#39;.</code></pre>

<p><strong>Once you perform a rebase, the history of your branch changes, and you are no longer able to use the git push command because the direct path has been modified.</strong></p>
<p>And you can check that by doing a <code>git status</code> You will get</p>
<pre><code>Your branch and &#39;origin/master&#39; have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)

nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
<p>We will have to instead use the –force or -f flag to force-push the changes, informing Git that you are fully aware of what you are pushing.</p>
<p>At this point, we should ensure that we are on the correct branch by checking out the branch we are working on:</p>
<p><code>git checkout new-branch</code></p>
<pre><code>Output
Already on &#39;new-branch&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can perform the force-push:</p>
<p><code>git push -f</code></p>
<p>I could also do below, assuming I am in master branch, and all my squashing activities were in master branch</p>
<p><code>git push origin master --force</code></p>
<p>And now if I go to the exiting PR in Github, I will see the same PR has got fully updated with my latest changes, with just a single commit.</p>
<p>Note, all these squashing activities could have been done by the Repo’s Manager as well. The repository’s manager can squash all the commits in a pull request into a single commit by selecting “Squash and merge” on a pull request.</p>

<h4 id="solution---the-below-will-save-you-many-times">Solution - (the below will save you many times)</h4>
<p>The easiest way to squash all of these changes is probably start by resetting your current branch back to the upstream master branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset upstream/master
</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-magical-thing-abuout-the-above-command-is-this-will-reset-the-repository-but-not-your-working-directory-to-the-state-of-the-upstreammaster-branch.-since-it-doesnt-modify-the-state-of-your-working-directory-this-means-that-all-your-changes-are-preserved-but-not-the-commit-history.-at-this-point-we-see">The magical thing abuout the above command is, this will reset the repository, but not your working directory, to the state of the upstream/master branch.

<pre><code>\$ git status
[...]
Changes not staged for commit:
(use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
(use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   app/server.go
    modified:   smtp.go

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)

<p>Now we can create a new commit:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add -u
$ git commit</code></pre>

You would then force push this to your own master branch, which would update the PR.</h4>
<p>(NB: if you’re worried about screwing something up or losing your changes or anything like that, either work on a new branch, or just make a local copy of your working directory and work on that instead.)</p>
