<h1 id="my-cheat-sheet-of-compact-steps">My cheat-sheet of compact Steps</h1>
<p>The very first step is - Fork the project by clicking on the Fork icon withing Github &gt;&gt; git clone that fork only after that project shows up under my forked projects. And then do normal</p>
<h2 id="git-clone-repo-.git">$ git clone &lt;repo .git &gt;</h2>
<p>Now from the git cloned project’s root directory, create a new branch on which I shall work locally</p>
<h2 id="git-checkout--b">$ git checkout -b <new_topic-branch-name></h2>
<p>So, as an actual example on 5-March-2018 I ran</p>
<h2 id="git-checkout--b-storybook-react-ui-component-too">$ git checkout -b storybook-react-UI-component-too</h2>
<p>You should also make sure that your branch name is a descriptive one. Rather than calling it my-branch, you should go with frontend-hook-migration or fix-documentation-typos instead.</p>
<p>Terminal will say - <code>‘Switched to a new branch 'new_topic-branch-name'</code></p>
<p>Work in the local machine for my modification. Once you have modified existing files or added new files to the project, you can add them to your local repository</p>
<h2 id="git-add--a">git add -A</h2>
<h2 id="git-commit--m-adding-storybook-a-development-environment-for-ui-components">git commit -m “adding storybook, a development environment for UI components”</h2>
<p>Terminal will say something like below</p>
<p>[storybook-react-UI-component-too 6fcf716] adding storybook, a development environment for UI components 1 file chang</p>
<h2 id="git-status">git status</h2>
<p>It may say something on the line -</p>
<p>On branch storybook-react-UI-component-too nothing to commit, working directory clean</p>
<h2 id="git-push-origin-storybook-react-ui-component-too">git push origin storybook-react-UI-component-too</h2>
<p>i.e. the format is -</p>
<h2 id="git-push-origin">git push origin <new_topic-branch-name-which-I-created-above-and-with-which-I-worked-above></h2>
<ol start="6" type="A">
<li>Then in the browser navigate to the original URL of the Original repo.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the very landing page of the repo I will see my own commits. And click on <code>“Compare &amp; pull r­equest”</code> .. Actually that option will be only one, where I can do something, after submitting that commit.</p>
<ol start="7" type="A">
<li>Then in the next page, just put any comments that I may like to put, and , click on “Create Pull Request”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thats it..</p>

<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9790448/how-to-update-a-pull-request-from-forked-repo</p>
<p>The case is as below and often repeated - So I first forked a repo and then made a commit to that forked repo. I then opened a pull request. The pull request listed all the changes I wanted.</p>
<p>After reviewing my pull request, there were a number of changes that the repo owner wanted me to make before he accepted it. I have made those changes in my fork, now how do I update the pull request with those changes</p>
<p>Ans is, basically I have to do nothing – just make changes of the forked repo, in that branch from which I sent the PR ( e.g. master ), i.e. just do a regular commit in your own local repo in local machine. Push this relevant branch of your fork to Github.</p>
<p>And thats it, the PR will reflect this changes immediately.</p>
