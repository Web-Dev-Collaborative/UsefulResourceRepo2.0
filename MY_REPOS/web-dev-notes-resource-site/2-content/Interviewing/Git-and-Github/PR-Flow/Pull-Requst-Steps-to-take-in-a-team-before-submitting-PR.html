<p>First the regular steps, i.e. working on the fork and merging the dev-branch of the fork with master of the fork</p>
<p>A&gt; Fork the repo from the upstream remote repo to my personal github</p>
<p>B&gt; Create a Branch in the forked repository (This is Optional)</p>
<p>C&gt; Work on that branch, and at the end merge it with the Master Branch (in the forked repo itself, i.e if I have actually worked on a separate Branch )</p>
<p>Lets say my Upstream Repo name is institutions-web under the Organization name of MyOrganization.</p>
<p>Fork the repo from MyOrganization to my personal github &gt; then clone the repo into local machine to work locally &gt; after development-work is done in my locally cloned repo from the root of the project.</p>
<p>Then run following command</p>
<p><code>$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:MyOrganization/institutions-web.git</code></p>
<p>i.e. the very first time before running &lt; git fetch &gt;</p>
<p>The above step configures a git remote for a fork. This step is ONLY required ONCE per repository, which is Add a new remote upstream repository to sync with the fork.</p>

<p>You will probably find things more manageable if you work on a feature branch rather than your own master branch. That is, start with git checkout -b my-feature before you start making any changes. If you will be regularly contributing upstream, your life is easiest if your master branch always reflects the state of the upstream master branch at some point in time, because this permits you to update your local master branch with a simple</p>
<p><code>git pull upstream master</code></p>
<p>Avoiding merging code into your feature branches. Regularly rebase on upstream/master if you need to incorporate upstream changes.</p>
