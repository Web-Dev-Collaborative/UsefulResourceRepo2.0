<h3 id="section">******************************************************************</h3>
<h2 id="step-1">STEP 1</h2>
<p>I make sure I am in the master branch of my team’s shared repository &amp; that I have the LATEST VERSION:</p>
<p><code>git pull origin master</code></p>
<h2 id="step-2">STEP 2</h2>
<p>I make my very own branch.</p>
<p>I name it a name with no spaces, like: “mybranchname”.</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b mybranchname</code></p>
<p>Now I am in my branch, not the master, so it is safe to make changes.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">STEP 3</h2>
<p>I keep code away in my code editor, tappity-tap-tap.</p>
<h2 id="step-4">STEP 4</h2>
<p>I add my changes:</p>
<p><code>git add .</code> OR <code>git add insert-file-name-here</code></p>
<p>Then I commit the changes:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m 'my awesome improvements to app'</code></p>
<h3 id="stop-right-there-my-teammates-have-been-making-changes-to-the-master.-i-should-refresh-it-before-i-push-my-changes-to-make-the-pull-request.-so-i-get-the-master-branch-with-all-the-latest-changes.">STOP RIGHT THERE: my teammates have been making changes to the master. I should refresh it before I push my changes to make the pull request. So I get the master branch with all the latest changes.</h3>
<h2 id="step-5">STEP 5</h2>
<p>I switch to master for a sec:</p>
<p><code>git checkout master</code></p>
<p>I refresh the master branch:</p>
<p><code>git pull origin master</code></p>
<h2 id="step-6">STEP 6</h2>
<p>I switch back into my branch:</p>
<p><code>git checkout mybranchname</code></p>
<h2 id="step-7">STEP 7</h2>
<p>Then I push my changes TO MY OWN BRANCH AND NOT TO THE MASTER (essentially, you are pushing to the remote version of your branch):</p>
<p><code>git push origin mybranchname</code></p>
<h2 id="step-8">STEP 8</h2>
<p>I go over to github.com</p>
<p>Once there, I see in our shared repo, a 1 (or any number of requests) under “Pull Requests”, so I click to go to that page.</p>
<h2 id="step-9">STEP 9</h2>
<p>I click on my pull request to open it up, and then I click the green confirmation button, and click again, until I have satisfied all of the options to confirm the merge. If there are conflicts, I resolve them before confirming everything.</p>
<h2 id="step-10">STEP 10</h2>
<p>No more green, you will now get an alert that is purple, telling you the merge is complete. It will ask you to delete the branch. Go ahead and do that.</p>
<h2 id="step-11">STEP 11</h2>
<p>In my terminal (or git bash for PC,) I switch to my master branch</p>
<p><code>git checkout master</code></p>
<h2 id="step-12">STEP 12</h2>
<p>I refresh my master branch using git pull origin master, to make sure I am up to date with my changes and also with any other changes that people made.</p>
<h2 id="step-13">STEP 13</h2>
<p>In terminal, I delete the local version of the branch I SUCCESSFULLY merged &amp; then deleted before, when I was on github.com.</p>
<p><code>git branch -d mybranchname</code></p>
<h2 id="step-14">STEP 14</h2>
<p>I want to make a new branch (it is recommended to name your branches after a feature you are working on, so you can delete superfluous branches as you go. Start this cycle all over again from STEP 1.</p>
