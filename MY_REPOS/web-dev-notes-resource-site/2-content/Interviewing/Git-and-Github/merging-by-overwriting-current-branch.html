<p>I have two branches, <strong>old-branch</strong> and <strong>new-dev-branch</strong>. <strong>new-dev-branch</strong> is the latest one and I no more need the <strong>old-branch</strong> changes in <strong>new-dev-branch</strong> branch, yet I don’t want to delete them.</p>
<p>So I just want to dump all the contents of <strong>new-dev-branch</strong> into <strong>old-branch</strong> so that they both point to the same commit. Here’s the commands.</p>
<h4 id="git-checkout-old-branch">$ git checkout old-branch</h4>
<h4 id="git-tag-old-email-branch-this-is-optional">$ git tag old-email-branch # This is optional</h4>
<h4 id="git-reset-hard-new-dev-branch">$ git reset –hard new-dev-branch</h4>

<p>This will merge in the way that target branch would include only its own commits + merge commit and not include the commits from the second branch</p>

<p>This is also useful, when I myself want to merge the commits from a dev branch to the master branch in the local machine itself, before pushing to the remote repo</p>
<p>I create a separate “dev” branch and make all intermediate commits.</p>
<p>Once the code is in good state, make a merge to master. So the master wouldn’t contain “intermediate” commits but only “normal” commits.</p>
<p>Delete the “dev” branch with all intermediate commits.</p>
