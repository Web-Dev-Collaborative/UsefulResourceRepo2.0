<h3 id="to-delete-the-local-git-branch-we-can-try-one-of-the-following-commands">To delete the local GIT branch we can try one of the following commands:</h3>
<pre><code>git branch -d branch_name
git branch -D branch_name</code></pre>
<p>as you can see above, we have 2 different argument, one with ‘d’ and one with ‘D’.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> option stands for –delete, which would delete the local branch, only if you have already pushed and merged it with your remote branches.</p>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> option stands for –delete –force, which deletes the branch regardless of its push and merge status, so be careful using this one!</p>
