<h3 id="definition">Definition:</h3>
<p>Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it’s a standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how long it runs for given an input.</p>
<h4 id="complexities">Complexities</h4>
<p>The following are the Asymptotic rates of growth from best to worst: - constant growth - <code>O(1)</code> Runtime is constant and does not grow with <code>n</code> - logarithmic growth – <code>O(log n)</code> Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to <code>n</code> - linear growth – <code>O(n)</code> Runtime grows directly in proportion to <code>n</code> - superlinear growth – <code>O(n log n)</code> Runtime grows in proportion <em>and</em> logarithmically to <code>n</code> - polynomial growth – <code>O(n^c)</code> Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on <code>n</code> - exponential growth – <code>O(c^n)</code> Runtime grows even faster than polynomial growth based on <code>n</code> - factorial growth – <code>O(n!)</code> Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even small values of <code>n</code></p>

<h4 id="big-o-notation">Big-O notation</h4>
<p>Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be worse. #### Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better. #### Big-θ (Big-Theta) notation Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given complexity, such as <code>n log n</code>.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations</li>
<li>Big-O does <em>not</em> mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does <em>not</em> mean average case, and Big-Omega does <em>not</em> mean Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm’s performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.</li>
<li>Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.</li>
<li>Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.</li>
<li>Big-O isn’t everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort, but in practice quick sort is superior.</li>

<h3 id="breadth-first-search"><a id="breadth-first-search"></a>Breadth First Search</h3>
<h4 id="definition-8">Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.
<ul>
<li>It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right.</li>
<li>While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.</li>
<li>When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.</li>
<li>The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it’s level).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know-8">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.</li>
<li>Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
<ul>
<li>Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than <strong>depth first search</strong>.</li>
<li>The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-complexity-4">Time Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Search: Breadth First Search: O(V + E)</li>
<li>E is number of edges</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="depth-first-search"><a id="depth-first-search"></a>Depth First Search</h3>
<h4 id="definition-9">Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.
<ul>
<li>It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.</li>
<li>Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.</li>
<li>When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it’s children until it reaches the bottom.</li>
<li>The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it’s ancestors).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know-9">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.</li>
<li>Uses a stack to push nodes onto.
<ul>
<li>Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.</li>
<li>Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-complexity-5">Time Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)</li>
<li>E is number of edges</li>
<li>V is number of vertices</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="breadth-first-search-vs.-depth-first-search">Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First Search</h4>
<ul>
<li>The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.
<ul>
<li>For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search</li>
<li>For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nuances">Nuances</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won’t have to worry about this.)</li>
<li>If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See <a href="http://xkcd.com/761/">xkcd</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.</li>
<li>Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm.</li>

<h1 id="asymptotic-notation-1"><a id="asymptotic-notation"></a>Asymptotic Notation</h1>
<h3 id="definition-14">Definition:</h3>
<p>Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it’s a standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how long it runs for given an input.</p>
<h4 id="complexities-1">Complexities</h4>
<p>The following are the Asymptotic rates of growth from best to worst: - constant growth - <code>O(1)</code> Runtime is constant and does not grow with <code>n</code> - logarithmic growth – <code>O(log n)</code> Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to <code>n</code> - linear growth – <code>O(n)</code> Runtime grows directly in proportion to <code>n</code> - superlinear growth – <code>O(n log n)</code> Runtime grows in proportion <em>and</em> logarithmically to <code>n</code> - polynomial growth – <code>O(n^c)</code> Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on <code>n</code> - exponential growth – <code>O(c^n)</code> Runtime grows even faster than polynomial growth based on <code>n</code> - factorial growth – <code>O(n!)</code> Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even small values of <code>n</code></p>

<h4 id="big-o-notation-1">Big-O notation</h4>
<p>Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be worse. #### Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better. #### Big-θ (Big-Theta) notation Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given complexity, such as <code>n log n</code>.</p>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know-14">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations</li>
<li>Big-O does <em>not</em> mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does <em>not</em> mean average case, and Big-Omega does <em>not</em> mean Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm’s performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.</li>
<li>Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.</li>
<li>Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.</li>
<li>Big-O isn’t everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort, but in practice quick sort is superior.</li>

<h3 id="breadth-first-search-1"><a id="breadth-first-search"></a>Breadth First Search</h3>
<h4 id="definition-22">Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.
<ul>
<li>It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right.</li>
<li>While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.</li>
<li>When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.</li>
<li>The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it’s level).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.</li>
<li>Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
<ul>
<li>Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than <strong>depth first search</strong>.</li>
<li>The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-complexity-14">Time Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Search: Breadth First Search: O(V + E)</li>

<h3 id="depth-first-search-1"><a id="depth-first-search"></a>Depth First Search</h3>
<h4 id="definition-23">Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.
<ul>
<li>It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.</li>
<li>Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.</li>
<li>When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it’s children until it reaches the bottom.</li>
<li>The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it’s ancestors).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-you-need-to-know-23">What you need to know</h4>
<ul>
<li>Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.</li>
<li>Uses a stack to push nodes onto.
<ul>
<li>Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.</li>
<li>Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-complexity-15">Time Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)</li>
<li>E is number of edges</li>
<li>V is number of vertices</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="breadth-first-search-vs.-depth-first-search-1">Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First Search</h4>
<ul>
<li>The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.
<ul>
<li>For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search</li>
<li>For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nuances-1">Nuances</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won’t have to worry about this.)</li>
<li>If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See <a href="http://xkcd.com/761/">xkcd</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.</li>
