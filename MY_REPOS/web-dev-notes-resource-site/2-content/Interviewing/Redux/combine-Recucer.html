<p>Redux ships with a combineReducers() helper function, useful for “splitting” the root reducer into separate functions that each manage one branch of the state tree.</p>
<p>As your app grows more complex, you’ll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.</p>
<p>The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.</p>
<p>The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()</p>
