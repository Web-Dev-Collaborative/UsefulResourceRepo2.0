<p><strong>localStorage</strong> and <strong>sessionStorage</strong> both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended “non-persistence” of sessionStorage.</p>
<p><strong>That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.</strong></p>
<p>For sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in the that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">From Official Dox</a></p>
<p>The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>sessionStorage</strong> maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that’s available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</p>
<p><strong>localStorage</strong> does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</p>
<p>These mechanisms are available via the <strong>Window.sessionStorage</strong> and <strong>Window.localStorage</strong> properties (to be more precise, in supporting browsers the Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects, which the localStorage and sessionStorage properties hang off) — invoking one of these will create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed. A different Storage object is used for the sessionStorage and localStorage for each origin — they function and are controlled separately.</p>
<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.</p>

Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage. The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.</h4>
<h3 id="localstorage---some-more-details">LocalStorage - Some more details</h3>
<h5 id="advantage-of-localstorage--">Advantage of localStorage -</h5>
<p>1&gt; Storage limit is the maximum amongst the three</p>
<p>2&gt; One of the most important differences is that unlike with cookies, data does not have to be sent back and forth with every HTTP request. This reduces the overall traffic between the client and the server and the amount of wasted bandwidth. This is because data is stored on the user’s local disk and is not destroyed or cleared by the loss of an internet connection.</p>
<h5 id="disadvantage-of-localstorage--">Disadvantage of localStorage -</h5>
<p>1&gt; LocalStorage becomes slower as more data is stored4. For most browsers the time it takes for localStorage.getItem to return increases from a few milliseconds with a near empty storage to over a second with a full storage.</p>
<p>2&gt; It works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.</p>
<p>3&gt; Any JavaScript code on your page can access local storage: it has no data protection whatsoever. This is the big one for security reasons</p>
<h3 id="sessionstorage---some-more-details">SessionStorage - Some more details</h3>
<p>1&gt;</p>
<h5 id="advantage-of-sessionstorage--">Advantage of sessionStorage -</h5>
<h5 id="disadvantage-of-sessionstorage--">Disadvantage of sessionStorage -</h5>
<p>1&gt; The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.</p>
<p>2&gt; Like localStorage, it works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.</p>

<p>The maximum storage available is different per browser, but most browsers have implemented at least the w3c recommended maximum storage limit of 5MB.</p>

<p>QuotaExceededError: When storage limits exceeds on this function window.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);, it throws a “QuotaExceededError” DOMException exception if the new value couldn’t be set. (Setting could fail if, e.g., the user has disabled storage for the site, or if the quota has been exceeded.)</p>

<p>CHROME:-Privacy and security « Content settings « Cookies « Block third-party cookies. StorageEvent « The storage event is fired on a document’s Window object when a storage area changes. When a user agent is to send a storage notification for a Document, the user agent must queue a task to fire an event named storage at the Document object’s Window object, using StorageEvent.</p>
<h3 id="cookie">Cookie</h3>
<p>Compared to others, there’s no advantages of Cookies</p>
<p>Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side (normally from server-side).</p>
<p>Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side. Cookies Size must be less than 4KB. Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie</p>
