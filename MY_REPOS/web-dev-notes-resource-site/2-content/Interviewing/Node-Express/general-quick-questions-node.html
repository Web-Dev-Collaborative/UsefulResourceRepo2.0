<h2 id="name-ways-to-manage-events-in-an-asynchronous-way">Name ways to manage events in an asynchronous way?</h2>
<p><strong>Ans:</strong> First, a classic use of callback methods. Second, using Promises. Finally, in a more sophisticated way, we can use reactive extensions (RxJS) to define pipelines the manage events asynchronously</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-listen-on-port-80-with-node">How can you listen on port 80 with Node?</h2>
<p>Trick question! You should not try to listen with Node on port 80 (in Unix-like systems) - to do so you would need superuser rights, but it is not a good idea to run your application with it.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to have your Node.js application listen on port 80, here is what you can do. Run the application on any port above 1024, then put a reverse proxy like nginx in front of it.</p>
<h2 id="why-npm-shrinkwrap-is-useful">Why npm shrinkwrap is useful?</h2>
<p>This command locks down the versions of a package’s dependencies so that you can control exactly which versions of each dependency will be used when your package is installed. - npmjs.com</p>
<p>It is useful when you are deploying your Node.js applications - with it you can be sure which versions of your dependencies are going to be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-stub-name-a-use-case.">What’s a stub? Name a use case.</h2>
<p>Stubs are functions/programs that simulate the behaviours of components/modules. Stubs provide canned answers to function calls made during test cases. Also, you can assert on with what these stubs were called.</p>
<p>A use-case can be a file read, when you do not want to read an actual file:</p>
