<p>Since version 6.3, Node.js provides a built-in DevTools-based debugger which mostly deprecates Node Inspector, see e.g. this blog post to get started. The built-in debugger is developed directly by the V8/Chromium team and provides certain advanced features (e.g. long/async stack traces) that are too difficult to implement in Node Inspector.</p>

<p>2&gt; Break on the first statement of the script with –inspect-brk</p>
<p><code>node --inspect-brk index.js</code></p>
<p>3&gt; In chrome open <code>about:inspect</code> and it will take me to - <code>chrome://inspect/#devices</code></p>
<p>where I will see under Remote Target and a link for inspect &gt; click on that link and the debugging server will open in the below link</p>
<p>4&gt; Now chrome dev-tool will show my the actual source code file, that I am debugging - index.js in this case.</p>
<p>5&gt; Now in that source code file, put a breakmark on the desired line - so I put a breakpoint on below line</p>
<p><code>const app = express(); // creating an instance of express library</code></p>
<p>The source file is - /home/paul/codes-Lap/Node/twitter-clone/server.js</p>
<p>Then If I straightaway click on “Step Into Next function” icon &gt; it will NOT execute as in Chrome-Dev-Tool the selected line will be top most line of the file by default. So, I have to run it once, by clicking “Resume script Execution” Green button. Then the selection line will come to where I have put the breakpoint.</p>
<p>And then, click on “Step Into Next function” icon and dev-tool will take me to the source code in</p>
<p>../node_modules/express/lib/application.js file where the express() will have been defined for my above line const app = express()</p>

<p>From the source directory of the myscript.js file &gt; run $ node –inspect-brk myscript.js</p>
<p>Will output in terminal</p>
<pre><code>Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/d3e41f99-727b-4d71-8bf7-5b52d63d08dd
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
Debugger attached.</code></pre>
<p>And on 8-May-2018 &gt; Just with the above command, I got the final debug screen that I needed open up automatically (chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?experiments=true&amp;v8only=true&amp;ws=localhost:9229/d3e41f99-727b-4d71-8bf7-5b52d63d08dd)</p>
<p>But if the above screen does not open automatically then &gt; In chrome open about:inspect and it will take me to - chrome://inspect/#devices</p>
<p>where I will see under Remote Target and a link for inspect &gt; click on that link and the debugging server will open in the below link</p>
<p>chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?experiments=true&amp;v8only=true&amp;ws=localhost:9229/d3e41f99-727b-4d71-8bf7-5b52d63d08dd</p>
<p>Note that the port no is just the same as was given in the terminal.</p>
<p>Click on the link for “Open dedicated Dev-Tools for Node” in chrome://inspect/#devices &gt;&gt; And it will open the Chrome-dev-tool</p>
