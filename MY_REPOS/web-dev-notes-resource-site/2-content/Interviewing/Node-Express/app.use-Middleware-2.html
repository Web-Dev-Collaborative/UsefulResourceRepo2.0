<p>express.static() is a function that takes a path, and returns a middleware that serves all files in that path to / .</p>
<p>(If you wanted to prefix it with /public or whatever, you’d write</p>
<h2 id="app.usepublic-express.staticpath.join__dirname-public">app.use(‘/public’, express.static(path.join(__dirname, ‘public’)))</h2>

<p>The method app.use() is a function inherited from the Connect framework, which is the framework Express is written on. The method attaches a middleware function to the application stack, which runs every time Express receives a request.</p>
<p>The code you showed mounts a static server to the path / that reads from the directory the script is executing from:</p>
<p>app.use(‘/’, express.static(__dirname));</p>
<p>If you were to change the path to /path, then the static file server will serve static files from that path instead. If you specify no path, then / is used by default.</p>
