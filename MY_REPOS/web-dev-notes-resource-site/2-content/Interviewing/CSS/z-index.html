<p><strong>The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. As in, which one appears as if it is physically closer to you. z-index only affects elements that have a position value other than static (the default).</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-z-index-may-not-give-expected-results-sometimes">Why z-index may not give expected results sometimes</h3>
<p>The element doesnâ€™t have its position set One of the other guidelines that determine stacking order is if an element has its position set or not.</p>
<p>To set position for an element, add the CSS position property to anything other than static, like relative or absolute. (You can read more about it in this article that I wrote.)</p>
<p>According to this rule, positioned elements will display on top of unpositioned elements.</p>
