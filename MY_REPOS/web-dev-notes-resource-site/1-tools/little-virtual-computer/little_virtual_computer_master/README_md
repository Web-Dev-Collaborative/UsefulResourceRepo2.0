# Little Virtual Computer

Have you ever wanted to know how a computer works? How the software is
understood by the computer at a hardware level?

Let's build a simulated computer in Javascript (because JS seems to be the Lingua
Franca of code nowadays), to see at how it all fits together.

You can [try out the simulated computer](https://jsdf.github.io/little-virtual-computer/computer1) and then [read the entire source in one single Javascript file](computer1.js)

Then [read this](binary-and-hexadecimal.md) you want to know more about binary
and hexadecimal numbers (not required to understand the simulated computer, but
useful to understand how real computers work).
