  "description": "> Today I discovered jsDeliver, a service that let's you turn any GitHub repository into a CDN. Here's how it works.  The base URL is <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repo}/>, where you replace {username} with the GitHub username and {repo} with the repository name for the project. Append that URL with the path to the file you want to access in the project.",
