    <p>
      The Express project is part of the OpenJS Foundation which operates
      transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals,
      timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to
      outsiders.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-1-scope">Section 1: Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Express is a http web server framework with a simple and expressive API
      which is highly aligned with Node.js core. We aim to be the best in class
      for writing performant, spec compliant, and powerful web servers in
      Node.js. As one of the oldest and most popular web frameworks in the
      ecosystem, we have an important place for new users and experts alike.
    </p>
    <h3 id="in-scope">1.1: In-scope</h3>
    <p>Express is made of many modules spread between three GitHub Orgs:</p>

      Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Technical leadership for the projects within the OpenJS Foundation is
      delegated to the projects through their project charters by the OpenJS
      Cross Project Council (CPC). In the case of the Express project, it is
      delegated to the Express Technical Committee (“TC”).
    </p>
    <p>
      This Technical Committee is in charge of both the day-to-day operations of
      the project, as well as its technical management. This charter can be
      amended by the TC requiring at least two approvals and a minimum two week
      comment period for other TC members or CPC members to object. Any changes
      the CPC wishes to propose will be considered a priority but will follow
      the same process.

      Section 3: Express Governing Body
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Express project is managed by the Technical Committee (“TC”). Members
      can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate another
      committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking process
      to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not
      participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members
      are expected to resign.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-4-roles-responsibilities">
      Section 4: Roles &amp; Responsibilities
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Express TC manages all aspects of both the technical and community
      parts of the project. Members of the TC should attend the regular meetings
      when possible, and be available for discussion of time sensitive or
      important issues.

      Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Express TC uses a “consensus seeking” process for issues that are
      escalated to the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open
      objections among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no
      objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is also expected that
      the majority of decisions made by the TC are via a consensus seeking
      process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions
      on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a
      meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its agenda during that
      meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the
      committers.
