      The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will
      send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in

      When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
      to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
      process, involving the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.</li>
      <li>Audit code to find any potential similar problems.</li>
      <li>
        Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will
        be released as fast as possible to npm.
      </li>
    </ul>
