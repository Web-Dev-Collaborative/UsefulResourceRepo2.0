    </p>
    <h2 id="prs-and-code-contributions">PRs and Code contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tests must pass.</li>
      <li>
        Follow the
        <a href="http://standardjs.com/">JavaScript Standard Style</a> and
        <code>npm run lint</code>.
      </li>
      <li>If you fix a bug, add a test.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
    <p>
      Use the <code>master</code> branch for bug fixes or minor work that is
      intended for the current release stream.

    <h2 id="steps-for-contributing">Steps for contributing</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/new"
          >Create an issue</a
        >
        for the bug you want to fix or the feature that you want to add.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create your own
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">fork</a> on GitHub, then
        checkout your fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write your code in your local copy. It’s good practice to create a
        branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
      </li>
      <li>
        To run the test suite, first install the dependencies by running
        <code>npm install</code>, then run <code>npm test</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure your code is linted by running <code>npm run lint</code> – fix
        any issue you see listed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the tests pass, you can commit your changes to your fork and then
        create a pull request from there. Make sure to reference your issue from
        the pull request comments by including the issue number
        e.g. <code>#123</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
