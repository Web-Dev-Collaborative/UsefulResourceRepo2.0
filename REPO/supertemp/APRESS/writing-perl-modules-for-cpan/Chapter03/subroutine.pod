=item @msgs  = check_mail($imap_server, $username, $password, $mailbox)

This routine checks for new mail on a IMAP server.  It takes three required
arguments - the server address (name or IP), the user name and the
password.  The fourth, optional, argument is the mailbox name and
which will default to "INBOX" if not set.  If an error is encountered -1 is
returned and an error message is printed to STDERR.  If successful, a list of
new message IDs is returned that can be used with retrieve_mail().  An empty 
list indicates no new messages.
