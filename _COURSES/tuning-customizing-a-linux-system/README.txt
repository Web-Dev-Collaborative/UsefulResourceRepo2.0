Welcome to the source code for Tuning and Customizing a Linux System!

In this file, you'll find all the configuration files and shell scripts
discussed in the book.  They're organized by Chapter, so you shouldn't
have any trouble finding what you're looking for, but here's an index, anyway.

Directory:	Files:			Intended Destination:
**********	******			*********************
Chapter08/
		Listing-8-1.sh		/etc/init.d/sshd

Chapter10/
		Listing-10-1.txt	/etc/socks.conf

Chapter12/
		Listing-12-1.txt	/etc/xinetd.d/cvs

Chapter13/
		Listing-13-1.sh		/etc/profile.d/java.sh
		Listing-13-1.csh	/etc/profile.d/java.csh

Chapter15/
		Listing-15-1.sh		/etc/profile.d/java.sh
		Listing-15-1.csh	/etc/profile.d/java.csh
		Listing-15-2.sh		/usr/local/java

Chapter16/
		Listing-16-1.sh		/etc/init.d/firewall
		Listing-16-2.sh		/etc/sysconfig/firewall
		Listing-16-3.txt	/etc/dhcpd.conf
		Listing-16-4.txt	/etc/named.conf


Here are some comments:
- Listing-13-1.sh is actually what appears in the book as Listing 13-1;
  Listing-13-1.csh, meanwhile, is the same file in csh syntax for your
  convenience.

- Listing-15-1.sh is an updated version of Listing-13-1.sh for the material
  in Chapter 15. (Listing-15-1.csh is the same file in csh syntax.)


That's it!  Thanks for reading!
