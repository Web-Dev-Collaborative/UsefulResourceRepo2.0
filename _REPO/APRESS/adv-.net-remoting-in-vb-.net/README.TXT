Source code samples for "Advanced .NET Remoting" by Ingo Rammer.
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this directories subfolders, you'll find the source code samples sorted by chapter. Most samples will be runnable by either opening the Visual Studio.NET solution files (*.SLN) or by directly starting the compiled samples from the bin\debug subdirectories.

Only some samples have to be hosted in Internet Information Server (IIS) - in this case you'll find a README.TXT in the relevant subdirectory. These files contain the necessary information on how to create and configure the virtual directories in IIS. Please also check with the information from the book.

=========
IMPORTANT
=========
As the default setting of the .NET Framework prohibits the usage of Remoting from so called "restricted code" you have to copy all samples to your local PC's harddrive. Running them from a mapped network share instead is only possible if you change the security permissions for this drive.
