Thankyou for purchasing .NET Development for Java Programmers. 

All of the source code used in the book is enclosed here. Please do not hesitate to report any errors or omissions.

Almost all code is provided as part of a chapter specific Visual Studio .NET solution. 
The only code which must be compiled from the command line are two examples from chapter 1 and chapter 6.

Special considerations are necessary for the code from the following chapters:

Chapters  5, 6, 8 and 11 - Some projects are web projects and need IIS virtual roots defined.

Chapter 6 - The database tables need to be created as described in the book before these examples can be run.

Chapter 12 - Need to create message queues and update references.

Chapter 13 - Remember to adjust the paths in the DirectoryEntry instances to refer to your system(s) before attempting to run the examples.

Chapter 16 - Microsoft has released Visual J# since this chapter was written. HelloWorldExample was re-created using the release version of J#.
