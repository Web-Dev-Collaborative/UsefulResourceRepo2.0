## How to connect to the Tierion Hash API with Python.



Tierion makes it easy to create applications that record any data or business process in the blockchain. Tierionâ€™s Hash API lets you anchor data to the blockchain while keeping your data private. Use of the Hash API is free up to 3 records per second or 1,000 records per hour.

In this guide we will be using Python 2.7

### Import Libaries

```
import requests
import hashlib
```


## Authentication

Tierion's Hash API uses a JSON Web Token as an access token for authentication. Every request must include a valid access token.

##### To obtain your access token, submit your Tierion credentials to the token endpoint.

https://hashapi.tierion.com/v1/auth/token

```
apiStem = 'https://hashapi.tierion.com/v1'

login_creds = {
    'username': 'youremail@here.com',
    'password': 'yourpassword',
}

reqToken = requests.post(apiPath + '/auth/token', json=login_creds)
reqToken.json()

token = reqToken.json()['access_token']
auth1 = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token}
```

The variable auth1 now contains your access token which is active for one hour. 

### Submit a string to Hash

Now we would like to send a string to get encrypted using SHA-256




```
hashText = hashlib.sha256("Matthew Sedaghatfar Using the BlockChain").hexdigest()
hashItem = '/hashitems'
myHash = {'hash': hashText}
```

Then we send this hash to Tierion and get back a receiptId and timestamp.
```
respHash = requests.post(apiStem + hashItem, json= myHash, headers = auth1)
receipt = respHash.json()['receiptId']

respHash.json()
```

### Retreive the receipt
```
getReceipts = '/receipts/'

getRec = requests.get(apiStem + getReceipts + receipt,headers = auth1)
getRe.json()
```

### Conclusion

Some use cases of a Hash API is to store predictions or keeping records of Lease aggrements.
