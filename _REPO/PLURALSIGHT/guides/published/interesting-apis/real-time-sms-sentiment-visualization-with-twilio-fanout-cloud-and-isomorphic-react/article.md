In this tutorial, we're going to build an application to visualize, in real-time, SMS messages sent to a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) phone number using sentiment analysis provided by the Marchex Sentiment Analysis plugin.

We'll be using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for the web server, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for exposing our local server publicly, [Fanout Cloud](https://fanout.io/) for the real-time functionality, and ([isomorphic](http://isomorphic.net/)) [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the view.

When a SMS is sent to the Twilio Number, information about the SMS is sent to our Node.js server.

Then, we extract the relevant information and publish it to a Fanout Cloud's channel. The channel information is received in a web page that shows the information in this way:

![App demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/17a85122-2db2-4e84-865e-7c58df8ed809.gif)


Notice how the background changes depending on the sentiment. Moreover, there are transitions when new messages appear. The design was inspired by this [pen](http://codepen.io/bundleio/pen/regPeX).

The gauge comes from [Epoch](http://epochjs.github.io/epoch/), a real-time charting library that uses jQuery. Some would say React and jQuery should never be used together (because of the way React creates its components). We could have chosen another [gauge component with better React integration](http://michigan-com.github.io/react-gauge), but __React can play well with libraries like jQuery__. Sometimes, you have no option but to use a jQuery plugin in a React application. Not just that, Epoch charts look better than others.

Finally, with a couple of modifications, we'll make this application isomorphic, or universal.

The source code of the final version of the application is available on [Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/sms-sentiment).

Let's start by setting up the required components for our application.

# Requirements
### Twilio
We'll need [a trial account from Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/how-does-twilios-free-trial-work). Go to [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) to open one. 

When your personal phone number has been verified, you can get a Twilio phone number [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/getting-started):

![Get phone number](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/39d2308e-c05d-4a10-a3ad-63b581110d4b.png)


__Make sure to choose a phone number with SMS capabilities__:

![Choose phone number](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/b53d98e8-e422-408e-9af4-3d8db32f4b2f.png)


Now go to [Messaging - Programmable SMS - Add-ons](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/add-ons):

![Add-ons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/eddfbbd2-397e-472e-ad2a-2b26765c3fc0.png)


Choose the plug-in called __Marchex Sentiment Analysis for SMS__:

![Choose add-on](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/dfacd190-ad1c-40ab-ae03-92b01feb91d5.png)


The Marchex Sentiment Analysis add-on takes an SMS message and computes a sentiment score between `0.0` and `1.0`, where `0.0` is most negative sentiment and `1.0` is the most positive sentiment:

![Marchex Sentiment Analysis add-on](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/b45dcac5-5e84-4457-a684-5a43ccc9a5a5.png)


Press the *Install* button and agree to the terms of the service. You'll see the following screen as confirmation:

![Install add-on](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/f615602c-cf12-43ed-b098-b32c282b3f64.png)


Check the *Use In Incoming SMS Message* option and press the *Save* button.

Finally, go to your [console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and copy your Auth Token, you may need it later:

![Twilio Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/fbb92d2f-65e5-4d27-8d87-2d694e5ea08a.png)

### Ngrok
When an SMS is sent to our Twilio number, a webhook will be triggered (think of it as a callback). This means an HTTP request will be made to our server, so we'll either need to deploy our application on the cloud or keep it locally and use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Ngrok proxies external requests to your local machine by creating a secure tunnel and giving you a public URL.

It is a Go program, distributed as a single executable file (with no additional dependencies). So for now, just download it from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download) and unzip the compressed file.


### Fanout Cloud

We'll need a Fanout account, [sign up here](https://fanout.io/account/signup/).

When the account is activated, go to your dashboard:

![Fanout Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/8bcde085-ddf6-4d11-b1c5-eede0fa00b84.png)

To copy your Realm ID and Realm Key, we'll need them later.

### Node.js

You'll also need to have Node.js version 4.4 or higher and npm installed. You can download an installer for your platform [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


Now that we have all we need, let's create the app.


# Setting up the application

Create a new directory and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir sms-sentiment && cd sms-sentiment
```

__We're going to use ECMAScript 2015__ so let's set up [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transform this syntax to one most browsers can understand by creating the configuration file `.babelrc`:
```
echo '{ "presets": ["react", "es2015", "stage-0"] }' > .babelrc
```

Babel 6.x does not ship with any transformations enabled, so you need to explicitly tell it what transformations to run by using a __preset__.

The first two are self-descriptive. The stage-x presets are changes to the language that havenâ€™t been approved to be part of a release of Javascript.

The [TC39](https://github.com/tc39) categorizes proposals into 4 stages:

- stage-0 - Strawman: just an idea, possible Babel plugin. 
- stage-1 - Proposal: this is worth working on.
- stage-2 - Draft: initial spec.
- stage-3 - Candidate: complete spec and initial browser implementations.
- stage-4 - Finished: will be added to the next yearly release.

`stage-0` includes all plugins from presets of all levels. `stage-1` includes all plugins from presets 1 to 4 and so on.

To execute Babel and bundle our scripts with their dependencies, we'll use [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) and npm. Let's install Webpack (globally):
```
npm install -g webpack
```

(Don't forget to add `sudo` if you're working on Linux.)

Now add a `package.json` configuration file with:
```
npm init
```

Alternatively, if you want to accept all the defaults:
```
npm init -y
```

Next, install the Babel dependencies and presets (and a polyfill to emulate a full ES2015 environment) with:
```
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-0 babel-polyfill
```

Do the same with Webpack:
```
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

We're using `--save-dev` because these dependencies are only required to develop the application. For that reason, they can be listed under the `devDependencies` section of `package.json`. 

For running the application, we'll need Express, React, Twilio, Fanout, and other dependencies. Let's add them now:
```
npm install --save express ejs body-parser path react react-dom twilio fanoutpub faye
```

Next, create a `webpack.config.js` file with the following content:
```javascript
var path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: ['./src/app.js'],

    output: {
        filename: 'public/js/bundle.js',
        sourceMapFilename: 'public/js/bundle.map'
    },

    devtool: '#source-map',
    
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                loader: 'babel',
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This way, Webpack will create a `public/js/bundle.js` file with all of the application's JavaScript code (from the script `/src/app.js`).

Next, create a `config.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	twilio: {
	    validate   :  false
    },

    fanout: {
        realm_id   : '<YOUR_FANOUT_REALM_ID>',
        realm_key  : '<YOUR_FANOUT_REALM_KEY>'
    },

    channel: 'sms',

	port: process.env.APP_PORT || 3000
}
```

Finally, add the following `start` script to `package.json`. This script packs our application and starts the Node.js server:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack && node server.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

We'll review the `server.js` code in the next section.

# Setting up Express

Let's start by setting up a simple Express web application. 

Create the `server.js` file and write the following `require` statements:
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var ejs = require('ejs');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var path = require('path');
var config = require('./config');
```

Now create the Express object:
```javascript
var app = express();
```

Add the configuration to capture both the body and URL parameters:
```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

Add the configuration of the public directory (to serve CSS files, for example):
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

We'll be using [EJS](http://ejs.co/) as the template library, so let's define `views` as the directory to store our templates and configure Express to use EJS as the view engine:
```javascript
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Next, let's add the following code to respond to the `/` route with the `index` template:
```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	res.render('index', {});
});
```

And create the corresponding `views/index.ejs` file with some content, for example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>SMS Sentiment</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Back to the `server.js` file, add the code to start the server:
```javascript
app.listen(config.port, function() {
    console.log('Server up and listening on port %d', config.port);
});
```

If you execute the command `node server.js` and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever your host and port are), you should see something like this:

![Hello World](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/3ed08101-23fc-4e11-9793-0b7ea1a8794d.png)


In the next section, we'll expose our server to the Internet with ngrok.


# Setting up ngrok
In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where you unzipped ngrok. 

We'll start ngrok by dictating which port we want to expose to the Internet. In this case, we'll tell it to expose port `3000`:
```
./ngrok http 3000
```

If you're on Windows, the ngrok syntax is slightly simpler:
```
ngrok http 3000
```

Now, you should see something like this:

![Ngrok Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/d58ac65f-7849-498b-9beb-e6920a65802b.png)

See that URL in the *Forwarding* row(s) with the `ngrok.io` domain? __That's your public URL.__ Your's will be different than mine, since ngrok generates a random URL every time you run it.

If you open in a browser `http://[YOUR_GENERATED_SUBDOMAIN].ngrok.io`, you should see the same page found on `http://localhost:3000`:

![Hello World with Ngrok](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/37017d14-e65e-4cee-8468-d4f4fa31e40b.png)

Open this ngrok URL on another computer if you want to test this out. Once again, you should see the same page. __Our local server is now available publicly.__

The only disadvantage to this architecture is that our URL is not permanent. If you restart ngrok, it will give you another URL, likely a different one.

You can specify a fixed subdomain. For example, to get the URL  `http://sms.ngrok.io` use the command:
```
ngrok http -subdomain=sms 3000
```

However, this requires a paid plan. You can get more info about it in this [page](https://ngrok.com/product).

Nevertheless, as long as you don't stop or restart ngrok, the URL won't change, so forget about that terminal window, let's leave it running for now.

In the next section, we'll review the Twilio API for receiving/sending SMS messages.


# Receiving SMS messages

Let's configure our Twilio number to communicate to our server when it receives an SMS message.

Go to your [Phone Numbers Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) and select your phone number. The following screen will be shown:

![Phone Numbers console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/c731fc4b-86f0-4e10-8e7d-163428a66c3c.png)

Let's say that Twilio will call the `/sms` route in our server, so enter your ngrok URL with this route in the corresponding field of the *Messaging* section:

![Twilio Phone Number Webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/6a8aaddd-59b4-4061-ad99-bccfcb561afc.png)


Make sure the HTTP request type is set to *POST*. Save your changes.

Now, we'll add the code to receive the message on the `/sms` route.

We'll be using the Twilio API for Node.js, which is documented on [http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/).

At the beginning of the `server.js` file, import the Twilio module:
```javascript
var Twilio = require('twilio');
```
And before (or after) the definition of the `/` route, add the following code:
```javascript
app.post('/sms', Twilio.webhook(config.twilio),function(req, res) {

});
```

This will define the `/sms` POST route and the [Twilio.webhook](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/#webhook) function, which acts as a [Express middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) that determines if the request was sent by Twilio. This webhook also makes the Express response object aware of TwimlResponse objects.

However, the `config.twilio` object that we specify automatically defines the `validate` option as `false`, which disables this validation. If the validation is enabled (you'll need to enable it if you don't want to receive requests from anyone), this function will look to the environment variable `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` for your Twilio auth token to validate the request. 

When Twilio sends an HTTP request to your server, it includes a value in the header that is signed with your auth token. So, if you enable this option, make sure to export this variable before running the server. On Linux, for example, do it this way:
```
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx0xxx00xx0xxxxxxx0xxxx0xxxx00xxx0
```

Moving on, when an SMS is sent to your Twilio number, your server will get an object like the following:
```
{
 ToCountry: 'US',
  ToState: 'NJ',
  SmsMessageSid: 'SMc1cc1b8b81b28dceb80b42a925d37777',
  NumMedia: '0',
  ToCity: 'NEWTON',
  FromZip: '',
  SmsSid: 'SMc1cc1b8b81b28dceb80b42a925d37777',
  FromState: 'Df.',
  SmsStatus: 'received',
  FromCity: 'Mexico',
  Body: 'This is a test',
  FromCountry: 'MX',
  To: '+1201555555',
  ToZip: '07860',
  AddOns: '{
				"status":"successful",
				"message":null,
				"code":null,
				"results":{
					"marchex_sentiment":{
						"request_sid":"XR8b665c4741eabb7c3382d814be2d225r",
						"status":"successful",
						"message":null,
						"code":null,
						"result":{
							"result":0.1545030027627945
						}
					}
				}
			}',
  NumSegments: '1',
  MessageSid: 'SMc7cc1b8b81b28dceb80b42a925d37089',
  AccountSid: 'AC1127a09cf75ed2265926304233f3a2e7',
  From: '+52555555555',
  ApiVersion: '2010-04-01'
}
```

As you can see, there's a lot of information on this object. For this application, we'll only use the text of the message, the number, the country from which it was sent, and the sentiment result.

So let's extract this information with the following code:
```javascript
app.post('/sms', Twilio.webhook(config.twilio),function(req, res) {
	var  addOn = JSON.parse(req.body.AddOns);

	// Create a data object with the properties you want to send
    var msg = {
        text: req.body.Body,
        from: req.body.From,
        sentiment: addOn.results.marchex_sentiment.result.result,
        country: req.body.FromCountry
    };
});
```

Additionally, let's respond to this message to acknowledge it was received. To do this, we'll need to send back a [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml) response:
```javascript
app.post('/sms', Twilio.webhook(config.twilio),function(req, res) {
    var  addOn = JSON.parse(req.body.AddOns);

	// Create a data object with the properties you want to send
    var msg = {
        text: req.body.Body,
        from: req.body.From,
        sentiment: addOn.results.marchex_sentiment.result.result,
        country: req.body.FromCountry
    };

    // Create a TwiML response
    var twiml = new Twilio.TwimlResponse();
    twiml.message('Message received');
    
    // Send the TwiML response as XML
    res.send(twiml.toString());
});
```

If we restart the server with these changes and then send an SMS message to our Twilio number, we should receive an SMS with the following text:
```
Sent from your Twilio trial account:
Message received
```

Ngrok keeps a log of all the traffic going through it, and this bookkeeping is essential to our application. Go to [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) and you should see something like this:

![Ngrok Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/8e3d1e58-564c-4171-8bb9-1031dbd99f7b.png)

You can even replay a request with the *Replay* button located in the right top of the window when you select one request from the list on the left.

At the bottom of the same window, you can see the TwiML response:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><Response><Message>Message received</Message></Response>
```

If you select your Twilio number on your [Phone Numbers Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) and then select the *View Messages Inbound* option, you'll see the message you just sent:

![Twilio incoming SMS messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/ab494749-6399-481e-987d-eb6dc5f900ba.png)


The same applies to the response sent by Twilio with the *View Messages Outbound* option.

Now let's talk about Fanout Cloud.

# Publishing messages with Fanout Cloud

[Fanout](https://fanout.io) is a publish/subscribe service that makes it easy to build real-time APIs and applications.

It's based on [Pushpin](http://pushpin.org/), an open source reverse proxy that in turn, makes it easy to create [WebSocket, HTTP streaming, and HTTP long-polling](http://pushpin.org/about/) services using any web stack as the back-end.

There are two main ways you can use Fanout:
- **Publish/Subscribe Messaging**. To send data using protocols, such as Bayeux and XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). 
    - WebSockets are supported automatically when possible.
- **Custom real-time API**. To send data using five low-level network transports: HTTP long-polling, HTTP streaming, WebSockets, Webhooks (outbound HTTP), and XMPP.

You can find more information about this on its [quickstart guide](https://fanout.io/docs/devguide.html#quickstart).

The application will use Fanout's publish/subscribe service to get the SMS information in real-time. This will be done with [Faye](https://faye.jcoglan.com/), a Bayeux-compatible client library.

Why use Fanout Cloud when we can do the same with a simple WebSocket library like [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)? Well, [you might not need to use WebSockets](http://blog.fanout.io/2014/06/24/you-might-not-need-a-websocket/). Also, by using Fanout's infrastructure, you don't have to worry about neither scalability nor additional server to manage.

Fanout is organized by realms and channels. A realm can contain any number of channels and different realms may use the same channel names without any problem. Messages are published to channels, and messages are relayed to the subscribers of each channel for that realm.

When you create a Fanout account, one realm will be automatically created for you. In contrast, channels are created on demand at any time.

To send the object with the SMS information, we'll use the Node.js Fanout library.

At the beginning of the `server.js` file, import the Fanout module:
```javascript
var Fanout = require('fanoutpub');
```

Before the definition of the `/sms` route, initialize the Fanout object passing your Realm ID and Realm Key in this way:
```javascript
var fanout = new Fanout.Fanout(config.fanout.realm_id, config.fanout.realm_key);
```

To publish the object with the SMS information, call the `publish()` function. It takes two parameters: a channel, and the object within the channel that we want to publish:
```javascript
fanout.publish(config.channel, msg);
```

Just like that, we're on our way to make a real-time application. In the following section, we'll set up a the view with React.


# Creating the view with React

Let's start by defining the HTML that will contain our React application. Modify `views/index.ejs` so it looks like the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>SMS Sentiment</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/simplegrid.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/epoch/0.8.4/epoch.min.css">
</head>
<body class="epoch-my-gauge-theme">

    <div id="root"></div>

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.17/d3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/epoch/0.8.4/epoch.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/bundle.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

We'll use [Simple Grid](http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/) to create the layout, so create the `public/css` directories and download the file https://github.com/ThisIsDallas/Simple-Grid/blob/master/simplegrid.css

Next, create the `style.css` file:
```css
html, body, #root {
	height: 100%;
	width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
}

#container {
    min-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
    overflow-y: auto;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    color: #fff;
    transition: all 7s ease-in-out; 
}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge-labels .value{fill:#fff;}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge .arc.outer{stroke:#fff;}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge .arc.inner{stroke:#fff;}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge .tick{stroke:#fff;}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge .needle{fill:orange;}

.epoch-my-gauge-theme .epoch .gauge .needle-base{fill:#fff;}

#real-time-gauge {
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.msgs {
	list-style: none;
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 1.5em 2em;
}

.msgs .msg {
    margin-bottom: 1.5em;
    padding-top: 1.5em;
}

.msgs .msg + .msg {
    border-top: 1px solid #fff;
}

.msgs .msg-from {
    margin-bottom: 0.4em;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.msgs .msg-text {
    font-style: italic;
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
}

.msgs .msg-text:before, .msg .msg-text:after {
    content: '"';
}

.msgs .msg-info {
    margin-top: 1.5em;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    list-style: none;
}

.msgs .msg-info li {
    float: left;
}

.msgs .msg-info li + li {
    margin-left: 1em;
}

.msgs .msg-info li span {
    font-style: italic;
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
}

.center-align {
    text-align: center;
}
```

As said before, we'll be using the Epoch library, so here we're just defining a custom style (`epoch-my-gauge-theme`) for the gauge along with styles for the SMS messages.

Back to the HTML file, we're also adding:
- The Epoch CSS file (`epoch.min.css`)
- The element where the React elements will be injected (`<div id="root"></div>`)
- The required JS files needed by Epoch, jQuery, and the [D3 visualization library](https://d3js.org/), required by the first one (although the lastest version of this library at the time of this writing is 4.1.1, Epoch requires version 3.X.X).
- The `bundle.js` file built by Webpack.

The `src` directory will store the JavaScript code of our application. Inside it, we're going to structure the application in the following way:
```
src
|â€” components
| | |â€” gauge.js
| | |â€” gauge-container.js
| | |â€” index.js
| | |â€” message.js
| | |â€” messages.js
| |â€” app.js
```

The starting point will be `app.js`:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import Index from './components/index';

ReactDOM.render(<Index />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This file renders the components defined in `components/index.js` in the element with ID `root`. Structuring the initial point of our app this way will helps us later to make it isomorphic.

The `index` component will be the main container for our application. At this level, the app will subscribe to the Fanout channel to listen for SMS messages. Let's first import everything we'll need:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import GaugeContainer from './gauge-container';
import Messages from './messages';

import Faye from 'faye';
import config from '../../config';
```


And then create the Faye client pointing to your Fanout Realm ID:
```javascript
var fanout = new Faye.Client(`http://${config.fanout.realm_id}.fanoutcdn.com/bayeux`);
```

Next, in the constructor of the exported component, define the state properties we're going to use:
```javascript
export default class App extends Component {
  
	constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            messages: [], 
            background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #2979FF 0%, #FF1744 100%)',
            sentiment: 0
        };
	}
	
}
```

The state of the component includes:
- `messages`: the array that will store the objects (with the SMS information) received via Fanout.
- `background`: the style to show the gradient background that will change depending on the sentiment of the latest message.
- `sentiment`: the sentiment value of the latest message.

According to the [React Component Lifecycle Specification](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html), `componentDidMount()` is executed once, only on the client, not on the server (remember this point when we make our application isomorphic), and it's the method to use to integrate other JavaScript frameworks, or send AJAX requests.

So let's subscribe to the Fanout channel in the `componentDidMount()` method (notice the `/` character to refer to the channel):
```javascript
componentDidMount() {
	fanout.subscribe('/' + config.channel, this.updateMessages).then(() => {
		console.log('Subscribed to ' + config.channel);
	});
}

updateMessages = (data) =>{
	var p1 = 0, p2 = 100;
	if(data.sentiment < 0.5) {
		p1 = (0.5 - data.sentiment) * 100;
	} else {
		p2 = (1 - (data.sentiment - 0.5)) * 100;
	}
	
	this.setState({
			messages: [ data, ...this.state.messages ],
			background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #2979FF ${p1}%, #FF1744 ${p2}%)`,
			sentiment: data.sentiment
	});
}
```

When a message arrives, the `updateMessages` function is executed. Notice how the sentiment is used to calculate the percentage of the gradient for each color (I'm sure there are better algorithms to achieve it, but this does the job), and how the new message is prepended to the existing array of messages.

In this case, [the spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) (`...`) is used [to get all the elements of the array and form a new one](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/front-end-javascript/enforcing-immutability-with-es2015). React works best with immutable objects, so instead of simply adding the new element to the existing array with a function like [splice()](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp), we create a new array.

In the `render()` method, we use the state properties for the background style and pass the SMS information to the subcomponents:
```javascript
render() {
	const style = { background: this.state.background };

	return (
		<div id="container" className={'grid'} style={style}>
			<GaugeContainer sentiment={this.state.sentiment}  />
			<Messages messages={this.state.messages} />
		</div>
	);
}
```

The `GaugeContainer` component is a wrapper for the `Gauge` component:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Gauge from './gauge';

export default class GaugeContainer extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className={'col-1-1'}>
                <div className={'content center-align'}>
                    <h1>SMS Sentiment</h1>
                    <Gauge sentiment={this.props.sentiment} />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

This `Gauge` component creates the actual gauge in the `componentDidMount()` function using the Epoch library:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class Gauge extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        // store the object on `this.gauge` so we can access elsewhere
        this.gauge = $(this.refs.gauge).epoch({ type: 'time.gauge', value: this.props.sentiment });
    }

    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
        this.gauge.update(nextProps.sentiment);   
	}

    render() {
        return (
            <div id="real-time-gauge" className={'epoch gauge-large'} ref="gauge"></div>
        );
    }
}
```

Notice how the `div` element, in which the component is rendered, is referenced with `ref` and `this.refs`. You may have seen other tutorials get the DOM element of a component by using either the `ReactDOM.getDOMNode()` or the `ReactDOM.findDOMNode()` functions. However, [after React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html), `this.refs` is the recommended way to access the DOM. _Remember that React works with a Virtual DOM while jQuery works with the *real* DOM._

We saved a reference to the Epoch gauge component (`this.gauge`), so when the sentiment property is updated, the gauge can be updated too (in the `componentWillReceiveProps` function).

To render the messages, the `Messages` component acts like a container:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactCSSTransitionGroup from 'react-addons-css-transition-group';
import Message from './message';

export default class Messages extends Component {
  
	constructor(props) {
        super(props);
	}
  
	render() {
        const messagesMapped = this.props.messages.map((result, index) => {
            const key = this.props.messages.length - index;
            return <Message message={result} key={key} />
        });
        
        return <div className={'col-1-1'}>
                    <div className={'content'}>
                        <ReactCSSTransitionGroup component="ul" className="msgs" transitionName="msg-transition" transitionEnterTimeout={500} transitionLeaveTimeout={500}>
                            {messagesMapped}
                        </ReactCSSTransitionGroup>
                    </div>
                </div>;
	}
}
```

This code is significant for two main reasons. 

First, React requires every message component in a collection to have a unique identifier defined by the `key` property. This helps React determine when elements are added or removed. 

For example, s new elements are prepended instead of appended, we can't give the first element the index `0` as key, since this will only work the first time an element is added. In fact, for the elements added next in line, there will be an element with key `0` already. Therefore, keys are assigned this way:
```javascript
const key = this.props.messages.length - index;
```

The second thing is that we use the `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` add-on component to animate the insertion of a new SMS message on the page. We can do the same thing by [using plain CSS only](https://www.christianheilmann.com/2015/08/30/quicky-fading-in-a-newly-created-element-using-css/), but let's figure out how to do it the React way.

First install this module with NPM:
```
npm install --save react-addons-css-transition-group
```

`ReactCSSTransitionGroup` wraps the elements that you want to animate. By default, it renders a `span` to wrap them, but since we're going to work with `li` elements, we specify the wrapper tag `ul` with the `component` property. `className` becomes a property of the rendered component, as any other property that doesn't belong to `ReactCSSTransitionGroup`.

`transitionName` is the prefix used to identify the CSS classes to perform the animation. Based on this, add the following CSS classes to `public/css/style.css`:
```css
.msg-transition-enter {
	opacity: 0.01;
}

.msg-transition-enter.msg-transition-enter-active {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: opacity 500ms ease-in;
}

.msg-transition-leave {
    opacity: 1;
}

.msg-transition-leave.msg-transition-leave-active {
    opacity: 0.01;
    transition: opacity 500ms ease-in;
}
```

Notice that animation duration needs to be specified in both the CSS and the component properties.

You can find more information about [animations in React here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html).

Finally, the `Message` component renders the SMS information in the following way:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class Message extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render() {
        const {from, text, country, sentiment} = this.props.message;
        return (
            <li className={'msg'}>
                <div className={'msg-from'}>+XXXXX - XXX - {from.slice(-4)}</div>
                <div className={'msg-text'}>{text}</div>
                <ul className={'msg-info'}>
                    <li>
                        Country: <span>{country}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sentiment: <span>{sentiment}</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        );
    }
}
```

Now if we run the application using `npm start`, Webpack will bundle all the client files and you should see this page in the browser:

![Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/9124f561-d035-487b-8bc1-c66394e4c229.png)

You can play with the application either by sending SMS messages to your Twilio number or [by replaying the request with Ngrok](http://localhost:4040/). If you're trying the latter option, make sure that you have the webhook validation disabled. If you go to your Fanout Control Panel and then click on the *Stats* button, you'll see the following information:

![Fanout Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/guides/master/images/5f811ac9-fad7-4f75-9479-9956f950d2ba.gif)

# Isomorphic React
We now have a fully functional application, but why stop here? Let's turn this application into an isomorphic one.

Isomorphic ([or universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.rfgasv9bh)) is a term that means that the same JavaScript code can run on the client and server without modification, so the server can generate the page and serve it as plain HTML.

In essence, server-rendering is a simple concept achieved with only one function call on Node.js:
```javascript
const appHTML = renderToString(<App/>)
```

However, Node.js doesn't know about JSX (the syntax used by React; `<App>`), so what we can do is to use Webpack to build a server bundle, just like the client bundle.

Create the file `webpack.server.config.js` with the following content:
```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

module.exports = {

    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'server.js'),

    output: {
        filename: 'server.bundle.js'
    },

    target: 'node',

    externals: fs.readdirSync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules')).concat([
        'react-dom/server', 'react/addons',
    ]).reduce(function (ext, mod) {
        ext[mod] = 'commonjs ' + mod
        return ext
    }, {}),

	node: {
	    __filename: true,
	    __dirname: true
    },

	module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                loader: 'babel',
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }
        ]
    }

}
```

This file tells Webpack to take `server.js` as the entry point to generate the `server.bundle.js` file with all its dependencies bundled together. 

The `target: 'node'` option tells webpack not to touch any Node.js built-in modules. However, Webpack will load modules from the `node_modules` directory and bundle them too. To avoid this, we use the `externals` option. A module listed as an external won't be bundled. For more on externals, see [this page](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#externals).

Unfortunately, using `externals` assumes a browser environment, so something like `require('twilio')` will be turned into the global variable `twilio`. To keep our `require` statements, we need to create an object with a key/value of each module name and to prefix the value with `commonjs`. 

Next, [options](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#node) are passed to `node` so `__filename` and `__dirname` work as expected.

Open `server.js` and import the React modules that we'll use (thanks to Webpack and Babel, we can now use `import` instead of `require`):
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import App from './src/components/index'
```

And replace the `/` route definition with the following:
```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	const appHtml = renderToString(<App/>);

    res.render('index', {
        appHtml: appHtml
    });
});
```

Notice that we're using `src/components/index.js` instead of `src/app.js` to render the app on the server side. The reason is that `src/app.js` references the DOM (Document Object Model), which is a browser concept that doesn't exist in the server.

Likewise, since `componentDidMount` can contain references to the DOM, it won't be executed on the server side. But don't worry, when the React app is loaded in the client (remember that the entry point in the client is still `src/app.js`), this function will be executed.

Also, modify `/views/index.ejs` so it can render the generated HTML:
```html
...
<div id="root"><%- appHtml %></div>
...
```

In EJS, the `<%-` tag outputs the unescaped value of the object into the template (in contrast to the more commonly used `<%=`).

Make sure that you don't leave any space between the opening and closing `div` tag, otherwise, React will complain about the blank space.

Finally, we have to modify the `start` script from `package.json` to generate the server bundle every time the server is started. Let's organize our scripts in this way:
```javascript
...
"scripts": {
    "start": "npm run build && node server.bundle.js",
    "build:client": "webpack",
    "build:server": "webpack --config webpack.server.config.js",
    "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server"
},
...
```

`npm run build` will trigger the generation of the server and client bundles and `node server.bundle.js` will start the server with the generated bundle instead of `server.js`.

Type `npm start` and try the app. It should work like before but with the [advantages of isomorphic javascript](http://www.capitalone.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-isomorphic-javascript/).

# Conclusion
We have created a single page application with React that gets SMS information with the help of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and shows it in real-time using [Fanout Cloud](https://fanout.io). We also made it isomorphic with little modifications. Combining the right APIs, you can get simple yet powerful applications.

Remember that the code is [on Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/sms-sentiment). Thanks for reading. Please leave all comments and feedback in the discussion section below. Pleasa favorite this tutorial if you found it informative!
