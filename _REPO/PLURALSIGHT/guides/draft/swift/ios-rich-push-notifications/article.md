These days, having a visually stunning mobile app isnâ€™t good enough. In order for your mobile app to be truly successful, it must be designed with UX in mind. Push Notifications are a great solution to interact with your app consumers even when they are not using the application.

 This guide will walk you through setting up your project for rich push notifications, you will learn some server-side requirements and we will peek into the infinite possibilities!


## Setup

In order to get started with push notifications, you need to follow these steps:


1.  Open existing Xcode project or create New. Select your project target and go to Capabilities to enable Push Notifications as shown [here][1]. 
2. Open **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...** Fill the required fields and choose either to email CA the request or save it to disk. Go to [your Apple member center][2] and locate your App ID. You will see that "Push Notifications" service is now *Configurable*. Select the ` Edit` button. Under Push Notifications section there are two options for certificates as shown [here][3]. Select the **Create Certificate** button to create your Certificate.

 > **Development Certificate** - App built from Xcode will receive notifications.

 > **Production Certificate** -App installed from Apple Store or Test Flight will receive notifications.

3. Upload your *.certSigningRequest* file you prevously saved on disk/emailed the CA, download your generated Certificate and double-click the *.cer* file to install it in your Keychain Access.
4. Locate your Certificate in Keychain Access under
    "Certificates" section and export it as shown [here][4]
// No link provided?
Your Certificate is now saved as .p12 file. If you need your Certificate as `.pem/.p8` file you can easy convert it
```
    $ openssl pkcs12 -in CertName.p12 -out CertName.pem -nodes -clcerts
```

## Registering for push notifications
 Simply as that in your AppDelegate file:

```
import UIKit
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self

    if #available(iOS 10, *) {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options:[.badge, .alert, .sound]) { granted, error in }
    } else {
       application.registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.badge, .sound, .alert], categories: nil))
    }
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    return true
 }
...

```
 Add the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` function in your AppDelegate.swift file to get the deviceToken, which will receive notifications.

```
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
   let deviceTokenString = deviceToken.reduce("") { $0 + String(format: "%02X", $1) }
   print("APNs device token: \(deviceTokenString)")
}
...
```

Awesome! Now it's time to make them super duper nice-looking. ðŸ™€

## Displaying push notifications

> NB: Your notifications interface should feel like natural extension of your containing app!

A very important step for sending media attachment is the `mutable-content` key in the push payload from the server. So let's take a look at this example payload.

<div class="code-snippet">
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="json">
{
   "aps": {
       "alert": "Hello!",
       "sound": "default",
       "mutable-content": 1,
       "badge": 1
   },
   "data": {
       "attachment-url": "https://example.com/attachment.jpg"
   }
}
</code></pre>
</div>


From **Xcode > File > New > Target...** select *Notification Service Extension* and activate suggested scheme. Notice that there are two autogenerated files now - NotificationService.swift and Info.plist.

In the `NotificationService.swift` file handle the media url from the payload for example with FileManager:

```
...
override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        self.contentHandler = contentHandler
        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)

        func failEarly() {
            contentHandler(request.content)
        }

        guard let content = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent) else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let apnsData = content.userInfo["data"] as? [String: Any] else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let attachmentURL = apnsData["attachment-url"] as? String else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let imageData = NSData(contentsOf:NSURL(string: attachmentURL)! as URL) else { return failEarly() }
        guard let attachment = UNNotificationAttachment.create(imageFileIdentifier: "image.gif", data: imageData, options: nil) else { return failEarly() }

        content.attachments = [attachment]
        contentHandler(content.copy() as! UNNotificationContent)
    }
...
```

... and this `UNNotificationAttachment`extension func to save the media to disk:

```
extension UNNotificationAttachment {
    static func create(imageFileIdentifier: String, data: NSData, options: [NSObject : AnyObject]?) -> UNNotificationAttachment? {

            let fileManager = FileManager.default
            let tmpSubFolderName = ProcessInfo.processInfo.globallyUniqueString
            let fileURLPath      = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory())
            let tmpSubFolderURL  = fileURLPath.appendingPathComponent(tmpSubFolderName, isDirectory: true)

            do {
                try fileManager.createDirectory(at: tmpSubFolderURL!, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)
                let fileURL = tmpSubFolderURL?.appendingPathComponent(imageFileIdentifier)
                try data.write(to: fileURL!, options: [])
                let imageAttachment = try UNNotificationAttachment.init(identifier: imageFileIdentifier, url: fileURL!, options: options)
                return imageAttachment
            } catch let error {
                print("error \(error)")
            }

        return nil
    }
}
```

Voila!

## Adding actions to push notifications

Let's add some actions to our Rich Push Notifications. Modify the payload by adding "category" key to notify that we want to display actions.

```
{
   "aps": {
       "alert": "Hello!",
       "sound": "default",
       "mutable-content": 1,
       "badge": 1,
       "category": "myCategoryName"
   },
   "data": {
       "attachment-url": "https://example.com/attachment.jpg"
   }
}
```
 In the autogenerated Notification Service Info.plist add UNNotificationExtensionCategory Array with max 4 actions identifiers.

![enter image description here][6]

 Set the notification category in your `didReceiveRequest` func in the `NotificationService.swift` file

<div class="code-snippet">
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-swift">
...
let meowAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "meow", title: "Meow", options: [])
let pizzaAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "pizza", title: "Pizza?", options: [])

let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: "myCategoryName", actions: [meowAction, pizzaAction], intentIdentifiers: [], options: [])
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories([category])
...
</code></pre>
</div>

Simple as that! Time for preview:

ðŸŽ‰

![Rich Push Notifications - Actions][7]

Finally add the logic for the notifications buttons in the AppDelegate.swift file, using the identifiers we specified in the Info.plist file earlier. The method we call is **didReceive response** from the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`

```
...
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {

        if response.actionIdentifier == "meow" {
            ...
        }
        if response.actionIdentifier == "pizza" {
            ...
        }
        completionHandler()
    }
...
```


>  Warning!
Don't forget to update the badge icon number when needed!


```
application.applicationIconBadgeNumber = 0
```

## Custom preview

 Last but not least let's add a custom preview for notifications from **Xcode > File > New > Target...** select *Notification Content* and activate suggested scheme. Now we have `NotificationViewController.swift`, `MainInterface.storyboard` and `Info.plist` files.

## Conclusion - The sky is the limit

It's up to your imagination from now on... or take a look at the sample project included below to begin with something cool!
