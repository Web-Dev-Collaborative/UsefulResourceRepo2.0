*Our focus is on getting Chip-and-PIN in place in time for the holidays - [Target Stores CEO Brian Cornell](http://www.recode.net/2015/5/27/11563020/target-ceo-loves-apple-pay-but-wants-chip-and-pin-cards-first)*

If you look at the credit and debit cards in your wallet, you will see differences among them beyond just the bank, logo, color, and card issuer. Some will have little pads on them that look like symbols from a B-grade sci-fi movie.

The good news is that since October 2015, we have be learning a new move at the cash register called [“Chip-and-Dip,”](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/10/01/transition-chip-and-pin-credit-cards-what-you-need-know/72571816/&sa=D&ust=1462923757584000&usg=AFQjCNHyq-SX-Pemhzvu3M4orhvqBSrpOg), and it’s becoming more secure.

[EMV](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/emv-faq-chip-cards-answers-1264.php&sa=D&ust=1462923757588000&usg=AFQjCNFHuV_INWMGVkeiwRBSd-pMlJFlBw) is an acronym for the three principal organizations promoting the use of so-called chip-enabled credit cards.  It stands for EuroPay-MasterCard-Visa, although American Express, Discover Card, JCB (in Japan), and other international issuers support the standard as well.  EMV has been the standard in Europe and Canada for nearly a decade or more, and the United States is just catching up.  The move to chip-cards was boosted by the very famous hacker attack on Target stores in which cybercriminals obtained financial records for 110 million people. According to DataLossDB, this Target breach was one of the largest data breaches ever.

### Payment Technologies

Your EMV card works very similarly to your current credit or debit card.  It has a magnetic strip on the back used to swipe. It has the card number, expiration date, cardholder name, bank name and a 3-digit security code on the back. However, the EMV chip card stripe is only used as a backup for the chip, or when the business can’t complete EMV transactions.  You’ll “Chip-and-Dip” by putting the card lengthwise into a chip reader, either at the base of the device or into a slot at the top.  The device beeps once the transaction is completed, and the card is ready to be removed. Target Stores and WalMart are some of the leaders in implementing the chip reader.  Once the chip is read by the reader, it works with the point-of-sale terminal to [“tokenize”](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2487635/data-security/banks-push-for-tokenization-standard-to-secure-credit-card-payments.html) the transaction, so it is encrypted and unique.  No one can get your credit card number and hackers can’t “replay” the transaction later.

There will be a minor change in the way you buy things.  The card will stay in the reader for the duration of the actual purchase, which may make the sale a little slower.  In the US, the card reader is usually wired to the cash register at the point-of-sale.  Meanwhile, in Europe and Canada, the readers are portable and use secure wireless technology to communicate with the cash registers.

If you’ve travelled outside the US, you’ve probably seen this in action at a restaurant.  The waitperson brings you the reader and your credit card never leaves your eyesight.  That helps keep criminals from using miniaturized swipe-readers to make a copy of the magnetic stripe from the back of your card.

There are other payment card technologies and those can even be used with your cellular phone if it has the right built-in technology.  The most common of these are called [contactless payment systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment). Apple Pay, [Google Pay](https://www.android.com/pay/), and Samsung Pay use such technologies.  To use these, you register your credit cards with the service in a way that’s similar to PayPal.
Some companies offer payment systems that use contactless cards, as well.  You may have seen readers at a gas station or convenience store that have bumps on the top and a graphic symbol of radio waves.
Cards for these systems have chips embedded inside the card and communicate using Radio-Frequency ID (RFID)  Transportation systems, such as subways in major cities, use contactless systems for their access passes.  These are also seen commonly in specific applications such as [payment at gas stations](http://www.cstoredecisions.com/2015/04/01/united-oil-partners-with-kickback-points/) and loyalty card programs. [Some banks and credit-card issuers](http://www.lowcards.com/credit-cards-rfid-13517) use RFID for contactless payments.  Lastly, some organizations issue key-fobs with RFID chips to enable contactless payments such as the [Visa MicroTag](http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/28/visa-rolls-out-paywave-enabled-micro-tag-key-fobs/). Please note that these chips are often embedded in other types of IDs such as driver’s licenses and Department of Homeland Security Global Entry cards.
Hackers steal the information off these cards and devices through [RFID skimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID_skimming). RFID chips are most often powered by the radio waves from the nearby reader.  Using cheap devices, a cybercriminal can get the chip to start broadcasting (remember, it’s transmitting radio frequencies), and then pick up the signals.  The thief needs to be in close proximity with an appropriate reader.  Once remotely activated, the RFID data is remotely read. In fact, this scenario plays out in the young-adult novel *Little Brother* by Corey Doctorow.

Special [Tyvekenvelopes](http://www.amazon.com/Blocking-Passport-Protectors-Protection-Frequency/dp/B00CMAA9X4) can protect individual cards stored in a wallet or purse. Special [RFID-blocking wallets](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-rfid-blocking-wallets-which-should-you-buy/) can protect all your cards plus any RFID-enabled IDs.  However, they will *not* protect the cards should you remove them from the shielded environment, such as when you make a payment or present ID in public.  If you make a purchase with your RFID-enabled credit card at a terminal that only allows swiping, then your information is as vulnerable as ever.

An alternative to RFID cards is to use a service such as Apple Pay or Android Pay on a suitably equipped phone or tablet.  These contactless systems use a different technology called Near-Field-Communications ([NFC](https://support.google.com/androidpay/answer/6224824?hl=en)). NFC is only active when enabled on a smartphone or connected smart-watch. The same size as a credit card, portable wallets such as [COIN](https://onlycoin.com/) allow up to eight credit and debit cards used at contactless terminals as well. Phone and electronic-wallet-based payment systems require very close proximity to the reader, hence the name “Tap-to-Pay.”

Using these systems is simpler than paying with an EMV card, but there are some drawbacks. One popular concern is that a hacker could [pick up the radio signals](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2948212/Will-victim-digital-pickpockets-Hacker-reveals-easy-steal-credit-card-numbers-air-SECONDS.html) between the card and the reader.  The other problem is that you’ll need to shop at merchants who support the technology you’re using, whether it’s Apple Pay or an equivalent. EMV cards may be less convenient, but they will become universal.

Companies and governments use chip cards in other places.  For example, the same technology in the pad on the front of your credit card shows up beneath your picture on a smart-card company ID. In the US, employee badges in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government [are all chip-enabled](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/). When someone steals the data from the magnetic stripe on the back of a credit card, they use a tool called a skimmer to read the contents of the magnetic stripe on the back.  Once hackers have that information, they can perpetrate a number of cybercrimes.  If this is a large-scale theft, as it was in the case of Target, those numbers may be sold on the black market. Individual numbers may be used for more petty crimes such as creating fake credit cards used in unauthorized purchases or ATM withdrawals.

Brian Krebs has created [one of the most informational resources on skimmers](http://krebsonsecurity.com/all-about-skimmers/). In it, he details how hackers plant skimming devices on ATMs and gas pumps. As Mr. Krebs points out, some of these are very sophisticated implementations that even transmit their stolen information over Bluetooth to hacker laptops. 

**So what’s the deal with this liability shift?**

After October 1st 2015, the cost of fraudulent transactions [is borne by merchants](http://www.emv-connection.com/emv-migration-driven-by-payment-brand-milestones/) if they do not use EMV terminals to process transactions.  In other words, whether they have chip readers or not, when they use the card-swipe method to make a sale, they will be liable for any fraudulent transactions.  More specifically, whichever organization has the weakest security is most liable for fraudulent charges.  If a business (restaurant, store, etc.) cannot or does not process fraudulent transactions through the EMV chip, it “eats” the cost.  If a business is ready but the card processor is incapable of completing transactions with the EMV data, they are also liable.

However, if both the company and the card processor can conduct chip card transactions, the cost of fraud falls onto the credit card companies and banks. As a result, it is vital for companies to switch to the chip system and reduce liability.
Most of the world uses a system called “Chip-and-PIN”, where the customer enters their Personal ID Number (PIN) on a keypad when they complete their purchase.  The advantage is that no one is supposed to know the customer’s identifier except for the card owner.  In the United States, most banks program their cards so that **“Chip-and-Signature”** will serve as the standard.  Instead of entering your code on the keypad of the sales terminal, you will be asked to sign a slip or screen just as you do today - if a signature is required at all.

There are two weaknesses inherent in Chip-and-Signature.  First, the credit card may leave the customer’s eyesight, so the magnetic stripe (it’s still there) could be copied using a skimmer. That information can then be used to create fake credit cards.  Next, signatures are rarely checked.  Think about it: can you remember the last time a clerk compared your signature to that on the credit card?
There are places where the chip won’t work.  Gas stations have an extra year to update the card readers at the gas pumps.  Stores and restaurants without EMV readers will need to use the old swipe method to process the information on the back of the credit card.  It will also [take a long time for ATMs](http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/177_177/mastercard-pressures-atm-owners-to-accept-emv-1052579-1.html) to catch up with EMV cards.
On the other hand, there are situations where the magnetic stripe cards won’t work.  Examples include buying fare-cards on the Montreal Metro -- the automated sales machines simply don’t have the equipment to read old-style cards.  Kiosks in airports in the United Kingdom are similarly configured.
The magnetic strip (and its data) are susceptible to several kinds of attack.  First, hackers can clone the information and copy it onto new credit cards.  These credit cards may be so-called “white plastic” that are the same weight-and-shape-and-thickness of a regular credit card for use in ATMs.  The data may be used on a real credit card with its magnetic stripe data overwritten with the information from a credit fraud victim.  Without EMV, any transaction swiped with these cards would appear legitimate.
The relatively obvious other risk from the magnetic strip on credit cards is illicit use.  If a credit card is lost or stolen, then the thief can use it to carry out purchases until the owner reports it missing to the issuing company.  With Chip-and-PIN, the thief wouldn’t be able to use the card because they don’t know the appropriate code.  With Chip-and-Signature though, validation that the customer is legitimate. For small purchases, stores may not even ask for the most rudimentary signature check.
Lastly, in the case of a stolen or lost wallet, the criminal may obtain information needed for unattended purchases.  Gas pumps, for example, often require the buyer to enter their billing zip code.  If a crook gains access to the victim’s wallet, then the rightful owner’s personal data may be on their driver’s license or other document.  This makes the ZIP code check only partially useful.
Broadly speaking, we can divide credit-card fraud into two categories: card-present and card-not-present.  In the former, the criminal has something that works like the real credit card.  For the latter, the criminal simply uses the number, either online or person-to-person.
Magnetic Stripe Weaknesses
Before he worked with the FBI and prior to his famous [TJ Maxx hacks](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Hacker-t.html), Albert Gonzalez was a petty crook who made his living using fake credit cards that he manufactured with information from legitimate accounts stolen and sold in criminal “carder” forums. Hackers skimmed innocent victims’ account information or stole it from databases on the Internet. Then Gonzalez (and other criminals) manufactured white plastic to use at ATMs or to complete transactions.  When he was arrested the first time, Gonzalez was “cashing out” the cards by withdrawing money from ATMs on multiple accounts and harvesting the funds.
Fraudsters used credit card information [stolen from Target’s cash registers](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/ram-scrapers-how-they-work/) to obtain the information from the magnetic strips, effectively the same as using a skimmer. This information, sold on the black market, was used to forge credit cards or to make purchases on the Internet.
Gonzales’ use of forged cards is considered card-present crime because the white plastic replaced the real debit or credit instrument, which remained in the possession of the legitimate cardholder.
EMV helps prevent this because [the chips can’t be forged](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fraudsters-still-clone-credit-cards-keep-plastic-in-your-pocket/). Any business that requires the use of chip-cards ensures that cybercriminals cannot use cards with fake magnetic stripes. While the issuing banks control whether an authorization for an EMV card comes from Chip-and-Signature, or Chip-and-PIN, the merchant and card processing service must be able to handle the transaction. 
EMV cards protect against two kinds of fraud.  The first is when the criminal (such as Albert Gonzales) uses a forged card to make purchases or ATM withdrawals.  The criminal’s fake card must have a forged magnetic stripe on the back to work, which they create using stolen credit or debit card data; hackers can buy that on the Internet. Skimmers (which we will discuss below) steal the magnetic stripe data from the back of the card.
However, if point-of-sale systems and their related back-end processing can’t handle the EMV enabled cards, customers are back to the vulnerable swipe method to pay for purchases. As of May 2016, your author is seeing payment terminals at grocery stores and other places where the establishment blocked (taped over) the chip-slot. Often, despite years of warnings, the company’s software hasn’t been adequately updated.
Once the use of EMV cards supersedes the use of magnetic-stripe, the problem of criminals with forged cards will largely dissipate. The real-world problem is that EMV cards will need to use the magnetic-stripe [as a backup](https://help.payleven.co.uk/does-chip-pin-reader-have-backup-solution-case-customers-chip-card-cannot-be-read-or-card-does-not) for the foreseeable future.
Criminals can steal a debit or credit card, or they may find one lost by the rightful owner.  The crook may then be able to use it to make purchases. We’ll call this a “card-present” transaction as well.  Depending on how the card is used, the stolen card may not require any authentication.  Often, small transactions at locations such as convenience stores don’t require any validation because the purchase is approved automatically.  
Depending on how the EMV chip is implemented, the only thing that may be protected is the account information.  With Chip-and-Signature, the criminal can simply put a fake scrawl where the rightful owner would sign.  Companies accepting credit cards are not allowed to ask for ID if a card is signed because they are supposed to compare the signature on the back of the card to the charge slip.  Visa’s rules, for example, [dictate](https://consumerist.com/2014/07/19/10-answers-to-credit-card-questions-we-get-asked-all-the-time/): “merchants cannot make an ID a condition of acceptance.”  What’s more, a credit card is [technically not valid if unsigned](https://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/pdf/Unsigned_Credit_Cards-(Global).pdf).  The common practice of writing “See ID” often works, but merchants [rarely check](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/sign-or-write-see-ID-1282.php).  Some merchants, such as the United States Postal Service (USPS) may even refuse a card that isn’t signed -- whether or not the signature is legitimate.
Here’s where EMV comes in:  With Chip-and-Signature, the criminals can use the card for small purchases where no verification is needed or put a fake signature on the slip.  In other words, Chip-and-Signature doesn’t prevent this crime.  As implemented outside the United States, Chip-and-PIN protects the consumer and merchant because the criminals won’t know the secret Personal Identification Number.
Cybercriminals can also take stolen credit card information and use it when the card isn’t swiped or dipped.  We call these “card-not-present” transactions.  Often, crooks make these purchases online, such as at an e-commerce site on the Internet.  Committing this fraud requires three -- sometimes more -- pieces of information:  The credit card number, the expiration date, and the CVV (Card Verification Code). Other information may be required, such as the billing postal code or complete address.  For example, these swindles include purchasing expensive products on the Internet and [selling them online or reshipping them to Eastern Europe](https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/radDocs/consumer/ReshippingScam.html).
Obviously, the criminals would need the equivalent information that could be found on the strip and access to the CVV.  Having a stolen card provides this data.  Alternately, someone with a hand-held skimmer could memorize or write down the CVV while stealing the strip’s information.  Hacked cash registers such as the Target registers or those in certain [hotel chains](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/hyatt-card-breach-hit-250-hotels-in-50-nations/) can provide much of this information. Email [“Phishing”](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/phishing-credit-card-scam-fraud-1282.php) scams aimed at collecting cardholder information also serve as a major source of identity information for hackers.
A reasonable person might ask how the criminals get the additional information needed to complete the purchase. The answer: most of what hackers need is available on the Internet.
Sites must be doing something to prevent hackers, right? To prevent these attacks, Amazon, for example, has implemented two other protections.  Whenever a customer enters a new shipping address, Amazon requires re-entry of the credit card number.  Amazon is also moving to [two-factor authentication](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201596330) in which a PIN is sent by text message to the customer’s phone.  Then, the customer must enter the additional security code to complete the purchase.
When the merchant [enters the credit card information manually](http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/credit-card-fraud.htm), we term the activity “card-not-present offline.” **To banks and other card-issuers, these are the most suspicious transactions.** For example, it is common practice to give a credit card number over the phone when making a reservation at a business such as a hotel or order purchases over the telephone.  The consumer has to trust that the person at the other end of the conversation isn’t saving the credit card information.  When hackers possess a card’s number and expiration, then they can simply enter it into the numeric pad of the card-processing terminal.
Hackers typically don’t resort to these to these crimes for two reasons: they are very labor-intensive and they are caught easily by the banks.  As an example, I recently took a taxi, but the driver’s “Square” reader wasn’t working.  The driver typed the credit card number and zip code into the Square App using its keypad.  By the time I’d stepped out of the vehicle, I had already gotten a call from their bank ensuring that the transaction was legitimate.
How EMV Cards Protect Transactions
EMV helps prevent card-not-present fraud for two reasons.  First, RAM scrapers and other malware can’t capture credit card information because it is “tokenized,” and the critical information never leaves the card. If it isn’t transmitted, the information can’t be stolen. Using Chip-and-Dip minimizes the opportunity for someone to steal the strip’s information. And that’s good!
Aside from malware in Point-of-Sale terminals and cash registers, criminals steal the card information using devices called skimmers.  [Easily found on the Internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=hand-held+credit+card+skimmers&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-Address&ie=&oe=&gws_rd=ssl#q=handheld+credit+card+skimmers), these devices allow the criminal to capture the credit card information.  Because of the easy physical access, law enforcement often finds these devices on [ATMs](http://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/atm-skimmer-found-at-port-st-lucie-bank) and [gas pumps](http://www.krdo.com/news/possible-card-skimmer-found-at-colorado-springs-gas-station/36648042). Unfortunately, the deadline for conversion of ATMs to EMV is October 2016 and for gas pumps, October 2017.  In other words, consumers are becoming safer in stores as EMV rolls out, but it will be several years before EMV protection is fully implemented.
Other kinds of Credit Card Fraud
Other kinds of credit card fraud exist. For example, [identity theft can commonly lead to credit card fraud](http://guides.wsj.com/personal-finance/credit/how-to-protect-yourself-from-identity-theft/). In this case, the cybercriminals obtain personal information about the victim including address, date-of-birth, and social security number.  Then, they can apply online for a new credit card in the victim’s name.  This is not restricted to credit cards; the criminals may apply for other kinds of credit including personal and cash loans. 
While [Credit Monitoring](http://www.consumersadvocate.org/id-theft-protection/best-id-theft-protection?matchtype=e&keyword=credit%20monitoring&adpos=1t2&gclid=CLjG84uvvsoCFYQ6aQodza0Hfw) can warn the victim that someone has attempted to open an account, it is up to the individual to contest the newly opened account and any changes to their credit reports. Competent monitoring services [exist online for free](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-monitoring). 
Less convenient is a [Credit Freeze](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs), which blocks all accesses to credit reports.  This will prevent criminals from opening unauthorized accounts. The freeze must be removed if the consumer wants to add a new account.  In other words, a Credit Freeze is more effective, but less convenient.
So-called [“Knuckle-Busters”](http://riskdr.com/2012/07/10/knuckle-busters/) are the old-style imprinters that produce a copy of the face of a credit card including the customer name, number and expiration date.  While rare, these are still in use.  For example, I have seen “knuckle-busters” in taxis where the driver doesn’t have a payment system such as Square or doesn’t want to pay the fees affiliated with external payment. 
This antiquated solution has drawbacks. Even if the merchant is trustworthy, these pose a very large risk because there’s a permanent copy of the purchaser’s information. If it isn’t properly disposed-of, the information stored on these “knuckle-busters” can be stolen by criminals.
Lastly, it’s possible for criminals to force the victim to use his or her credit or debit card in a [store]
(http://wtvr.com/2015/01/22/robber-forces-man-into-martins-at-village-shopping-center-for-cash/) or at [an ATM](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article52147715.html).  While not directly misusing the information from the card, the outcome is stolen money for the victim.
Conclusion
Ultimately, credit card fraud is categorized as an Identity and Authentication Problem: impersonating someone’s identity through unauthorized use of the card number and performing unwanted transactions.  If cybercriminals know a victim’s credit card number and expiration date, they may be able to commit numerous card -present and card-not-present purchases. Knowing the CVV and the cardholder’s personal information (available online) makes the crime easier for the hackers.
EMV cards address many of these risks.  Chip-and-Dip (as well as Tap-to-Pay) ensure that vital credit card information doesn’t get transmitted and, thus, can’t be intercepted.  Chip-and-Signature somewhat addresses the problem of someone creating a fake “white plastic” card to make unauthorized purchases.  If the United States joins much of the rest of the world by switching to Chip-and-PIN, the change will further restrict credit-card theft.
