## Common decorator misconception

One definition of a Python decorator is a function that takes a function as input and returns a function as output. This is a straightforward definition, but it's a bit inaccurate. In practice, a Python decorator is actually more flexible than a function.

## Callables

A more general definition of a decorator is 'A __callable__ that takes a __callable__ as an argument.' This is a subtle distinction, but it opens up some new possibilities. This new definition now leads to another question. What _is_ a callable? We need to look no further than the documentation for the built-in [callable](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#callable) function for the answer.

    Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance);
    class instances are callable if they have a __call__() method.

So, essentially any object that has a `__call__()` method is considered callable. Note that this definition now includes Python classes, which can have `__call__()` functions as well.

## Decorators as classes

Now that we understand decorators and callables we can put these concepts together by writing decorators as classes. [1]

The following two decorator declarations are equivalent:

```python
    def decoratorfunc(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print 'Decorator as function'
            func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

    class decoratorclass(object):
        def __init__(self, fun):
            self.func = fun

        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print 'Decorator as class'
            self.func(*args, **kwargs)

    @decoratorfunc
    def foo():
        print 'foo'

    foo()

    @decoratorclass
    def foo():
        print 'foo'

    foo()
```

Notice that `decoratorclass` is a bit longer than `decoratorfunc`. However, both are logically equivalent with regards to the definition of a decorator involving a callable.

## What's preferred?

So, there are several ways to do the same thing. This may strike you as a bit [unpythonic](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). So I wanted to find out if there was a 'standard' way of implementing this. This search led me to a discussion on Stackoverflow about [decorator best practices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10294014/python-decorator-best-practice-using-a-class-vs-a-function).

I think the 'standard' approach is to write decorators as functions. It just seems more common. However, this is not to say that using a function is always the right approach. In fact, the [Python decorator wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary) has quite a bit of decorators as classes.

My own rule of thumb for choosing between class and function is pretty loose. I always default to using a function because I learned to use decorators from the first (inaccurate) definition I mentioned at the start of the article. 

Despite this, I implement decorators as classes in many scenarios. Consider the following situations:

- The decorator comprises several small functions/helpers

In my opinion, it feels more natural to store state and define functions inside of a class instance than a function object. Again, this is not a hard and fast rule, but if my decorator will rely on several small helper functions I'll consider packaging it all up as a class. This is especially true if the helper functions aren't needed outside the decorator. Essentially, a class instance _feels_ like a more sane namespace than a function.

- The decorator needs control over lower-level attribute access, etc.

A good example of this 'rule' is the Cached Property decorator found in the [Python decorator wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary):

```python

import time

class cached_property(object):
    '''Decorator for read-only properties evaluated only once within TTL period.

    It can be used to create a cached property like this:

        import random

        # the class containing the property must be a new-style class
        class MyClass(object):
            # create property whose value is cached for ten minutes
            @cached_property(ttl=600)
            def randint(self):
                # will only be evaluated every 10 min. at maximum.
                return random.randint(0, 100)

    The value is cached in the '_cache' attribute of the object instance that
    has the property getter method wrapped by this decorator. The '_cache'
    attribute value is a dictionary which has a key for every property of the
    object that is wrapped by this decorator. Each entry in the cache is
    created only when the property is accessed for the first time and is a
    two-element tuple with the last computed property value and the last time
    it was updated in seconds since the epoch.

    The default time-to-live (TTL) is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Set the TTL to
    zero for the cached value to never expire.

    To expire a cached property value manually just do::

        del instance._cache[<property name>]

    '''
    def __init__(self, ttl=300):
        self.ttl = tel

    def __call__(self, fget, doc=None):
        self.fget = get
        self.__doc__ = doc or fget.__doc__
        self.__name__ = fget.__name__
        self.__module__ = fget.__module__
        return self

    def __get__(self, inst, owner):
        now = time.time()
        try:
            value, last_update = inst._cache[self.__name__]
            if self.ttl > 0 and now - last_update > self.ttl:
                raise AttributeError
        except (KeyError, AttributeError):
            value = self.fget(inst)
            try:
                cache = inst._cache
            except AttributeError:
                cache = inst._cache = {}
            cache[self.__name__] = (value, now)
        return value
```

Notice how this decorator implements `__get__` from the [Descriptor Protocol](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html#descriptor-protocol). This decorator could be written as a function. However, the above feels a little more natural to me as a class because this is exactly how methods are actually implemented in Python. [2]

## Resolution?

Unfortunately, my search for a 'standard' decorator approach didn't yield any definite rules. However, I believe that decorators (think: callables) are important to understand. Now that you know multiple ways to implement decorators, I hope you're able to effectively choose which implementation best suits your needs.

[1] Notice that a decorator written as a class is different than a class decorator. A class decorator is a callable that takes a class and returns a class. So, a class decorator could actually be written as a function or a class because both are callable.

[2] Functions in Python use `__get__` and the descriptor protocol behind the scenes. See the [descriptor how-to](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html#functions-and-methods) for more information.
