h4. Setup, Init and Cloning Screencast

I have produced a series of short screencasts demonstrating the topics of several of the chapters in this book so you can see them in practice on a real command line. You should be able to download these movies with this book from the PeepCode website.

The first in this series is _Git Setup, Initialization and Cloning_ and shows you how to setup your Git configuration, how to initialize a new repository and how to clone an existing repository over both the Git transport and the HTTP transport.
