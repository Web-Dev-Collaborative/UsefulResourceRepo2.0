    <h2 id="git-cheat-sheet">Git Cheat Sheet</h2>
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Teams of developers and open-source software maintainers typically manage
      their projects through Git, a distributed version control system that
      supports collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cheat sheet-style guide provides a quick reference to commands that
      are useful for working and collaborating in a Git repository. To install
      and configure Git, be sure to read “<a
        href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-getting-started-with-git"
        >How To Contribute to Open Source: Getting Started with Git</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to Use This Guide:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This guide is in cheat sheet format with self-contained command-line
        snippets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jump to any section that is relevant to the task you are trying to
        complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you see <code>highlighted text</code> in this guide’s commands,
        keep in mind that this text should refer to the commits and files in
        <em>your own</em> repository.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="set-up-and-initialization">Set Up and Initialization</h2>
    <p>
      Check your Git version with the following command, which will also confirm
      that Git is installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can initialize your current working directory as a Git repository with
      <code>init</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To copy an existing Git repository hosted remotely, you’ll use
      <code>git clone</code> with the repo’s URL or server location (in the
      latter case you will use <code>ssh</code>).
    </p>
    <p>Show your current Git directory’s remote repository.</p>
    <p>For a more verbose output, use the <code>-v</code> flag.</p>
    <p>
      Add the Git upstream, which can be a URL or can be hosted on a server (in
      the latter case, connect with <code>ssh</code>).
    </p>
    <h2 id="staging">Staging</h2>
    <p>
      When you’ve modified a file and have marked it to go in your next commit,
      it is considered to be a staged file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check the status of your Git repository, including files added that are
      not staged, and files that are staged.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stage modified files, use the <code>add</code> command, which you can
      run multiple times before a commit. If you make subsequent changes that
      you want included in the next commit, you must run <code>add</code> again.
    </p>
    <p>You can specify the specific file with <code>add</code>.</p>
    <p>
      With <code>.</code> you can add all files in the current directory,
      including files that begin with a <code>.</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to add all files in a current directory as well as files
      in subdirectories, you can use the <code>-all</code> or
      <code>-A</code> flag:
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove a file from staging while retaining changes within your
      working directory with <code>reset</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="committing">Committing</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have staged your updates, you are ready to commit them, which
      will record changes you have made to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      To commit staged files, you’ll run the <code>commit</code> command with
      your meaningful commit message so that you can track commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can condense staging all tracked files with committing them in one
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to modify your commit message, you can do so with the
      <code>--amend</code> flag.
    </p>
    <h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
    <p>
      A branch in Git is a movable pointer to one of the commits in the
      repository, it allows you to isolate work and manage feature development
      and integrations. You can learn more about branches by reading the
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is"
        >Git documentation</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      List all current branches with the <code>branch</code> command. An
      asterisk (<code>*</code>) will appear next to your currently active
      branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new branch. You will remain on your currently active branch until
      you switch to the new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Switch to any existing branch and check it out into your current working
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can consolidate the creation and checkout of a new branch by using the
      <code>-b</code> flag.
    </p>
    <p>Rename your branch name.</p>
    <p>
      Merge the specified branch’s history into the one you’re currently working
      in.
    </p>
    <p>Abort the merge, in case there are conflicts.</p>
    <p>
      You can also select a particular commit to merge with
      <code>cherry-pick</code> with the string that references the specific
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have merged a branch and no longer need the branch, you can
      delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have not merged a branch to main, but are sure you want to delete
      it, you can <strong>force</strong> delete a branch.
    </p>
    <h2 id="collaborate-and-update">Collaborate and Update</h2>
    <p>
      To download changes from another repository, such as the remote upstream,
      you’ll use <code>fetch</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merge the fetched commits. Note that some repositories may use
      <code>master</code> instead of <code>main</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Push or transmit your local branch commits to the remote repository
      branch.
    </p>
    <p>Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.</p>
    <h2 id="inspecting">Inspecting</h2>
    <p>Display the commit history for the currently active branch.</p>
    <p>
      Show the commits that changed a particular file. This follows the file
      regardless of file renaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show the commits that are on one branch and not on the other. This will
      show commits on <code>a-branch</code> that are not on
      <code>b-branch</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at reference logs (<code>reflog</code>) to see when the tips of
      branches and other references were last updated within the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show any object in Git via its commit string or hash in a more
      human-readable format.
    </p>
    <h2 id="show-changes">Show Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>git diff</code> command shows changes between commits, branches,
      and more. You can read more fully about it through the
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">Git documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Compare modified files that are on the staging area.</p>
    <p>
      Display the diff of what is in <code>a-branch</code> but is not in
      <code>b-branch</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Show the diff between two specific commits.</p>
    <h2 id="stashing">Stashing</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you’ll find that you made changes to some code, but before you
      finish you have to begin working on something else. You’re not quite ready
      to commit the changes you have made so far, but you don’t want to lose
      your work. The <code>git stash</code> command will allow you to save your
      local modifications and revert back to the working directory that is in
      line with the most recent <code>HEAD</code> commit.
    </p>
    <p>Stash your current work.</p>
    <p>See what you currently have stashed.</p>
    <p>
      Your stashes will be named <code>stash@{0}</code>, <code>stash@{1}</code>,
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>Show information about a particular stash.</p>
    <p>
      To bring the files in a current stash out of the stash while still
      retaining the stash, use <code>apply</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to bring files out of a stash, and no longer need the stash,
      use <code>pop</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you no longer need the files saved in a particular stash, you can
      <code>drop</code> the stash.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have multiple stashes saved and no longer need to use any of them,
      you can use <code>clear</code> to remove them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ignoring-files">Ignoring Files</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to keep files in your local Git directory, but do not want to
      commit them to the project, you can add these files to your
      <code>.gitignore</code> file so that they do not cause conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use a text editor such as nano to add files to the
      <code>.gitignore</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see examples of <code>.gitignore</code> files, you can look at GitHub’s
      <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore"
        ><code>.gitignore</code> template repo</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rebasing">Rebasing</h2>
    <p>
      A rebase allows us to move branches around by changing the commit that
      they are based on. With rebasing, you can squash or reword commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can start a rebase by either calling the number of commits you have
      made that you want to rebase (<code>5</code> in the case below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can rebase based on a particular commit string or hash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have squashed or reworded commits, you can complete the rebase of
      your branch on top of the latest version of the project’s upstream code.
      Note that some repositories may use <code>master</code> instead of
      <code>main</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more about rebasing and updating, you can read
      <a
        href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rebase-and-update-a-pull-request"
        >How To Rebase and Update a Pull Request</a
      >, which is also applicable to any type of commit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reverting-and-resetting">Reverting and Resetting</h2>
    <p>
      You can revert back the changes that you made on a given commit by using
      <code>revert</code>. Your working tree will need to be clean in order for
      this to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, including after a rebase, you need to reset your working tree.
      You can reset to a particular commit, and
      <strong>delete all changes</strong>, with the following command.
    </p>
    <p>
      To force push your last known non-conflicting commit to the origin
      repository, you’ll need to use <code>--force</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning</strong>: Force pushing to the main (sometimes
      <code>master</code>) branch is often frowned upon unless there is a really
      important reason for doing it. Use sparingly when working on your own
      repositories, and work to avoid this when you’re collaborating.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remove local untracked files and subdirectories from the Git directory
      for a clean working branch, you can use <code>git clean</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to modify your local repository so that it looks like the
      current upstream main branch (that is, there are too many conflicts), you
      can perform a hard reset.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: Performing this command will make your local
      repository look exactly like the upstream. Any commits you have made but
      that were not pulled into the upstream <strong>will be destroyed</strong>.
    </p>
