    <p>
      Technically, your mind isn’t a muscle. But it can still grow and learn
      from training.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, your mind is plastic. The neural networks in your brain change
      through growth and reorganization.
    </p>
    <p>We all know this from experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learning a new skill is only possible when new neural connections are
        formed in your brain
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeated practice makes us better in a particular task — how? By
        strengthening the neural connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environmental influences change our behavior and how we think — again
        for the same reason.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For most of us, the highest period of neuroplasticity happens in our
      childhood. That’s when we’re making sense of the world and learning at a
      massive rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as we grow up, that spirit somehow gets lost. We stop learning as
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientists too thought neuroplasticity manifests only during the early
      years of a human. But research in the latter half of the 20th century
      showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered even through
      adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s see how you can bring that sort of magic back into your lives.</p>
    <p>
      A fit brain is resilient, prone to fewer diseases, and slows down its
      cognitive decline. Of course, as a result of a better brain, you get
      higher concentration, awareness, focus, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why many computer-based training programs have emerged to train
      the brain. And it’s no joke — it’s a billion-dollar industry.
    </p>
    <p>But brain growth is not about downloading an app on your smartphone.</p>
    <p>
      In fact,
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629869/"
        >research</a
      >
      suggests that playing such games to improve your brain may not be
      effective at all. All it may do at the end of the day is to improve your
      performance at that game.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, another
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701915/"
        >research</a
      >
      does tell us what slows cognitive decline— lifestyle changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These include creative pursuits, learning new skills, having healthy
      social interactions, and so on. And they are arguably more effective than
      any smartphone game when it comes to training your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, building your own mental gym requires you to make a few tweaks
      to your life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-to-approach-brain-training">How to approach brain training</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve long sought different techniques to upgrade my brain, even when I was
      8 years old. I did sudoku puzzles with my grandfather every day. Then, I
      started playing scrabble and other brain games.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were all fine and dandy. But it wasn’t going to make me a genius —
      because apart from the game, I spent all my time watching TV, playing
      mobile games, and eating chips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like physical training, brain training is a 24/7 activity. Just as
      physical training requires not only a workout but also proper nutrition
      and sleep, brain training needs round-the-clock care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take for instance meditation. Many people take up meditation to improve
      their concentration and awareness. They set aside ten minutes every day
      for their practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as their session is over, they come back to their restless
      state of being. They rush through their work and are distracted all day
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not enough. You don’t do a single workout and then eat burgers all
      day long right? Similarly, you need to (in this case) make sure to carry
      that state of heightened awareness in everything you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a broader level, you need to constantly ask yourself if what you’re
      doing is training your mind for the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question needs to be running at the back of your mind so you can
      catch yourself slacking off.
    </p>
    <p>That said, let’s see specific ways you can train your brain.</p>
    <p>
      These are the basics of health and personal improvement. I’m guessing you
      already know the value of sleep and exercise.
    </p>
    <p>A couple of points about nutrition:</p>
    <p>
      Your brain needs you to eat healthy fats. Focus on fish oils from wild
      salmon, nuts such as walnuts, seeds such as flaxseed and olive oil. Eat
      more of these foods and less saturated fats. An
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/"
        >Omega-3 rich diet promotes better brain function.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once you implement these three can you think about other ways of
      improving your brain.
    </p>
    <p>

        your own peril.</strong

    </p>
    <p>
      If someone asks me for one habit that I’d give to someone struggling to
      get his life together, it would be meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meditating for just 10 minutes per day will change the brain in only 8
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to a famous
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/">study</a>
      in <em>NeuroReport,</em> which I describe in detail in my
      <a href="http://bit.ly/30shivam">book</a><em>,</em> meditation is directly
      linked with increased cortical thickness in the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in a 2012
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289949/">study</a>,
      researchers compared brain images from 50 adults who meditate and 50
      adults who don’t meditate. Results suggested that people who practiced
      meditation for many years have more folds in the outer layer of the brain.
      This process (called gyrification) increases the brain’s ability to
      process information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312586/"
        >Meditation strengthens the left hippocampus</a
      >, which helps us learn new things, improves memory, and contributes to
      emotional regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also enhances present moment awareness by
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250176/"
        >building density in the posterior cingulate</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started meditating two years ago on my own. After 6 months I realized
      the need of learning proper techniques and being more regular. Going to a
      meditation class was the best thing I’d done for my brain and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying that my life changed would be an understatement. There’s no word I
      can think of to describe the transformation I’ve gone through.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve become calmer, productive, God-remembering, and blissful.</p>
    <p>
      My past-self wouldn’t have believed these facts. But it’s possible — for
      me and for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more you meditate, the more you’ll find these benefits sticking around
      even when you’re not meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s absolutely no reason you shouldn’t

      In simple terms, you challenge your brain when you learn something new.
      You form new neural pathways and connections in your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact,
      <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613499592"
        >research</a

      shows that it’s one of the best ways to keep your brain sharp. It may also
      help you

    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve never been satisfied with doing one thing in life. It’s not that I’m
      distracted. It’s that I’m always looking for ways to break out of
      complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a kid, I learned to play tabla and many other percussion instruments,
      keyboard, did theatre, debating, public speaking, performed at musical
      events, and so on. I sought much more than the monotony of my textbooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In college, I studied accounting, economics, and business. I learned to
      code and built my own startup to work with national clients. I worked with
      two other startups after that. This was also the time when I got seriously
      into meditation. And at the moment, I’m devoted to writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to brag (and I hope writing this doesn’t fuel my ego). The
      point is that the more you learn the sharper your brain will become.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will push you to learn more things. It’s a positive, upward wave that
      you want to ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How can you implement this in your life?</strong> There’s not much
      thinking to do— just get started with anything new that interests you.
      Read a book, listen to a podcast, watch a TED talk, learn a new
      instrument, etc.
    </p>
    <p>You just need to get started. Life will take care of itself soon.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623380">Science</a> shows
      that practicing activities like music, drawing, arts and crafts stimulate
      our brain in a way that enhances our health and well-being. These

      There’s a psychological satisfaction in creating. If you’ve ever created
      something you know what I’m talking about.

      Yes, it can be a struggle. But all those times of struggle seem worth it
      when the final result is in front of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creativity is the number one skill people are looking for in every field.
      And there’s good news —

        >it can come from practice</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing and music (playing instruments) are my forms of creative
      expression. Plus, they make me a good thinker and problem solver. The more
      you create, the more your brain improves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s no mystery that the best people in any profession have at least one
      other hobby they’re seriously devoted to. Think about Einstein with his
      piano and Churchill with his

      Creativity increases cognitive flexibility which is the brain’s ability to
      hold opposing ideas together. This skill helps you to navigate stress
      better and find effective solutions to problems in life.

        >power of boredom</a
      >
      is amazing if you let it enter your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly, most of us spend our free time trying to escape that feeling.
      Examples include mindlessly scrolling social media, binge-watching,
      gossiping, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is, we have an ever-increasing amount of novelty around us.
      Centuries ago, if I was bored, well, I was bored. I had no choice. It’s
      just a fact of life. Every moment of life was not supposed to be filled
      with something exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you embrace boredom, you embrace the uncomfortable feeling of being
      alone. You embrace the stillness that comes when you’re devoid of constant
      stimuli.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stillness is priceless. It teaches you to be focused and
      concentrated. Plus, that’s where all your ideas actually come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distractions like TV, Netflix, games, and social media are
      pseudo-relaxers. You may think you’re relaxing, but in the end, you become
      numb to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boredom is real relaxation. It helps your brain reset and come out
      stronger on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, it’s a must-have lifestyle habit in your efforts to train
      your mind.

    <p>
      Jesus said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Because when you
      think of others, you feel better. When you think only of yourself, you
      reinforce negative, egoic qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the needs of others in front of us makes us happy and gives us a
      sense of purpose. Plus, it releases oxytocin which combats inflammation
      and stress.

    <p>
      Kindness strengthens your whole being — physical, mental, emotional, and
      spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Related to kindness is another trait that can make or break your wellbeing
      — forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can reap huge rewards for
      your health, lowering the risk of a heart attack; improving cholesterol
      levels and sleep; and reducing pain,
      <a

        >blood pressure</a
      >, and levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. And research points to
      an increase in the forgiveness-health connection as you age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a small argument with your spouse or a big fight at work, an
      unresolved conflict goes deeper inside you than you can imagine. There’s
      an enormous emotional, physical, and spiritual burden in being hurt and
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all need to learn to let go. To offer our love and compassion, first to
      ourselves, and then to those who hurt us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, just like the unresolved conflict created a ruckus inside you,
      forgiveness will help you soar in the heavens of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more you practice kindness and forgiveness, the happier you get. That,
      above all, has more impact on your brain than you know.

    <p>
      The average person watches more than four hours of television every day.
      It doesn’t take a lot of science for you to know it’s bad for your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people only focus on the opportunity cost of time spent watching TV.
      Yes, that’s a valid point — you could’ve spent that time exercising,
      reading, or spending time with family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there’s another reason why I try to cut down on TV. It hurts your
      concentration big time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about it. To concentrate you need to focus on one thing for a long
      period of time. But when you watch TV, the scene changes every two
      seconds. Even the audio and songs are fast-paced that get you excited
      instead of keeping you calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might be tempted to think that it’s a good way to relax. But you are
      not relaxing — your mind is still receiving stimuli from the TV. You are
      processing information and reacting emotionally.

      Find healthier ways to relax that will at least not harm your brain
      directly.

    </p>
    <p>
      When you ruminate, you’re much less likely to think about the award you
      won last year but about all the things wrong with life. From then on, you
      get caught in a downward spiral of negativity that can seriously hurt your
      mood and affect your life.

      This, like everything else, is a mental habit. Which means you can change
      it. How?

      The next time you catch yourself ruminating, bring your attention back to
      the present. If you’re meditating, this would be easier.

      the sooner you’ll see the benefits.

        “What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance
        to what already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life
        itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to
        life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than
        against you.”

      Humans have a quirky need to control everything. We try to control
      circumstances, situations, and others’ behavior. But that’s a one-way
      ticket to the land of stress and anxiety.

      It’s hard to surrender because our egos get in between. We want to feel
      important and in control. We want to feel we’re the captain of our ship.

      But, my friend, that’s just not true. Whether you believe in a higher
      power or not doesn’t matter. It makes sense logically. 99.999% of the
      things in this world happen without you doing anything. To think that you
      can somehow exert your own will over what life has in store for you is
      absurd.

      I’m not telling you to go become a hermit and sit in a room contemplating
      all day.

      Instead, make it a point to let go of your likes, dislikes, and reactions.
      Face the world with complete acceptance.

      Think of it like this. The river of life has a flow. It has a flow defined
      for our collective lives as well as our individual lives. Try to see the
      direction of the flow and find ways to move along with it.

      In simpler words, see what’s trying to happen and then put out the energy
      to make that happen.

      You can only know this with the power of intuition. God will not scream
      out of the sky to tell you what you should do. And the only way to develop
      that intuition is through meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you try to flow with life more and more, you’ll be exponentially
      happier and the road will be easier.
