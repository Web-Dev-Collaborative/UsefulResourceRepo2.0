      This overview covers the difference between <strong>blocking</strong> and
      <strong>non-blocking</strong> calls in Node.js. This overview will refer
      to the event loop and libuv but no prior knowledge of those topics is
      required. Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of the
      JavaScript language and Node.js

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Blocking</strong> is when the execution of additional JavaScript
      in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation
      completes. This happens because the event loop is unable to continue
      running JavaScript while a <strong>blocking</strong> operation is
      occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Node.js, JavaScript that exhibits poor performance due to being CPU
      intensive rather than waiting on a non-JavaScript operation, such as I/O,
      isn’t typically referred to as <strong>blocking</strong>. Synchronous
      methods in the Node.js standard library that use libuv are the most
      commonly used <strong>blocking</strong> operations. Native modules may
      also have <strong>blocking</strong> methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the I/O methods in the Node.js standard library provide
      asynchronous versions, which are <strong>non-blocking</strong>, and accept
      callback functions. Some methods also have
      <strong>blocking</strong> counterparts, which have names that end with
      <code>Sync</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blocking</strong> methods execute
      <strong>synchronously</strong> and <strong>non-blocking</strong> methods
      execute <strong>asynchronously</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the File System module as an example, this is a
      <strong>synchronous</strong> file read:
    </p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
const data = fs.readFileSync(&#39;/file.md&#39;);</code></pre>
    <p>And here is an equivalent <strong>asynchronous</strong> example:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
fs.readFile(&#39;/file.md&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err;
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      The first example appears simpler than the second but has the disadvantage
      of the second line <strong>blocking</strong> the execution of any
      additional JavaScript until the entire file is read. Note that in the
      synchronous version if an error is thrown it will need to be caught or the
      process will crash. In the asynchronous version, it is up to the author to
      decide whether an error should throw as shown.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s expand our example a little bit:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
const data = fs.readFileSync(&#39;/file.md&#39;);
console.log(data);
moreWork();</code></pre>
    <p>And here is a similar, but not equivalent asynchronous example:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
fs.readFile(&#39;/file.md&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
moreWork();</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the first example above, <code>console.log</code> will be called before
      <code>moreWork()</code>. In the second example
      <code>fs.readFile()</code> is <strong>non-blocking</strong> so JavaScript
      execution can continue and <code>moreWork()</code> will be called first.
      The ability to run <code>moreWork()</code> without waiting for the file
      read to complete is a key design choice that allows for higher throughput.
    </p>

      Concurrency and Throughput<a href="#concurrency-and-throughput"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript execution in Node.js is single threaded, so concurrency refers
      to the event loop’s capacity to execute JavaScript callback functions
      after completing other work. Any code that is expected to run in a
      concurrent manner must allow the event loop to continue running as
      non-JavaScript operations, like I/O, are occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, let’s consider a case where each request to a web server
      takes 50ms to complete and 45ms of that 50ms is database I/O that can be
      done asynchronously. Choosing <strong>non-blocking</strong> asynchronous
      operations frees up that 45ms per request to handle other requests. This
      is a significant difference in capacity just by choosing to use
      <strong>non-blocking</strong> methods instead of
      <strong>blocking</strong> methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event loop is different than models in many other languages where
      additional threads may be created to handle concurrent work.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dangers-of-mixing-blocking-and-non-blocking-code">
      Dangers of Mixing Blocking and Non-Blocking Code<a
        href="#dangers-of-mixing-blocking-and-non-blocking-code"
      ></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are some patterns that should be avoided when dealing with I/O.
      Let’s look at an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
fs.readFile(&#39;/file.md&#39;, (err, data) =&gt; {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
fs.unlinkSync(&#39;/file.md&#39;);</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the above example, <code>fs.unlinkSync()</code> is likely to be run
      before <code>fs.readFile()</code>, which would delete
      <code>file.md</code> before it is actually read. A better way to write
      this, which is completely <strong>non-blocking</strong> and guaranteed to
      execute in the correct order is:
    </p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
fs.readFile(&#39;/file.md&#39;, (readFileErr, data) =&gt; {
  if (readFileErr) throw readFileErr;
  console.log(data);
  fs.unlink(&#39;/file.md&#39;, (unlinkErr) =&gt; {
    if (unlinkErr) throw unlinkErr;
  });
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      The above places a <strong>non-blocking</strong> call to
      <code>fs.unlink()</code> within the callback of
      <code>fs.readFile()</code> which guarantees the correct order of
      operations.
