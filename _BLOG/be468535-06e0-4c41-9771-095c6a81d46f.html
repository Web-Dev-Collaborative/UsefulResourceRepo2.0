      <em>SOLID</em> is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design
      (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Uncle Bob</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> While these principles can apply to various
      programming languages, the sample code contained in this article will use
      PHP.
    </p>
    <p>
      These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with
      considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows.
      Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells,
      refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
    </p>
    <p>SOLID stands for:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>
      In this article, you will be introduced to each principle individually to
      understand how SOLID can help make you a better developer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="single-responsibility-principle">
      Single-Responsibility Principle
    </h2>
    <p>Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a
        class should have only one job.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For example, consider an application that takes a collection of
      shapes—circles, and squares—and calculates the sum of the area of all the
      shapes in the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, create the shape classes and have the constructors set up the
      required parameters.
    </p>
    <p>For squares, you will need to know the <code>length</code> of a side:</p>
    <p>For circles, you will need to know the <code>radius</code>:</p>
    <p>
      Next, create the <code>AreaCalculator</code> class and then write up the
      logic to sum up the areas of all provided shapes. The area of a square is
      calculated by length squared. The area of a circle is calculated by pi
      times radius squared.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the <code>AreaCalculator</code> class, you will need to instantiate
      the class and pass in an array of shapes and display the output at the
      bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example with a collection of three shapes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a circle with a radius of 2</li>
      <li>a square with a length of 5</li>
      <li>a second square with a length of 6</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem with the output method is that the
      <code>AreaCalculator</code> handles the logic to output the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a scenario where the output should be converted to another format
      like JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the logic would be handled by the
      <code>AreaCalculator</code> class. This would violate the
      single-responsibility principle. The <code>AreaCalculator</code> class
      should only be concerned with the sum of the areas of provided shapes. It
      should not care whether the user wants JSON or HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this, you can create a separate
      <code>SumCalculatorOutputter</code> class and use that new class to handle
      the logic you need to output the data to the user:
    </p>
    <p>The <code>SumCalculatorOutputter</code> class would work like this:</p>
    <p>
      Now, the logic you need to output the data to the user is handled by the
      <code>SumCalculatorOutputter</code> class.
    </p>
    <p>That satisfies the single-responsibility principle.</p>
    <h2 id="open-closed-principle">Open-Closed Principle</h2>
    <p>Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for
        modification.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s revisit the <code>AreaCalculator</code> class and focus on the
      <code>sum</code> method:
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a scenario where the user would like the <code>sum</code> of
      additional shapes like triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc. You would have
      to constantly edit this file and add more <code>if</code>/<code
        >else</code
      >
      blocks. That would violate the open-closed principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A way you can make this <code>sum</code> method better is to remove the
      logic to calculate the area of each shape out of the
      <code>AreaCalculator</code> class method and attach it to each shape’s
      class.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the <code>area</code> method defined in <code>Square</code>:</p>
    <p>
      And here is the <code>area</code> method defined in <code>Circle</code>:
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>sum</code> method for <code>AreaCalculator</code> can then be
      rewritten as:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you can create another shape class and pass it in when calculating
      the sum without breaking the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, another problem arises. How do you know that the object passed
      into the <code>AreaCalculator</code> is actually a shape or if the shape
      has a method named <code>area</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding to an
      <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php"
        >interface</a
      >
      is an integral part of SOLID.
    </p>
    <p>Create a <code>ShapeInterface</code> that supports <code>area</code>:</p>
    <p>
      Modify your shape classes to <code>implement</code> the
      <code>ShapeInterface</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the update to <code>Square</code>:</p>
    <p>And here is the update to <code>Circle</code>:</p>
    <p>
      In the <code>sum</code> method for <code>AreaCalculator</code>, you can
      check if the shapes provided are actually instances of the
      <code>ShapeInterface</code>; otherwise, throw an exception:
    </p>
    <p>That satisfies the open-closed principle.</p>
    <h2 id="liskov-substitution-principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>
    <p>Liskov Substitution Principle states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y)
        should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable
      for their base or parent class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building off the example <code>AreaCalculator</code> class, consider a new
      <code>VolumeCalculator</code> class that extends the
      <code>AreaCalculator</code> class:
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that the <code>SumCalculatorOutputter</code> class resembles this:
    </p>
    <p>If you tried to run an example like this:</p>
    <p>
      When you call the <code>HTML</code> method on the
      <code>$output2</code> object, you will get an <code>E_NOTICE</code> error
      informing you of an array to string conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix this, instead of returning an array from the
      <code>VolumeCalculator</code> class sum method, return
      <code>$summedData</code>:
    </p>
    <p>The <code>$summedData</code> can be a float, double or integer.</p>
    <p>That satisfies the Liskov substitution principle.</p>
    <h2 id="interface-segregation-principle">
      Interface Segregation Principle
    </h2>
    <p>Interface segregation principle states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it
        doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do
        not use.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Still building from the previous <code>ShapeInterface</code> example, you
      will need to support the new three-dimensional shapes of
      <code>Cuboid</code> and <code>Spheroid</code>, and these shapes will need
      to also calculate <code>volume</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s consider what would happen if you were to modify the
      <code>ShapeInterface</code> to add another contract:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, any shape you create must implement the <code>volume</code> method,
      but you know that squares are flat shapes and that they do not have
      volumes, so this interface would force the <code>Square</code> class to
      implement a method that it has no use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would violate the interface segregation principle. Instead, you could
      create another interface called
      <code>ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface</code> that has the
      <code>volume</code> contract and three-dimensional shapes can implement
      this interface:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a much better approach, but a pitfall to watch out for is when
      type-hinting these interfaces. Instead of using a
      <code>ShapeInterface</code> or a
      <code>ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface</code>, you can create another
      interface, maybe <code>ManageShapeInterface</code>, and implement it on
      both the flat and three-dimensional shapes.
    </p>
    <p>This way, you can have a single API for managing the shapes:</p>
    <p>
      Now in <code>AreaCalculator</code> class, you can replace the call to the
      <code>area</code> method with <code>calculate</code> and also check if the
      object is an instance of the <code>ManageShapeInterface</code> and not the
      <code>ShapeInterface</code>.
    </p>
    <p>That satisfies the interface segregation principle.</p>
    <h2 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>
    <p>Dependency inversion principle states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that
        the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they
        should depend on abstractions.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This principle allows for decoupling.</p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a <code>PasswordReminder</code> that connects to a
      MySQL database:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the <code>MySQLConnection</code> is the low-level module while the
      <code>PasswordReminder</code> is high level, but according to the
      definition of <strong>D</strong> in SOLID, which states to
      <em>Depend on abstraction, not on concretions</em>. This snippet above
      violates this principle as the <code>PasswordReminder</code> class is
      being forced to depend on the <code>MySQLConnection</code> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, if you were to change the database engine, you would also have to
      edit the <code>PasswordReminder</code> class, and this would violate the
      <em>open-close principle</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>PasswordReminder</code> class should not care what database your
      application uses. To address these issues, you can code to an interface
      since high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstraction:
    </p>
    <p>
      The interface has a connect method and the
      <code>MySQLConnection</code> class implements this interface. Also,
      instead of directly type-hinting <code>MySQLConnection</code> class in the
      constructor of the <code>PasswordReminder</code>, you instead type-hint
      the <code>DBConnectionInterface</code> and no matter the type of database
      your application uses, the <code>PasswordReminder</code> class can connect
      to the database without any problems and open-close principle is not
      violated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code establishes that both the high-level and low-level modules
      depend on abstraction.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, you were presented with the five principles of SOLID
      Code. Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with
      collaborators, extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer
      complications.
