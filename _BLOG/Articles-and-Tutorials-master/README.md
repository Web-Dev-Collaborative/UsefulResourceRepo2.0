# DigitalOcean Articles & Tutorials

One of DigitalOcean’s articulated goals is to build up a large, comprehensive, and beautifully written collection of tutorials. Because documentation often gets out-of-date quickly, this repo exists to allow the DigitalOcean Community to help keep it up to date!

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). _See_ [Markdown Intro.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/).
