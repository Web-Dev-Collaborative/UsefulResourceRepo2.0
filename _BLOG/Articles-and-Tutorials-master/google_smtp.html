<h1>How to Configure Google's SMTP Server on a Digitalocean Cloud Server</h1>

Do you need to send e-mail from your DigitalOcean droplet? A little-known
feature about Gmail and Google Apps e-mail is Google's portable SMTP server.
Instead of having to manage your own outgoing mail server on your DigitalOcean
droplet, you can simply configure Google's SMTP server settings into whatever
script or program you wish to send e-mail from. All you need is either a (i)

account.

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<hr />

In using Google's SMTP server in this manner (outside of Gmail's web interface),
you have the option of having Google store and index the e-mails you send via
its SMTP server, so all your sent e-mails will be searchable and backed-up on
Google's servers. If you elect to use your Gmail or Google Apps account for your
incoming e-mail as well, you'll have all your e-mail in one convenient place. In
addition, since Google's SMTP server does not use Port 25, you'll reduce the
probability that an ISP might block your e-mail or flag it as spam.

<h2>Settings</h2>
<hr />

<p>
  Google's SMTP server <strong>requires authentication</strong>, so here's how
  to set it up:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Server address<br />(i.e., outgoing mail):</td>
    <td><strong>smtp.gmail.com</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Username:</td>
    <td>
      <strong
        >Your <strong>full</strong> Gmail or Google Apps e-mail address</strong
      ><br />(e.g. example@gmail.com or example@yourdomain.com)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Password:</td>
    <td><strong>Your Gmail or Google Apps e-mail password</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Port:</td>
    <td><strong>465</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TLS/SSL required?:</td>
    <td><strong>yes</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  In order to store a copy of outgoing e-mails in your Gmail or Google Apps
  <i>Sent</i> folder, log into your Gmail or Google Apps e-mail
  <i>Settings</i> and:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the <i>Forwarding/IMAP</i> tab; and</li>
  <li>scroll down to the <i>IMAP Access</i> section;</li>
  <li>
    IMAP must be <strong>enabled</strong> in order for e-mails to be properly
    copied to your <i>Sent</i> folder.
  </li>
</ol>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Google automatically rewrites the FROM: field of any
e-mail you send via its SMTP server to the default
<strong>Send mail as</strong> e-mail address in your Gmail or Google Apps e-mail
account <i>Settings</i>. You need to be aware of this nuance because it affects
the presentation of your e-mail, from the point of view of the recepient, and it
may also affect the Reply-To setting of some programs.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Workaround:</strong> In your Google e-mail <i>Settings</i>, go to
    the <i>Accounts</i> tab/section and make "default" an account other than
    your Gmail account. This will cause Google's SMTP server to re-write the
    FROM: field with whatever address you enabled as the default
    <strong>Send mail as</strong> address.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sending Limits</h2>
<hr />

Google limits the amount of mail a user can send, via its portable SMTP server.
This limit restricts the number of messages sent per day to 99 e-mails; and the
restriction is automatically removed within 24 hours after the limit was
reached.
