      When I
      <a href="https://stackify.com/learn-nodejs-tutorials/"
        >started out in Node.js,</a
      >
      I remember being struck by the weird-looking module.exports code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what it was, and where it came from, and why it wasn’t declared
      in the file. What <em>was</em> this magic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Today we’re going to find out. We’ll demystify this somewhat odd-looking
      feature of Node.js. By the end of this article, you should be comfortable
      not only using the syntax, but also understanding what it actually does
      under the hood. To round it all off, we’ll go through some best practices
      for using module exporting to break down and give your application some
      great structure.
    </p>
    <p>Sound good to you? Let’s dive in!</p>
    <h3 id="whats-a-module-anyway">What’s a module, anyway?</h3>
    <p>
      The first question to answer when we’re discussing module exports is the
      first part, the module. What is it? And why should we care about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple terms, a module is code that we group together for the purposes
      of sharing and reuse. Modules, therefore, allow us to break down
      complexity in our applications into small chunks. This can help with
      understanding the code right down to
      <a href="https://stackify.com/node-js-debugging-tips/"
        >finding and fixing bugs</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>Fairly straightforward, right?</p>
    <p>
      Now that you know what modules are, let’s see how they’re
      used—specifically—in Node.js.
    </p>
    <h3 id="modules-in-javascript-explained">
      Modules in JavaScript explained
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before we get to how modules are handled in Node.js, I want to take a
      moment to clarify the different conflicting and confusing alternate module
      systems in the JavaScript ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might’ve heard of some of them: CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS, UMD… Ugh,
      it’s all very confusing. Which one should you use and when?
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to understand the module system is to see how it’s evolved
      over time, and why. So let’s do that first.
    </p>
    <h4 id="javascript-modules-started-in-your-web-browser">
      Javascript modules started in your web browser
    </h4>
    <p>
      Originally JavaScript started in the browser—there was no module system at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because JavaScript was a small language intended to perform only
      small tasks, not build full-blown applications. A module system would have
      been overkill, so JavaScript simply didn’t have one!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as JavaScript apps grew in complexity, developers started to feel the
      absence of an ability to break down applications, especially developers
      using <a
        href="https://stackify.com/exploring-java-9-module-system-and-reactive-streams/"
        >other languages with existing module systems</a
      >. We started to experiment with all kinds of weird hacks with
      <a
        href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript"
        >anonymous functions,</a
      >
      and built big global objects that contained all our code in one huge
      spaghetti mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, <a href="https://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> and
      <a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html">AMD</a> (asynchronous
      module loading) entered the scene. They attempted to unify how modules can
      be achieved in JS. Specifically, they tried to incorporate just-in-time
      module loading, which led to drastic increases in complexity for these
      pseudo-modules.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4 id="javascript-modules-with-node.js">
      Javascript modules with Node.js
    </h4>
    <p>
      When Node.js was invented, modules and code encapsulation were high on the
      priority list. The creators of Node.js were keen for it to not suffer the
      same fate as the browser by having a big, dangerous global scope. So they
      implemented Node.js with a module specification called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS"
        >CommonJS</a
      > (which is where you get the
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html">module exports</a> and
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require">require</a>
      syntax from).
    </p>
    <p>
      To make matters more complicated, though, you can also use the
      soon-to-be-implemented <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import"
        >JavaScript module syntax</a
      >. At the time of writing, this is
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/@giltayar/native-es-modules-in-nodejs-status-and-future-directions-part-i-ee5ea3001f71"
        >still not yet supported in Node.js</a
      >
      but can be implemented with a
      <a
        href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them"
        >transpiler</a
      >, like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, that converts it back to
      CommonJS format. (We’ll save this native syntax for another article.)
    </p>
    <h4 id="so-which-module-system-is-best">So which module system is best?</h4>
    <p>
      We’ve discussed a few existing module syntaxes: AMD, CommonJS, and even
      native JavaScript modules. But which one is best? And why would we need to
      use CommonJS?
    </p>
    <p>The answer is: It depends.</p>
    <p>
      AMD is useful in the browser for performance optimizations. In Node.js,
      CommonJS often makes simplistic sense while JavaScript modules still
      require a pre-compiler. For both, though, native JavaScript modules are a
      good choice. That’s because, even if you’re pre-compiling now, it’s likely
      that sometime in the very near future you’ll be able to whip all your
      pre-compilation steps out.
    </p>
    <p>This doesn’t seem like the greatest of answers, I know.</p>
    <p>
      But there is somewhat of a solution for software authors, and it’s called
      UMD (a Universal Module Definition). UMD allows a JavaScript module to be
      compatible across all the different module formats. If you’re curious how
      UMD works its magic, <a
        href="https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/"
        >check out this article.</a
      >
      You’ll see it’s done with some pretty ugly-looking if-statements but the
      outcome is still the same, universal module usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, by now you’re probably thinking, Why does all this talk of different
      modules matter? And how does it all relate back to module.exports? Let’s
      get to that now!
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-are-module-exports">What are module exports?</h3>
    <p>
      As we said, module.exports are part of the CommonJS specification. But
      what exactly is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Module exports are the instruction that tells Node.js which bits of code
      (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to “export” from a given file so other
      files are allowed to access the exported code. (Don’t worry, we’ll cover
      importing code in the next section.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand modules in Node.js, I like to imagine all my modules written
      together in one file (not as modules), and then imagine what code I’d need
      to make that happen. The code would look like each module wrapped in a
      function and given an argument, which is the current module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoiler alert:
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_wrapper"
        >Modules wrapped in functions is pretty much what happens under the
        hood.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>But why does our module wrapped in a function even matter?</p>
    <p>
      Because the module’s object is simply an argument—an object, in this
      case—to our module that we can manipulate as we please. Below is an
      example of how that module object looks:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{
    id: &#39;.&#39;,
    exports: {},
    parent: null,
    filename: &#39;/test.js&#39;,
    loaded: false,
    children: [],
    paths:
    [
        &#39;/Users/lbichard/Desktop/node_modules&#39;,
        &#39;/Users/lbichard/node_modules&#39;,
        &#39;/Users/node_modules&#39;,
        &#39;/node_modules&#39;
    ]
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, the mystic modules value is just an object passed into our
      module. We can then push to the exports object any values we wish to
      export from our current module.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also see above how exports is a subproperty on our module object.
      Whatever code we now apply to the exports property will become the export
      of our module. When we require our module in another file, it will get the
      value of that exports property.
    </p>
    <pre><code>module.exports.stringProperty = &quot;I love NodeJS&quot;;
console.log(module);
// outputs -&gt;
{
    id: &#39;.&#39;,
    exports: { stringProperty: &#39;I love NodeJS&#39; }
    ...
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note: By default, exports is an object, but it can also be a function,
      number, string, etc.
    </p>
    <h3 id="but-what-about-require">But what about require?</h3>
    <p>To understand modules, we have to understand require, too.</p>
    <p>
      There’s no real sense in exporting functionality if we’re not consuming it
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Require is a function we can use to import other modules, and it looks
      like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>let model = require(&#39;./model.js&#39;);</code></pre>
    <p>Require will search for modules using the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a core module with the required path? Yes, return it.</li>
      <li>
        Is there a node_modules package with the name of the path? Yes, return
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there a file (or directory!) with the name of the given path? Yes,
        return it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, <a href="https://stackify.com/node-js-error-handling/"
          >throw an error.</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As you can see, require is used to pull in different packages by their
      names or file paths.
    </p>
    <p>But what if we require a module multiple times?</p>
    <h3 id="requiring-a-module-multiple-times">
      Requiring a module multiple times
    </h3>
    <p>
      A question I get a lot is this: “If we import the same module in two
      files, will we get the same object reference?” In short, yes. But the
      longer answer is “It depends.” Node.js will cache requests for a given
      module to save time later. But, you can’t rely on this functionality, as
      sometimes the caching system doesn’t work as expected (for reasons we
      won’t go into in this article).
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-to-structure-your-module-exports">
      How to structure your module exports
    </h3>
    <p>
      So now you know that you can apply different bits of code to your module
      exports object. But we never said specifically <em>how</em> you should
      structure your files. It can be a little confusing, as you’ve got a lot of
      flexibility. Do you define your properties as you go? All at the end of
      the file? What’s the standard?
    </p>
    <p>We’ll answer these questions now.</p>
    <h4 id="exporting-as-you-go-vs.-at-the-end-of-a-file">
      Exporting as you go vs. at the end of a file
    </h4>
    <p>
      Knowing we can apply properties to our exports object begs the question:
      When should we do this?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is: It’s totally feasible to apply properties throughout your
      module, as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code>module.exports.getUser = () =&gt; {
    // Code here
}

module.exports.getUsers = () =&gt; {
    // Code here
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you console-logged this as an import, it would return the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{ getUser: [Function], getUsers: [Function] }</code></pre>
    <p>
      An important point to note here is because we used the
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions"
        >fat arrow function,</a
      >
      our functions are anonymous (which can be problematic when trying to
      decipher stack traces).
    </p>
    <p>For this reason, many Node.js developers favor the following pattern:</p>
    <pre><code>function getUser() {
    // Code here
}

function getUsers() {
    // Code here
}

module.exports = {
    getUser,
    getUsers
}</code></pre>
    <p>This would output:</p>
    <pre><code>{ getUser: [Function: getUser], getUsers: [Function: getUsers] }</code></pre>
    <p>
      This gives us function names and documents the API clearly at the end of
      the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      All told, this is a common pattern for JavaScript developers and is called
      the <a

      This post hopefully gave you an introduction to modules and exporting in
      Node.js. I also hope it cleared up some of the mysticism around module
      exports—it’s not really all that magical. Simply keeping your files
      separate and cleanly documenting your code through good structure will
      help you and your team be more productive when writing Node.js code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember: Module.exports is simply an object that you assign properties
      to, and that object gets passed to your requiring file. Be sure to define
      your exports synchronously, and as always… keep it simple!
