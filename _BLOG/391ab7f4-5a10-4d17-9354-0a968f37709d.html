      <em>Server-side rendering</em> (SSR) is a popular technique for rendering
      a client-side <em>single page application</em> (SPA) on the server and
      then sending a fully rendered page to the client. This allows for dynamic
      components to be served as static HTML markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach can be useful for search engine optimization (SEO) when
      indexing does not handle JavaScript properly. It may also be beneficial in
      situations where downloading a large JavaScript bundle is impaired by a
      slow network.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, you will initialize a React app using
      <a
        href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-create-react-app"
        >Create React App</a
      >
      and then modify the project to enable server-side rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> The code provided in this tutorial is for
      educational purposes and is not intended for production use.
      Alternatively, <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> offers a modern
      approach to creating static and server-rendered applications built with
      React.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this tutorial, you will have a working project with a
      client-side React application and a server-side Express application.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>To complete this tutorial, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Node.js installed locally, which you can do by following
        <a
          href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment"
          >How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This tutorial was verified with Node v14.4.0, <code>npm</code> v6.14.5,
      <code>react</code> v16.13.1, <code>@babel/core</code> v7.10.4,
      <code>webpack</code> v4.42.0, <code>express</code> v4.17.1,
      <code>nodemon</code> v2.0.4, and <code>npm-run-all</code> v4.1.5.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-1-creating-the-react-app-and-modifying-the-app-component">
      Step 1 — Creating the React App and Modifying the App Component
    </h2>
    <p>
      First, we use
      <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-npx"
        >npx</a
      >
      to start up a new React app using the latest version of Create React App.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s call our app my-ssr-app:</p>
    <p>Then, we <code>cd</code> into the new directory:</p>
    <pre><code>cd my-ssr-app</code></pre>
    <p>
      Finally, we start our new client-side app in order to verify the
      installation:
    </p>
    <p>You should see an example React app display in your browser window.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s create a <code>&lt;Home&gt;</code> component:</p>
    <p>Next, add the following code to the <code>Home.js</code> file:</p>
    <p>src/Home.js</p>
    <p>
      This will create a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading with a
      <code>"Hello"</code> message directed to a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, let’s render the <code>&lt;Home&gt;</code> in the
      <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> component. Open the <code>App.js</code> file:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, replace the existing lines of code with these new lines of code:
    </p>
    <p>src/App.js</p>
    <p>
      This passes along a <code>name</code> to
      <code>&lt;Home&gt;</code> component so the message that we expect to
      display is <code>"Hello Sammy!"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our app’s <code>index.js</code> file, we’ll use ReactDOM’s
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate"
        ><code>hydrate</code> method</a
      >
      instead of <code>render</code> to indicate to the DOM renderer that we’re
      rehydrating the app after a server-side render.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s open the <code>index.js</code> file:</p>
    <p>
      Then, replace the contents of the <code>index.js</code> file with the
      following code:
    </p>
    <p>index.js</p>
    <p>
      That concludes setting up the client-side, we can move on to setting up
      the server-side.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-2-creating-an-express-server-and-rendering-the-app-component">
      Step 2 — Creating an Express Server and Rendering the App Component
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have our app in place, let’s set up a server that will send
      along a rendered version. We’ll use
      <a
        href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-express-basics"
        >Express for our server</a
      >. Let’s add it to the project by entering the following command in your
      terminal window:
    </p>
    <p>Or, using yarn:</p>
    <p>
      Next, create a <code>server</code> directory next to the app’s
      <code>src</code> directory:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, create a new <code>index.js</code> file that will contain the
      Express server code:
    </p>
    <p>Add the imports that will need and define some constants:</p>
    <p>server/index.js</p>
    <p>Next, add the server code with some error handling:</p>
    <p>server/index.js</p>
    <p>
      As you may see, we can import our <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> component from
      the client app directly from the server.
    </p>
    <p>Three important things are taking place here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We tell Express to serve contents from the <code>build</code> directory
        as static files.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use a method from <code>ReactDOMServer</code>,
        <code>renderToString</code>, to render our app to a static HTML string.
      </li>
      <li>
        We then read the static <code>index.html</code> file from the built
        client app, inject our app’s static content in the
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with an <code>id</code> of <code>"root"</code>,
        and send that as the response to the request.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="step-3-configuring-webpack-babel-and-npm-scripts">
      Step 3 — Configuring webpack, Babel, and <code>npm</code> Scripts
    </h2>
    <p>
      For our server code to work, we’ll need to bundle and transpile it, using
      <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and
      <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>. To accomplish this, let’s add the
      dev dependencies to the project by entering the following command in your
      terminal window:
    </p>
    <p>Or, using yarn:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> An earlier version of this tutorial installed
      <code>babel-core</code>, <code>babel-preset-env</code>, and
      <code>babel-preset-react-app</code>. These packages have since been
      archived, and the mono repo versions are utilized instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, create a Babel configuration file in your project’s root directory:
    </p>
    <p>Then, add the <code>env</code> and <code>react-app</code> presets:</p>
    <p>.babelrc.json</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> An earlier version of this tutorial used a
      <code>.babelrc</code> file (no <code>.json</code> file extension). This
      was a configuration file for Babel 6, but this is no longer the case for
      Babel 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we will create a webpack config for the server that uses Babel Loader
      to transpile the code. Start by creating the
      <code>webpack.server.js</code> file in your project root directory:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, add the following configurations to the
      <code>webpack.server.js</code> file:
    </p>
    <p>webpack.server.js</p>
    <p>
      With this configuration, our transpiled server bundle will be output to
      the <code>server-build</code> folder in a file called
      <code>index.js</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the use of <code>target: 'node'</code> and
      <code>externals: [nodeExternals()]</code> from
      <code>webpack-node-externals</code>, which will omit the files from
      <code>node_modules</code> in the bundle; the server can access these files
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This completes the dependency installation and webpack and Babel
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we will revisit <code>package.json</code> to add helper
      <code>npm</code> scripts:
    </p>
    <p>
      We will add <code>dev:build-server</code>, <code>dev:start</code>, and
      <code>dev</code> scripts to the <code>package.json</code> file to build
      and serve our SSR application easily:
    </p>
    <p>package.json</p>
    <p>
      The <code>dev:build-server</code> script sets the environment to
      <code>"development"</code> and invokes <code>webpack</code> with the
      configuration file we created earlier. The <code>dev:start</code> script
      invokes <code>nodemon</code> to serve the built output.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>dev</code> script invokes <code>npm-run-all</code> to run in
      <code>parallel</code> the <code>build</code> script and all scripts that
      start with <code>dev:*</code> - including
      <code>dev:build-server</code> and <code>dev:start</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You will not need to modify the existing
      <code>"start"</code>, <code>"build"</code>, <code>"test"</code>, and
      <code>"eject"</code> scripts in the <code>package.json</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use <code>nodemon</code> to restart the server when we make changes to
      it. And we use <code>npm-run-all</code> to run multiple commands in
      parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s install those packages now by entering the following commands in
      your terminal window:
    </p>
    <p>Or, using yarn:</p>
    <p>
      With this in place, you can run the following to build the client-side
      app, bundle and transpile the server code, and start up the server on
      <code>:3006</code>:
    </p>
    <p>Or, using yarn:</p>
    <p>
      Our server webpack config will watch for changes and our server will
      restart on changes. For the client app, however, we currently still need
      to build it each time we make changes. There’s an
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1070"
        >open issue for that here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, open <code>http://localhost:3006/</code> in your web browser and you
      will see your server-side rendered app.
    </p>
    <p>Previously, the source code revealed:</p>
    <p>But now, with the changes you made, the source code reveals:</p>
    <p>
      The server-side rendering successfully converted the
      <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> component into HTML.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, you initialized a React application and enabled
      server-side rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this post, we just scratched the surface at what’s possible. Things
      tend to get a bit more complicated once routing, data fetching, or Redux
      also need to be part of a server-side rendered app.
    </p>
    <p>
      One major benefit of using SSR is having an app that can be crawled for
      its content, even for crawlers that don’t execute JavaScript code. This
      can help with search engine optimization (SEO) and providing metadata to
      social media channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      SSR can also often help with performance because a fully loaded app is
      sent down from the server on the first request. For non-trivial apps, your
      mileage may vary because SSR requires a setup that can get a bit
      complicated, and it creates a bigger load on the server. Whether to use
      server-side rendering for your React app depends on your specific needs
      and on which trade-offs make the most sense for your use case.
