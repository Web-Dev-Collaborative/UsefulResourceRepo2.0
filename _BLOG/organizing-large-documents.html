      How do you organize a large collection of information into a cohesive
      document or website? Alternatively, how do you reorganize an existing
      messy document or website into something approachable and useful? The
      following tactics can help:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing to write a single, large document or a set of documents</li>
      <li>Organizing a document</li>
      <li>Adding navigation</li>
      <li>Disclosing information progressively</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="when-to-write-large-documents">When to write large documents</h2>
    <p>
      You can organize a collection of information into longer standalone
      documents or a set of shorter interconnected documents. A set of shorter
      interconnected documents is often published as a website, wiki, or similar
      structured format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some readers respond more positively than others to longer documents.
      Consider the following perspectives from two hypothetical readers you’re
      writing documentation for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hong finds reading long documents difficult and disorientating. He
        prefers to use site search to find answers to his questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rose is comfortable navigating large documents. She often uses the
        built-in page search feature in her web browser to find useful
        information on the current page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, should you organize your material into a single document or into a set
      of documents in a website? Consider the following guidelines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How-to guides, introductory overviews, and conceptual guides often work
        better as shorter documents when aimed at readers who are new to the
        subject matter. For example, a reader who is completely new to your
        subject matter might struggle to remember lots of new terms, concepts,
        and facts. Remember that your audience might be reading your
        documentation to gain a quick and general overview of the topic.
      </li>
      <li>
        In-depth tutorials, best practice guides, and command-line reference
        pages can work well as lengthier documents, especially when aimed at
        readers who already have some experience with the tools and subject
        matter.
      </li>
      <li>
        A great tutorial can rely on a narrative to lead the reader through a
        series of related tasks in a longer document. However, even large
        tutorials can sometimes benefit from being broken up into smaller parts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many longer documents aren’t designed to be read in one sitting. For
        example, users typically scan through a reference page to search for an
        explanation of a command or flag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The remainder of this unit covers techniques that can be useful for
      writing longer documents, such as tutorials and some conceptual guides.
    </p>
    <h2 id="organize-a-document">Organize a document</h2>
    <p>
      This section suggests some techniques for planning a longer document,
      including creating an outline and drafting an introduction. After you’ve
      completed the first draft of a document, you can review it against your
      outline and introduction to make sure you haven’t missed anything you
      originally intended to cover.
    </p>
    <h3 id="outline-a-document">Outline a document</h3>
    <p>
      Starting with a structured, high-level outline can help you group topics
      and determine where more detail is needed. The outline helps you move
      topics around before you get down to writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might find it useful to think of an outline as the narrative for your
      document. There is no standard approach to writing an outline, but the
      following guidelines provide practical tips you might find useful:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before you ask your reader to perform a task, explain to them why they
        are doing it. For example, the following bullet points illustrate a
        section of an outline from a tutorial about auditing and improving the
        accessibility of web pages:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Introduce a browser plugin that audits the accessibility of web
            pages; explain that the reader will use the results of the audit
            report to fix several bugs.
          </li>
          <li>
            List the steps to run the plugin and audit the accessibility of a
            web page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Limit each step of your outline to describing a concept or completing a
        specific task.
      </li>
      <li>
        Structure your outline so that your document introduces information when
        it’s most relevant to your reader. For example, your reader probably
        doesn’t need to know (or want to know) about the history of the project
        in the introductory sections of your document when they’re just getting
        started with the basics. If you feel the history of the project is
        useful, then include a link to this type of information at the end of
        your document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider explaining a concept and then demonstrating how the reader can
        apply it either in a sample project or in their own work. Documents that
        alternate between conceptual information and practical steps can be a
        particularly engaging way to learn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you start drafting, share the outline with your contributors.
        Outlines are especially useful if you’re working with a team of
        contributors who are going to review and test your document.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="outline-exercise">Outline exercise</h3>
    <p>

      long tutorial. To solve this exercise, you can do any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rearrange the existing topics.</li>
      <li>Add any missing topics you feel should be in an introduction.</li>
      <li>Remove any topics you feel are irrelevant for an introduction.</li>

    <h3 id="introduce-a-document">Introduce a document</h3>
    <p>
      If readers of your documentation can’t find relevance in the subject, they
      are likely to ignore it. To set the ground rules for your users, we
      recommend providing an introduction that includes the following
      information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What the document covers.</li>
      <li>What prior knowledge you expect readers to have.</li>
      <li>What the document doesn’t cover.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember that you want to keep your documentation easy to maintain, so
      don’t try to cover everything in the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following paragraph demonstrates the ideas from the preceding list as
      an overview for a hypothetical document publishing platform called
      Froobus:
    </p>
    <p>
      This document explains how to publish Markdown files using the Froobus
      system. Froobus is a publishing system that runs on a Linux server and
      converts Markdown files into HTML pages. This document is intended for
      people who are familiar with Markdown syntax. To learn about the syntax,
      see the Markdown reference. You also need to be comfortable running simple
      commands in a Linux terminal. This document doesn’t include information
      about installing or configuring a Froobus publishing system. For
      information on installing Froobus, see Getting started.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you’ve completed the first draft, check your entire document against
      the expectations you set in your overview. Does your introduction provide
      an accurate overview of the topics you cover? You might find it useful to
      think of this review as a form of documentation quality assurance (QA).
    </p>
    <h3 id="introduction-exercise">Introduction exercise</h3>
    <p>
      For this exercise, review and revise the following introduction for a best
      practices guide for a hypothetical programming language called F@. Remove
      any information you feel is irrelevant in this context and add any
      information you feel is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide lists best practices for working with the F@ programming
      language. F@ was developed in 2011 as an open source community project.
      This guide supplements the F@ style guide. In addition to the best
      practices in this guide, make sure you also install the F@ command-line
      linter and run it on your code. The programming language is widely adopted
      in the health industry. If you have suggestions for additions to the list
      of best practices, file an issue in the F@ documentation repository. ####

    <h2 id="add-navigation">Add navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Providing navigation and signposting for your readers ensures they can
      find what they are looking for and the information they need to get
      unstuck.
    </p>
    <p>Clear navigation includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>introduction and summary sections</li>
      <li>a clear, logical development of the subject</li>
      <li>headings and subheadings that help users understand the subject</li>
      <li>
        a table of contents menu that shows users where they are in the document
      </li>
      <li>links to related resources or more in-depth information</li>
      <li>links to what to learn next</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The tips in the following sections can help you plan the headings in your
      documentation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="prefer-task-based-headings">Prefer task-based headings</h3>
    <p>
      Choose a heading that describes the task your reader is working on. Avoid
      headings that rely on unfamiliar terminology or tools. For example,
      suppose you are documenting the process for creating a new website. To
      create the site, the reader must initialize the Froobus framework. To
      initialize the Froobus framework, the reader must run the
      <code>carambola</code> command-line tool. At first glance, it might seem
      logical to add either of the following headings to the instructions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running the carambola command</li>
      <li>Initializing the Froobus framework</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unless your readers are already very experienced with the terminology and
      concepts for this topic, a more familiar heading might be preferable, such
      as <em>Creating the site</em>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="provide-text-under-each-heading">
      Provide text under each heading
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most readers appreciate at least a brief introduction under each heading
      to provide some context. Avoid placing a level three heading immediately
      after a level two heading, as in the following example:
    </p>
    <p>## Creating the site</p>
    <h3 id="running-the-carambola-command">Running the carambola command</h3>
    <p>In this example, a brief introduction can help orient the reader:</p>
    <p>## Creating the site</p>
    <p>
      To create the site, you run the `carambola` command-line tool. The command
      displays a series of prompts to help you configure the site.
    </p>
    <h3 id="running-the-carambola-command-1">Running the carambola command</h3>
    <h3 id="heading-exercise">Heading exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Helping readers navigate through your documentation helps them find the
      information they need to successfully use your tool. Often, a clear and
      well-organized table of contents or outline acts like a map that helps
      your users navigate the functionality of your tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this exercise, improve the following outline. You can rearrange, add,
      and delete topics and create secondary entries too.

    <p>
      Learning new concepts, ideas, and techniques can be a rewarding experience
      for many readers who are comfortable reading through documentation at
      their own pace. However, being confronted with too many new concepts and
      instructions too quickly can be overwhelming. Readers are more likely to
      be receptive to longer documents that progressively disclose new
      information to them when they need it. The following techniques can help
      you incorporate progressive disclosure in your documents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Where possible, try introducing new terminology and concepts near to the
        instructions that rely on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break up large walls of text. To avoid multiple large paragraphs on a
        single page, aim to introduce tables, diagrams, lists, and headings
        where appropriate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break up large series of steps. If you have a particularly long list of
        complicated steps, try to re-arrange them into shorter lists that
        explain how to complete sub-tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start with simple examples and instructions, and add progressively more
        interesting and complicated techniques. For example, in a tutorial for
        creating forms, start by explaining how to handle text responses, and
        then introduce other techniques to handle multiple choice, images, and
        other response types.
      </li>
    </ul>
