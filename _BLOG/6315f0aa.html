    <p>
      OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain
      limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook,
      GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to
      the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party
      applications to access the user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization
      flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This informational guide is geared towards application developers, and
      provides an overview of OAuth 2 roles, authorization grant types, use
      cases, and flows.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s get started with OAuth Roles!</p>
    <h2 id="oauth-roles">OAuth Roles</h2>
    <p>OAuth defines four roles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resource Owner</li>
      <li>Client</li>
      <li>Resource Server</li>
      <li>Authorization Server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will detail each role in the following subsections.</p>
    <h3 id="resource-owner-user">Resource Owner: <em>User</em></h3>
    <p>
      The resource owner is the <em>user</em> who authorizes an
      <em>application</em> to access their account. The application’s access to
      the user’s account is limited to the “scope” of the authorization granted
      (e.g. read or write access).
    </p>
    <p>
      The resource server hosts the protected user accounts, and the
      authorization server verifies the identity of the <em>user</em> then
      issues access tokens to the <em>application</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an application developer’s point of view, a service’s
      <strong>API</strong> fulfills both the resource and authorization server
      roles. We will refer to both of these roles combined, as the
      <em>Service</em> or <em>API</em> role.
    </p>
    <h3 id="client-application">Client: <em>Application</em></h3>
    <p>
      The client is the <em>application</em> that wants to access the
      <em>user</em>’s account. Before it may do so, it must be authorized by the
      user, and the authorization must be validated by the API.
    </p>
    <h2 id="abstract-protocol-flow">Abstract Protocol Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have an idea of what the OAuth roles are, let’s look at a
      diagram of how they generally interact with each other:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/abstract_flow.png"
        alt="Abstract Protocol Flow"
      />
      <figcaption>Abstract Protocol Flow</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Here is a more detailed explanation of the steps in the diagram:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The <em>application</em> requests authorization to access service
        resources from the <em>user</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the <em>user</em> authorized the request, the
        <em>application</em> receives an authorization grant
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>application</em> requests an access token from the
        <em>authorization server</em> (API) by presenting authentication of its
        own identity, and the authorization grant
      </li>
      <li>
        If the application identity is authenticated and the authorization grant
        is valid, the <em>authorization server</em> (API) issues an access token
        to the application. Authorization is complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>application</em> requests the resource from the
        <em>resource server</em> (API) and presents the access token for
        authentication
      </li>
      <li>
        If the access token is valid, the <em>resource server</em> (API) serves
        the resource to the <em>application</em>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The actual flow of this process will differ depending on the authorization
      grant type in use, but this is the general idea. We will explore different
      grant types in a later section.
    </p>
    <h2 id="application-registration">Application Registration</h2>
    <p>
      Before using OAuth with your application, you must register your
      application with the service. This is done through a registration form in
      the “developer” or “API” portion of the service’s website, where you will
      provide the following information (and probably details about your
      application):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Application Name</li>
      <li>Application Website</li>
      <li>Redirect URI or Callback URL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The redirect URI is where the service will redirect the user after they
      authorize (or deny) your application, and therefore the part of your
      application that will handle authorization codes or access tokens.
    </p>
    <h3 id="client-id-and-client-secret">Client ID and Client Secret</h3>
    <p>
      Once your application is registered, the service will issue “client
      credentials” in the form of a <em>client identifier</em> and a
      <em>client secret</em>. The Client ID is a publicly exposed string that is
      used by the service API to identify the application, and is also used to
      build authorization URLs that are presented to users. The Client Secret is
      used to authenticate the identity of the application to the service API
      when the application requests to access a user’s account, and must be kept
      private between the application and the API.
    </p>
    <h2 id="authorization-grant">Authorization Grant</h2>
    <p>
      In the <em>Abstract Protocol Flow</em> above, the first four steps cover
      obtaining an authorization grant and access token. The authorization grant
      type depends on the method used by the application to request
      authorization, and the grant types supported by the API. OAuth 2 defines
      four grant types, each of which is useful in different cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Authorization Code</strong>: used with server-side Applications
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Implicit</strong>: used with Mobile Apps or Web Applications
        (applications that run on the user’s device)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resource Owner Password Credentials</strong>: used with trusted
        Applications, such as those owned by the service itself
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Client Credentials</strong>: used with Applications API access
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now we will describe grant types in more detail, their use cases and
      flows, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2 id="grant-type-authorization-code">Grant Type: Authorization Code</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>authorization code</strong> grant type is the most commonly
      used because it is optimized for <em>server-side applications</em>, where
      source code is not publicly exposed, and
      <em>Client Secret</em> confidentiality can be maintained. This is a
      redirection-based flow, which means that the application must be capable
      of interacting with the <em>user-agent</em> (i.e. the user’s web browser)
      and receiving API authorization codes that are routed through the
      user-agent.
    </p>
    <p>Now we will describe the authorization code flow:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/auth_code_flow.png"
        alt="Authorization Code Flow"
      />
      <figcaption>Authorization Code Flow</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3 id="step-1-authorization-code-link">Step 1: Authorization Code Link</h3>
    <p>
      First, the user is given an authorization code link that looks like the
      following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL&amp;scope=read</code></pre>
    <p>Here is an explanation of the link components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          ><a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/authorize"
            >https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/authorize</a
          ></strong
        >: the API authorization endpoint
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>client_id=client_id</strong>: the application’s
        <em>client ID</em> (how the API identifies the application)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL</strong>: where the service redirects
        the user-agent after an authorization code is granted
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>response_type=code</strong>: specifies that your application is
        requesting an authorization code grant
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>scope=read</strong>: specifies the level of access that the
        application is requesting
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="step-2-user-authorizes-application">
      Step 2: User Authorizes Application
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the user clicks the link, they must first log in to the service, to
      authenticate their identity (unless they are already logged in). Then they
      will be prompted by the service to <em>authorize</em> or <em>deny</em> the
      application access to their account. Here is an example authorize
      application prompt:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/authcode.png"
        alt="Authorization Code Link"
      />
      <figcaption>Authorization Code Link</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This particular screenshot is of DigitalOcean’s authorization screen, and
      we can see that “Thedropletbook App” is requesting authorization for
      “read” access to the account of “<a href="mailto:manicas@digitalocean.com"
        >manicas@digitalocean.com</a
      >”.
    </p>
    <h3 id="step-3-application-receives-authorization-code">
      Step 3: Application Receives Authorization Code
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the user clicks “Authorize Application”, the service redirects the
      user-agent to the application redirect URI, which was specified during the
      client registration, along with an <em>authorization code</em>. The
      redirect would look something like this (assuming the application is
      “dropletbook.com”):
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://dropletbook.com/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE</code></pre>
    <h3 id="step-4-application-requests-access-token">
      Step 4: Application Requests Access Token
    </h3>
    <p>
      The application requests an access token from the API, by passing the
      authorization code along with authentication details, including the
      <em>client secret</em>, to the API token endpoint. Here is an example POST
      request to DigitalOcean’s token endpoint:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/token?client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&amp;grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&amp;redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL</code></pre>
    <h3 id="step-5-application-receives-access-token">
      Step 5: Application Receives Access Token
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the authorization is valid, the API will send a response containing the
      access token (and optionally, a refresh token) to the application. The
      entire response will look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{&quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,&quot;token_type&quot;:&quot;bearer&quot;,&quot;expires_in&quot;:2592000,&quot;refresh_token&quot;:&quot;REFRESH_TOKEN&quot;,&quot;scope&quot;:&quot;read&quot;,&quot;uid&quot;:100101,&quot;info&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mark E. Mark&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;mark@thefunkybunch.com&quot;}}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now the application is authorized! It may use the token to access the
      user’s account via the service API, limited to the scope of access, until
      the token expires or is revoked. If a refresh token was issued, it may be
      used to request new access tokens if the original token has expired.
    </p>
    <h2 id="grant-type-implicit">Grant Type: Implicit</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>implicit</strong> grant type is used for mobile apps and web
      applications (i.e. applications that run in a web browser), where the
      <em>client secret</em> confidentiality is not guaranteed. The implicit
      grant type is also a redirection-based flow but the access token is given
      to the user-agent to forward to the application, so it may be exposed to
      the user and other applications on the user’s device. Also, this flow does
      not authenticate the identity of the application, and relies on the
      redirect URI (that was registered with the service) to serve this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>The implicit grant type does not support refresh tokens.</p>
    <p>
      The implicit grant flow basically works as follows: the user is asked to
      authorize the application, then the authorization server passes the access
      token back to the user-agent, which passes it to the application. If you
      are curious about the details, read on.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/implicit_flow.png"
        alt="Implicit Flow"
      />
      <figcaption>Implicit Flow</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3 id="step-1-implicit-authorization-link">
      Step 1: Implicit Authorization Link
    </h3>
    <p>
      With the implicit grant type, the user is presented with an authorization
      link, that requests a token from the API. This link looks just like the
      authorization code link, except it is requesting a <em>token</em> instead
      of a code (note the <em>response type</em> “token”):
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL&amp;scope=read</code></pre>
    <h3 id="step-2-user-authorizes-application-1">
      Step 2: User Authorizes Application
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the user clicks the link, they must first log in to the service, to
      authenticate their identity (unless they are already logged in). Then they
      will be prompted by the service to <em>authorize</em> or <em>deny</em> the
      application access to their account. Here is an example authorize
      application prompt:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/authcode.png"
        alt="Authorization Code Link"
      />
      <figcaption>Authorization Code Link</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We can see that “Thedropletbook App” is requesting authorization for
      “read” access to the account of “<a href="mailto:manicas@digitalocean.com"
        >manicas@digitalocean.com</a
      >”.
    </p>
    <h3 id="step-3-user-agent-receives-access-token-with-redirect-uri">
      Step 3: User-agent Receives Access Token with Redirect URI
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the user clicks “Authorize Application”, the service redirects the
      user-agent to the application redirect URI, and includes a URI fragment
      containing the access token. It would look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://dropletbook.com/callback#token=ACCESS_TOKEN</code></pre>
    <h3 id="step-4-user-agent-follows-the-redirect-uri">
      Step 4: User-agent Follows the Redirect URI
    </h3>
    <p>The user-agent follows the redirect URI but retains the access token.</p>
    <p>
      The application returns a webpage that contains a script that can extract
      the access token from the full redirect URI that the user-agent has
      retained.
    </p>
    <h3 id="step-6-access-token-passed-to-application">
      Step 6: Access Token Passed to Application
    </h3>
    <p>
      The user-agent executes the provided script and passes the extracted
      access token to the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the application is authorized! It may use the token to access the
      user’s account via the service API, limited to the scope of access, until
      the token expires or is revoked.
    </p>
    <h2 id="grant-type-resource-owner-password-credentials">
      Grant Type: Resource Owner Password Credentials
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the <strong>resource owner password credentials</strong> grant type,
      the user provides their service credentials (username and password)
      directly to the application, which uses the credentials to obtain an
      access token from the service. This grant type should only be enabled on
      the authorization server if other flows are not viable. Also, it should
      only be used if the application is trusted by the user (e.g. it is owned
      by the service, or the user’s desktop OS).
    </p>
    <h3 id="password-credentials-flow">Password Credentials Flow</h3>
    <p>
      After the user gives their credentials to the application, the application
      will then request an access token from the authorization server. The POST
      request might look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://oauth.example.com/token?grant_type=password&amp;username=USERNAME&amp;password=PASSWORD&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the user credentials check out, the authorization server returns an
      access token to the application. Now the application is authorized!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> DigitalOcean does not currently support the
      password credentials grant type, so the link points to an imaginary
      authorization server at “oauth.example.com”.
    </p>
    <h2 id="grant-type-client-credentials">Grant Type: Client Credentials</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>client credentials</strong> grant type provides an application
      a way to access its own service account. Examples of when this might be
      useful include if an application wants to update its registered
      description or redirect URI, or access other data stored in its service
      account via the API.
    </p>
    <h3 id="client-credentials-flow">Client Credentials Flow</h3>
    <p>
      The application requests an access token by sending its credentials, its
      client ID and client secret, to the authorization server. An example POST
      request might look like the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://oauth.example.com/token?grant_type=client_credentials&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the application credentials check out, the authorization server returns
      an access token to the application. Now the application is authorized to
      use its own account!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> DigitalOcean does not currently support the client
      credentials grant type, so the link points to an imaginary authorization
      server at “oauth.example.com”.
    </p>
    <h2 id="example-access-token-usage">Example Access Token Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Once the application has an access token, it may use the token to access
      the user’s account via the API, limited to the scope of access, until the
      token expires or is revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of an API request, using <code>curl</code>. Note that
      it includes the access token:
    </p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;&quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT&quot; </code></pre>
    <p>
      Assuming the access token is valid, the API will process the request
      according to its API specifications. If the access token is expired or
      otherwise invalid, the API will return an “invalid_request” error.
    </p>
    <h2 id="refresh-token-flow">Refresh Token Flow</h2>
    <p>
      After an access token expires, using it to make a request from the API
      will result in an “Invalid Token Error”. At this point, if a refresh token
      was included when the original access token was issued, it can be used to
      request a fresh access token from the authorization server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example POST request, using a refresh token to obtain a new
      access token:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&amp;refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN</code></pre>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      That concludes this OAuth 2 guide. You should now have a good idea of how
      OAuth 2 works, and when a particular authorization flow should be used.
