      How to Remember More of What You Learn with Spaced Repetition
    </h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Using spaced repetition in conjunction with other study techniques can
        help you memorize information much, much more quickly. Here’s how to do
        it.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ll just say what we’re all thinking: studying takes too much time.</p>
    <p>
      There are only 24 hours in a day, and naturally you’d like to use as many
      of them as possible for sleeping and, I don’t know, drawing pictures of
      robot bears or something. To achieve that goal, you need to find a method
      that lets you spend less time studying while retaining the same amount of
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s the solution: <strong>space out your studying</strong>. By
      introducing time intervals between study sessions, you can remember more –
      even if you spend <em>fewer actual hours</em> studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called <strong>spaced repetition</strong>, and it may be the most
      powerful technique in existence for improving your brain’s ability to
      recall what you study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today we’re going to dig into <em>why</em> it’s so powerful, and I’m going
      to show you how you can use it – both with
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/flash-card-study-tips/"
        >paper flashcards</a
      >
      and with apps. I’ll also show you the time intervals that have been
      scientifically proven to help you
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-improve-memory/"
        >remember the most information</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>But first, let’s look at the history behind this technique.</p>
    <p>
      Spaced repetition leverages a memory phenomenon called the
      <strong>spacing effect</strong>, which describes how our brains learn more
      effectively when we space out our learning over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s how Pierce J. Howard, the author of my least favorite book to haul
      into coffee shops –
      <em
        ><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062227351?tag=colinfgee-20"
          >The Owner’s Manual for the Brain</a
        >
        –</em
      >
      explains it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Work involving higher mental functions, such as analysis and synthesis,
        needs to be spaced out to allow new neural connections to solidify. New
        learning drives out old learning when insufficient time intervenes.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can think of learning as being kind of like building a brick wall; if
      you stack the bricks up too quickly without letting the mortar between
      each layer solidify, you’re not going to end up with a very good wall.
      Spacing our your learning allows that “mental mortar” time to dry.
    </p>
    <p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, <em>any</em> kind of information benefits from this kind of
      spaced practice – which is something that we’ve known since the the birth
      of memory science over a 130 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the late 1880’s, a psychologist named
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus#Contributions_to_memory"
        >Hermann Ebbinghaus</a
      >
      became the first to systematically tackle the analysis of memory, and he
      did this by spending years memorizing lists of nonsensical syllables that
      he made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      By meticulously recording his results – how many times he studied each
      list, the time intervals between his study sessions, and how much he was
      able to remember – Ebbinghaus was able to chart the rate at which memories
      “decay” over time. He showed this rate of decay in a graph called the
      <strong>Forgetting Curve</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Forgetting-Curve.jpg"
        ><img

          alt="Forgetting Curve - Ebbinghaus"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forgetting Curve was incredibly influential to the field of memory
      science, but it’s also a bit misleading. It bolsters the idea that
      memories simply <em>fade away</em> over time. In fact, the truth is a bit
      more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: why do we sometimes remember mundane things – old street
      addresses, random conversations – that we haven’t thought about for <em
        >years?</em
      >
    </p>
    <h2 id="a-new-theory-of-forgetting">
      <a href="#a-new-theory-of-forgetting"></a>A New Theory of Forgetting
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his book <em
        ><a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Surprising-Happens/dp/0812984293?tag=colinfgee-20"
          >How We Learn</a
        >,</em
      >
      author Benedict Carey describes the new theory of disuse (what he calls
      the <strong>“Forget to Learn”</strong> theory), which better explains why
      these memories seem to stick around, even as many others seemingly go the
      way of the dodo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first principle of this theory is that memories have two different
      strengths – <strong>storage strength</strong> and <strong
        >retrieval strength.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage strength</strong> doesn’t fade over time. Once
        information has been acquired and the brain deems it to have met some
        threshold of importance, it stays stored. Storage strength can only
        increase through repeated recall or use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retrieval strength</strong> – the ability to <em>access</em> the
        memory – does fade. It’s fickle, not as voluminous as storage strength,
        and needs regular maintenance.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result, “forgetting” is an <em>accessibility problem.</em> The memory
      exists in storage, but <strong>you can’t find it.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this theory easier to understand, I like to picture my brain as a
      huge library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://collegeinfogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/j-zamora-GWOTvo3qq7U-unsplash-650x432.jpg"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve got plenty of shelf space, and when I add a new book, I can be sure
      that it’ll stay. My library is like the Svalbard Seed Vault of books; no
      thieves are getting in, temperature control is on lock, and the
      ventilation system is patrolled by trained attack praying mantises who
      deal with any sneaky moths.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a library this size, though, the <strong>catalog</strong> needs lots
      of care and maintenance to stay useful. Over time, it’ll get messy and
      less useful unless I
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/file-folder-organization/"
        >keep it organized</a
      >. If I don’t, I won’t be able to find certain books anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no need to be overzealous about it, though. Like any maintenance
      process, there’s a point at which I’ll be “done” and can do no more good
      for now. Then I wait, things decay and become unorganized over time, and I
      come back and tidy them all up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the second principle of the “Forget to Learn” theory: <strong
        >The greater the drop in retrieval strength, the greater the increase in
        learning when the memory is accessed again.</strong
      >
      Here’s how Carey puts it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Some ‘breakdown’ must occur for us to strengthen learning when we
        revisit the material. Without a little forgetting, you get no benefit
        from further study. It is what allows learning to build, like an
        exercised muscle.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Robert Bjork, one of the key contributors to the development of this
      theory, calls this the principle of <em>desirable difficulty.</em> And
      that brings us to the root of why spaced repetition is so powerful: using
      it helps you to <strong>maximize desirable difficulty –</strong> which, in
      turn, maximizes learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turns out, even Hermann Ebbinghaus knew this. During his period of
      research, he found that he could perfectly recite a list of 12 nonsense
      syllables by doing 68 repetitions one day, then 7 the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with only 38 repetitions <em>spaced out over three days,</em> he
      could do just as well. A larger learning period, but a huge reduction in
      the raw amount of time spent actually studying.
    </p>
    <p>As Ebbinghaus put it:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “With any considerable number of repetitions, a suitable distribution of
        them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous than the
        massing of them at a single time.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      <a href="#the-best-spaced-repetition-time-intervals"></a>The Best Spaced
      Repetition Time Intervals
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course, we don’t just want a suitable distribution… we want the <strong
        >best distribution.</strong
      >
      After all, if spacing out your studying helps, there must be some <em
        >optimal</em
      >
      amount of space, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/company/wozniak.htm"
        >Piotr Wozniak</a
      >
      – no relation to the Woz who built Apple’s first computers – spent a ton
      of time researching this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eventually integrated what he found into the first spaced repetition
      computer software, which he called
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. The algorithm that
      determines SuperMemo’s intervals is
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/help/smalg.htm">quite complex</a>, but
      here’s a simplified, nutshell-version of some of his first optimal
      intervals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First repetition: 1 day</li>
      <li>Second repetition: 7 days</li>
      <li>Third repetition: 16 days</li>
      <li>Fourth repetition: 35 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0kp5q19x"
        >A study published in 2008</a
      >
      with over 1,300 subjects also attempted to answer this question, but this
      time with respect to a <em>given test date.</em> What they found is that
      the optimal gap between the first and second study sessions increases in
      relation to how far away the test is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benedict Carey interpreted their data in
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812984293?tag=colinfgee-20"
        ><em>How We Learn</em></a
      > and came up with the following optimal intervals based on different test
      dates:
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you’ve got a test coming up in a week, you should do your first
      session today, and then do the next session either tomorrow or the day
      after. I’d also recommend adding a 3rd session the day before the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to know that these gaps are <em>approximate –</em> as with
      pretty much everything in brain/memory science, it’s hard to make
      completely specific recommendations that will work for everyone. Still,
      these numbers are close, and you should take them into account when you’re
      creating
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/final-exam-study-schedule/"
        >exam study schedules</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as I mentioned a minute ago, Piotr Wozniak implemented (and improved)
      his algorithm in SuperMemo. In fact, there are many spaced repetition apps
      out there that all have complicated algorithms – all of which are being
      regularly tweaked to become better and better.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why tell you about the optimal intervals at all? Well, that’s because
      you can do spaced repetition the old-school way as well – with paper
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/flash-card-study-tips/"

      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways of implementing a spaced repetition system into
      your flashcard studying, but one of the simplest and easiest to use is
      the <strong>Leitner system.</strong> Here’s how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you decide on a number of “boxes” you want to use for your system.
      I have “boxes” in quotes because I don’t own little boxes and am just
      using rubber bands and labeled sticky notes instead – which actually makes
      the whole system more portable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of your boxes represents a different study time interval. In a system
      with five boxes, a good set of intervals would be:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">
          <th>Box No.</th>
          <th>Time Interval</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>Box 1</td>
          <td>Every day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td>Box 2</td>
          <td>Every other day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>Box 3</td>
          <td>Once a week</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td>Box 4</td>
          <td>Once bi-weekly</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>Box 5</td>
          <td>Retired (study before test)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      This schedule roughly follows the original algorithm developed by Piotr
      Wozniak, though I’ve made a couple of changes. First, I’ve stopped
      increasing the interval past two weeks to make the system work for
      realistic test preparation periods. Of course, you can always add more
      boxes if you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, I’ve introduced a “retired” box, which should hold cards that you
      definitely know. If you’re in college, you’re probably already super-busy
      with other things like
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-get-an-internship/"
        >trying to find an internship</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/cheap-textbooks/"
        >coming up with money for textbooks</a
      >, so I think it’s alright to consider those cards “known” – but I still
      think it’s a good idea to review them before a test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every card starts out in Box 1. When you get a card right, it graduates to
      the next box. If you get a card <em>wrong,</em> it goes all the way back
      to Box 1 – <strong>no matter where it was.</strong> In this way, you
      ensure that you’re studying the material that challenges you often.
    </p>
    <p>
      After your boxes are set up, all you need to do is create recurring events
      on your
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/efficient-calendar-use/">calendar</a>
      so you’ll know when to study each box. Pretty simple, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, perhaps the analog lifestyle isn’t for you. Well, come along my
      computer-loving brethren. We can’t upload our consciousnesses and become
      robots <em>yet</em>, but we can at least use…

      The SRS (spaced repetition software) arena has a ton of contenders,
      including the aforementioned
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the most popular one these days is probably
      <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, which I wrote about in my
      <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/self-study/">self-learning article</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anki is popular for good reason; it has a huge community of people who
      share decks (though you’ll learn better by making your own), it’s insanely
      customizable, and there are <strong>free</strong> (with one caveat) apps
      for it on almost every platform, including
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      There’s also a <a href="https://ankiweb.net/about">web client</a>, so you
      can also do your studying straight from the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only caveat is that the iPhone version costs $24.99, which is most
      likely their way of letting people support the program since it’s free
      everywhere else. However, if you can’t afford that (it’s pretty steep for
      an app, I know), you can still use the web version in Mobile Safari.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating cards is easy, and you can add pretty much whatever type of media
      you like to them – which is excellent, since adding pictures can help
      increase retention.

      However, the real killer feature is the ability to
      <strong>rate your answers</strong> based on difficulty when you’re
      studying. After you turn a card over, you can let the program know how
      difficult it was to answer.

      If you got it straight-up wrong, you’ll see it again during the same study
      session until you get it right. If you got it right, but it took a lot of
      work to dredge up the memory, you can tell Anki and it’ll make sure you
      see that card sooner rather than later. By contrast, cards that were a
      snap to remember won’t show up for a while longer.

      This system of rating your answers really helps you get the most out of
      spaced repetition’s two main benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maximizing the <strong>learning improvement</strong> through the spacing
        effect
      </li>
      <li>
        Studying <strong>more efficiently</strong> by not wasting time on cards
        you already know really well
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are tons of alternatives to Anki, though. If you’re looking for even
      more flashcard apps to help with your studies,
