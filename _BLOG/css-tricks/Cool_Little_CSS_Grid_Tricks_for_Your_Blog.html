      I discovered CSS about a decade ago while trying to modify the look of a
      blog I had created. Pretty soon, I was able to code
      <a href="https://codepen.io/thebabydino/details/GRgYQge">cool things</a>
      with more mathematical and, therefore, easier-to-understand features like
      transforms. However, other areas of CSS, such as layout, have remained a
      constant source of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This post is about a problem I encountered about a decade ago and, until
      recently, did not know how to solve in a smart way. Specifically, it’s
      about how I found a solution to a long-running problem using a modern CSS
      grid technique that, in the process, gave me even cooler results than I
      originally imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this is not a tutorial on how to best use CSS grid, but more of
      a walk through my own learning process.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
    <p>
      One of the first things I used to dump on that blog were random photos
      from the city, so I had this idea about having a grid of thumbnails with a
      fixed size. For a nicer look, I wanted this grid to be middle-aligned with
      respect to the paragraphs above and below it, but, at the same time, I
      wanted the thumbnails on the last row to be left-aligned with respect to
      the grid. Meanwhile, the width of the post (and the width of the grid
      within it) would depend on the viewport.
    </p>
    <p>The HTML looks something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;section class=&#39;post__content&#39;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#39;grid--thumbs&#39;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#39;full-size-image.jpg&#39;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#39;thumb-image.jpg&#39; alt=&#39;image description&#39;/&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      It may seem simple, but it turned out to be one of the most difficult CSS
      problems I’ve ever encountered.
    </p>
    <h3 id="less-than-ideal-solutions">Less than ideal solutions</h3>
    <p>
      These are things I have tried or seen suggested over the years, but that
      never really got me anywhere.
    </p>
    <h4 id="floating-impossibility">Floating impossibility</h4>
    <p>
      Floats turned out to be a dead end because I couldn’t figure out how to
      make the grid be middle aligned this way.
    </p>
    <pre><code>.grid--thumbs { overflow: hidden; }

.grid--thumbs a { float: left; }</code></pre>
    <p>
      The demo below shows the float attempt. Resize the embed to see how they
      behave at different viewport widths.
    </p>
    <h4 id="inline-block-madness"><code>inline-block</code> madness</h4>
    <p>At first, this seemed like a better idea:</p>
    <pre><code>.grid--thumbs { text-align: center }

.grid--thumbs a { display: inline-block }</code></pre>
    <p>Except it turned out it wasn’t:</p>
    <p>The last row isn’t left aligned in this case.</p>
    <p>
      At a certain point, thanks to an accidental CSS auto-complete on CodePen,
      I found out about a property called
      <code
        >[text-align-last](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-align-last/)</code
      >, which determines how the last line of a block is aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, setting <code>text-align-last: left</code> on the grid
      wasn’t the solution I was looking for either:
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, I actually considered dropping the idea of a middle aligned
      grid. Could a combo of <code>text-align: justified</code> and
      <code>text-align-last: left</code> on the grid produce a better result?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, turns out it doesn’t. That is, unless there’s only a thumbnail on
      the last row and the gaps between the columns aren’t too big. Resize the
      embed below to see what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is pretty much where I was at two years ago, after nine years of
      trying and failing to come up with a solution to this problem.
    </p>
    <h4 id="messy-flexbox-hacks">Messy flexbox hacks</h4>
    <p>
      A flexbox solution that seemed like it would work at first was to add an
      <code>::after</code> pseudo-element on the grid and set
      <code>flex: 1</code> on both the thumbnails and this pseudo-element:
    </p>
    <pre><code>.grid--thumbs {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;

  a, &amp;::after { flex: 1; }

  img { margin: auto; }

  &amp;:after { content: &#39;AFTER&#39;; }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The demo below shows how this method works. I’ve given the thumbnails and
      the <code>::after</code> pseudo-element purple outlines to make it easier
      to see what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not quite what I wanted because the grid of thumbnails is not
      middle-aligned. Thats said, it doesn’t look too bad… as long as the last
      row has exactly one item less image than the others. As soon as that
      changes, however, the layout breaks if it’s missing more items or none.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/screen_flex_after_issue.png?ssl=1"
        alt="Screenshot collage. Shows how the layout breaks when the last row is not missing exactly one item to be full."
      />

        Screenshot collage. Shows how the layout breaks when the last row is not
        missing exactly one item to be full.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Why the <code>::after</code> hack is not reliable.</p>
    <p>
      That was one hacky idea. Another is not to use a pseudo-element, but add
      as many empty divs after the thumbnails as there are columns that we’re
      expecting to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expected number of columns is something we should be able to
      approximate since the size of the thumbnails is fixed and we probably want
      to set a maximum width for the post since text that stretches across the
      width of a full screen can visually exhausting for eyes to read. Dividing
      the maximum width by the fixed thumbnail width should give us the maximum
      number of columns in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first empty elements will take up the full width of the row that’s not
      completely filled with thumbnails, while the rest will spill into other
      rows. But since their <code>height</code> is zero, it won’t matter
      visually.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of does the trick but, again, it’s hacky and still doesn’t
      produce the exact result I want since it sometimes ends up with big and
      kind of ugly-looking gaps between the columns.
    </p>
    <h4 id="a-grid-solution">A grid solution?</h4>
    <p>
      The grid layout has always sounded like the answer, given its name. The
      problem was that all examples I had seen by then were using a predefined
      number of columns and that doesn’t work for this particular pattern where
      the number of columns is determined by the viewport width.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, while coding a collection of one element, pure CSS background
      patterns, I had the idea of generating a bunch of media queries that would
      modify a CSS variable, <code>--n</code>, corresponding to the number of
      columns used to set <code>grid-template-columns</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$w: 13em;
$h: 19em;
$f: $h/$w;
$n: 7;
$g: 1em;

--h: #{$f*$w};
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--n, #{$n}), var(--w, #{$w}));
grid-gap: $g;
place-content: center;

@for $i from 1 to $n {
  @media (max-width: ($n - $i + 1)*$w + ($n - $i + 2)*$g) {
    --n: #{$n - $i}
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      I was actually super proud of this idea at the time, even though I cringe
      looking back on it now. One media query for every number of columns
      possible is not exactly ideal, not to mention it doesn’t work so well when
      the grid width doesn’t equal the viewport width, but is still somewhat
      flexible and also depends on the width of its siblings.
    </p>
    <h3 id="a-magic-solution">A magic solution</h3>
    <p>
      I finally came across a better solution while working with CSS grid and
      failing to understand why the <code>repeat()</code> function wasn’t
      working in a particular situation. It was so frustrating and prompted me
      to go to MDN, where I happened to notice the
      <code
        >[auto-fit](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/)</code
      >
      keyword and, while I didn’t understand the explanation, I had a hunch that
      it could help with <em>this</em> other problem, so I dropped everything
      else I was doing and gave it a try.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s what I got:</p>
    <pre><code>.grid--thumbs {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
  grid-gap: .25em;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 8em);
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      I also discovered the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax"
        ><code>minmax()</code></a
      >
      function, which can be used in place of fixed sizes on grid items. I still
      haven’t been able to understand exactly how <code>minmax()</code> works —
      and the more I play with it, the less I understand it — but what it looks
      like it does in this situation is create the grid then stretch its columns
      equally until they fill all of the available space:
    </p>
    <pre><code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(8em, 1fr));</code></pre>
    <p>
      Another cool thing we can do here is prevent the image from overflowing
      when it’s wider than the grid element. We can do this by replacing the
      minimum <code>8em</code> with <code>min(8em, 100%)</code> That essentially
      ensures that images will never exceed 100%, but never below 8em. Thanks to
      Chris for this suggestion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min"
        ><code>min()</code></a
      >
      function doesn’t work in pre-Chromium Edge!
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that this only produces a nice result if all of the images
      have the same aspect ratio — like the square images I’ve used here. For my
      blog, this was not an issue since all photos were taken with my Sony
      Ericsson W800i phone, and they all had the same aspect ratio. But if we
      were to drop images with different aspect ratios, the grid wouldn’t look
      as good anymore:
    </p>
    <p>
      We can, of course, set the image <code>height</code> to a fixed value, but
      that distorts the images… unless we set
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-object-fit-and-object-position/"
        ><code>object-fit</code></a
      >
      to <code>cover</code>, which solves our problem!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea would be to turn the first thumbnail into a sort of banner
      that spans all grid columns. The one problem is that we don’t know the
      number of columns because that depends on the viewport. But, there
      <em>is</em> a solution — we can set <code>grid-column-end</code> to
      <code>-1</code>!
    </p>
    <pre><code>.grid--thumbs {


  a:first-child {
    grid-column: 1/ -1;

    img { height: 13em }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The first image gets a bigger <code>height</code> than all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if we wanted the image to span all columns except the last, one
      we’d set it to <code>-2</code> and so on… negative column indices are a
      thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>auto-fill</code> is another grid property keyword I noticed on MDN.
      The explanations for both are long walls of text without visuals, so I
      didn’t find them particularly useful. Even worse, replacing
      <code>auto-fit</code> with <code>auto-fill</code> in any of the grid demos
      above produces absolutely no difference. How they really work and how they
      differ still remains a mystery, even after checking out
      <a
        href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/#article-header-id-0"
        >articles</a
      >
      or toying with
      <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example37/">examples</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, trying out different things and seeing what happens in various
      scenarios at one point led me to the conclusion that, if we’re using a
      <code>minmax()</code> column width and not a fixed one (like
      <code>8em</code>), then it’s probably better to use
      <code>auto-fill</code> instead of <code>auto-fit</code> because, the
      result looks better if we happen to only have a few images, as illustrated
      by the interactive demo below:
    </p>
    <p>
      I think what I personally like best is the initial idea of a thumbnail
      grid that’s middle-aligned and has a mostly fixed column width (but still
      uses <code>min(100%, 15em)</code> instead of just
      <code>15em</code> though). At the end of the day, it’s a matter of
      personal preference and what can be seen in the demo below just happens to
      look better to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m using <code>auto-fit</code> in this demo because it produces the same
      result as <code>auto-fill</code> and is one character shorter. However,
      what I didn’t understand when making this is that both keywords produce
      the same result because there are more items in the gallery than we need
      to fill a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once that changes, <code>auto-fit</code> and
      <code>auto-fill</code> produce different results, as illustrated below.
      You can change the <code>justify-content</code> value and the number of
      items placed on the grid:
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not really sure which is the better choice. I guess this also depends
      on personal preference. Coupled with <code>justify-content: center</code>,
      <code>auto-fill</code> seems to be the more logical option, but, at the
      same time, <code>auto-fit</code> produces a better-looking result.
