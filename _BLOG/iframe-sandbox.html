    <p>
      Constructing a rich experience on today’s web almost unavoidably involves
      embedding components and content over which you have no real control.
      Third-party widgets can drive engagement and play a critical role in the
      overall user experience, and user-generated content is sometimes even more
      important than a site’s native content. Abstaining from either isn’t
      really an option, but both increase the risk that Something Bad™ could
      happen on your site. Each widget that you embed – every ad, every social
      media widget – is a potential attack vector for those with malicious
      intent:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/"
        >Content Security Policy (CSP)</a
      >
      can mitigate the risks associated with both of these types of content by
      giving you the ability to whitelist specifically trusted sources of script
      and other content. This is a major step in the right direction, but it’s
      worth noting that the protection that most CSP directives offer is binary:
      the resource is allowed, or it isn’t. There are times when it would be
      useful to say “I’m not sure I actually <em>trust</em> this source of
      content, but it’s soooo pretty! Embed it please, Browser, but don’t let it
      break my site.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="least-privilege">Least Privilege</h2>
    <p>
      In essence, we’re looking for a mechanism that will allow us to grant
      content we embed only the minimum level of capability necessary to do its
      job. If a widget doesn’t <em>need</em> to pop up a new window, taking away
      access to window.open can’t hurt. If it doesn’t require Flash, turning off
      plugin support shouldn’t be a problem. We’re as secure as we can be if we
      follow the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege"
        >principle of least privilege</a
      >, and block each and every feature that isn’t directly relevant to
      functionality we’d like to use. The result is that we no longer have to
      blindly trust that some piece of embedded content won’t take advantage of
      privileges it shouldn’t be using. It simply won’t have access to the
      functionality in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>iframe</code> elements are the first step toward a good framework
      for such a solution. Loading some untrusted component in an
      <code>iframe</code> provides a measure of separation between your
      application and the content you’d like to load. The framed content won’t
      have access to your page’s DOM, or data you’ve stored locally, nor will it
      be able to draw to arbitrary positions on the page; it’s limited in scope
      to the frame’s outline. The separation isn’t truly robust, however. The
      contained page still has a number of options for annoying or malicious
      behavior: autoplaying video, plugins, and popups are the tip of the
      iceberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-sandbox"
        ><strong><code>sandbox</code></strong> attribute of the
        <code>iframe</code> element</a
      >
      gives us just what we need to tighten the restrictions on framed content.
      We can instruct the browser to load a specific frame’s content in a
      low-privilege environment, allowing only the subset of capabilities
      necessary to do whatever work needs doing.

    <p>
      Twitter’s “Tweet” button is a great example of functionality that can be
      more safely embedded on your site via a sandbox. Twitter allows you to
      <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button#using-an-iframe"
        >embed the button via an iframe</a
      >
      with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html&quot;
        style=&quot;border: 0; width:130px; height:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      To figure out what we can lock down, let’s carefully examine what
      capabilities the button requires. The HTML that’s loaded into the frame
      executes a bit of JavaScript from Twitter’s servers, and generates a popup
      populated with a tweeting interface when clicked. That interface needs
      access to Twitter’s cookies in order to tie the tweet to the correct
      account, and needs the ability to submit the tweeting form. That’s pretty
      much it; the frame doesn’t need to load any plugins, it doesn’t need to
      navigate the top-level window, or any of a number of other bits of
      functionality. Since it doesn’t need those privileges, let’s remove them
      by sandboxing the frame’s content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandboxing works on the basis of a whitelist. We begin by removing all
      permissions possible, and then turn individual capabilities back on by
      adding specific flags to the sandbox’s configuration. For the Twitter
      widget, we’ve decided to enable JavaScript, popups, form submission, and
      twitter.com’s cookies. We can do so by adding a
      <code>sandbox</code> attribute to the <code>iframe</code> with the
      following value:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;iframe sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms&quot;
    src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html&quot;
    style=&quot;border: 0; width:130px; height:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      That’s it. We’ve given the frame all the capabilities it requires, and the
      browser will helpfully deny it access to any of the privileges that we
      didn’t explicitly grant it via the <code>sandbox</code> attribute’s value.
    </p>
    <h3 id="granular-control-over-capabilities">
      Granular Control over Capabilities
    </h3>
    <p>
      We saw a few of the possible sandboxing flags in the example above, let’s
      now dig through the inner workings of the attribute in a little more
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given an iframe with an empty sandbox attribute (<code
        >&lt;iframe sandbox src="..."&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;</code
      >), the framed document will be fully sandboxed, subjecting it to the
      following restrictions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript will not execute in the framed document. This not only
        includes JavaScript explicitly loaded via script tags, but also inline
        event handlers and javascript: URLs. This also means that content
        contained in noscript tags will be displayed, exactly as though the user
        had disabled script herself.
      </li>
      <li>
        The framed document is loaded into a unique origin, which means that all
        same-origin checks will fail; unique origins match no other origins
        ever, not even themselves. Among other impacts, this means that the
        document has no access to data stored in any origin’s cookies or any
        other storage mechanisms (DOM storage, Indexed DB, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        The framed document cannot create new windows or dialogs (via
        <code>window.open</code> or <code>target="_blank"</code>, for instance).
      </li>
      <li>Forms cannot be submitted.</li>
      <li>Plugins will not load.</li>
      <li>
        The framed document can only navigate itself, not its top-level parent.
        Setting <code>window.top.location</code> will throw an exception, and
        clicking on link with <code>target="_top"</code> will have no effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Features that trigger automatically (autofocused form elements,
        autoplaying videos, etc.) are blocked.
      </li>
      <li>Pointer lock cannot be obtained.</li>
      <li>
        The <code>seamless</code> attribute is ignored on
        <code>iframes</code> the framed document contains.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is nicely draconian, and a document loaded into a fully sandboxed
      <code>iframe</code> poses very little risk indeed. Of course, it also
      can’t do much of value: you might be able to get away with a full sandbox
      for some static content, but most of the time you’ll want to loosen things
      up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of plugins, each of these restrictions can be lifted by
      adding a flag to the sandbox attribute’s value. Sandboxed documents can
      never run plugins, as plugins are unsandboxed native code, but everything
      else is fair game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-forms</code></strong> allows form submission.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-popups</code></strong> allows popups
        (<code>window.open()</code>, <code>showModalDialog()</code>,
        <code>target=”_blank”</code>, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-pointer-lock</code></strong> allows (surprise!)
        pointer lock.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-same-origin</code></strong> allows the document to
        maintain its origin; pages loaded from
        <code>https://example.com/</code> will retain access to that origin’s
        data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-scripts</code></strong> allows JavaScript execution,
        and also allows features to trigger automatically (as they’d be trivial
        to implement via JavaScript).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-top-navigation</code></strong> allows the document
        to break out of the frame by navigating the top-level window.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With these in mind, we can evaluate exactly why we ended up with the
      specific set of sandboxing flags in the Twitter example above:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-scripts</code></strong> is required, as the page
        loaded into the frame runs some JavaScript to deal with user
        interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-popups</code></strong> is required, as the button
        pops up a tweeting form in a new window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-forms</code></strong> is required, as the tweeting
        form should be submittable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>allow-same-origin</code></strong> is necessary, as
        twitter.com’s cookies would otherwise be inaccessible, and the user
        couldn’t log in to post the form.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One important thing to note is that the sandboxing flags applied to a
      frame also apply to any windows or frames created in the sandbox. This
      means that we have to add <strong><code>allow-forms</code></strong> to the
      frame’s sandbox, even though the form only exists in the window that the
      frame pops up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the <code>sandbox</code> attribute in place, the widget gets only the
      permissions it requires, and capabilities like plugins, top navigation,
      and pointer lock remain blocked. We’ve reduced the risk of embedding the
      widget, with no ill-effects. It’s a win for everyone concerned.
    </p>
    <h2 id="privilege-separation">Privilege Separation</h2>
    <p>
      Sandboxing third-party content in order to run their untrusted code in a
      low-privilege environment is fairly obviously beneficial. But what about
      your own code? You trust yourself, right? So why worry about sandboxing?
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d turn that question around: if your code doesn’t need plugins, why give
      it access to plugins? At best, it’s a privilege you never use, at worst
      it’s a potential vector for attackers to get a foot in the door.
      Everyone’s code has bugs, and practically every application is vulnerable
      to exploitation in one way or another. Sandboxing your own code means that
      even if an attacker successfully subverts your application, they won’t be
      given <em>full</em> access to the application’s origin; they’ll only be
      able to do things the application could do. Still bad, but not as bad as
      it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reduce the risk even further by breaking your application up into
      logical pieces and sandboxing each piece with the minimal privilege
      possible. This technique is very common in native code: Chrome, for
      example, breaks itself into a high-privilege browser process that has
      access to the local hard-drive and can make network connections, and many
      low-privilege renderer processes that do the heavy lifting of parsing
      untrusted content. Renderers don’t need to touch the disk, the browser
      takes care of giving them all the information they need to render a page.
      Even if a clever hacker finds a way to corrupt a renderer, she hasn’t
      gotten very far, as the renderer can’t do much of interest on its own: all
      high-privilege access must be routed through the browser’s process.
      Attackers will need to find several holes in different pieces of the
      system order to do any damage, which hugely reduces the risk of successful
      pwnage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="safely-sandboxing-eval">Safely sandboxing <code>eval()</code></h3>
    <p>
      With sandboxing and the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.postMessage"
        ><code>postMessage</code> API</a
      >, the success of this model is fairly straightforward to apply to the
      web. Pieces of your application can live in sandboxed
      <code>iframe</code>s, and the parent document can broker communication
      between them by posting messages and listening for responses. This sort of
      structure ensures that exploits in any one piece of the app do the minimum
      damage possible. It also has the advantage of forcing you to create clear
      integration points, so you know exactly where you need to be careful about
      validating input and output. Let’s walk through a toy example, just to see
      how that might work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/static/demos/evalbox/index.html"
        >Evalbox</a
      >
      is an exciting application that takes a string, and evaluates it as
      JavaScript. Wow, right? Just what you’ve been waiting for all these long
      years. It’s a fairly dangerous application, of course, as allowing
      arbitrary JavaScript to execute means that any and all data an origin has
      to offer is up for grabs. We’ll mitigate the risk of Bad Things™ happening
      by ensuring that the code is executed inside of a sandbox, which makes it
      quite a bit safer. We’ll work our way through the code from the inside
      out, starting with the frame’s contents:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;!-- frame.html --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Evalbox&#39;s Frame&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     window.addEventListener(&#39;message&#39;, function (e) {
       var mainWindow = e.source;
       var result = &#39;&#39;;
       try {
         result = eval(e.data);
       } catch (e) {
         result = &#39;eval() threw an exception.&#39;;
       }
       mainWindow.postMessage(result, event.origin);
     });
   &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Inside the frame, we have a minimal document that simply listens for
      messages from its parent by hooking into the <code>message</code> event of
      the <code>window</code> object. Whenever the parent executes postMessage
      on the iframe’s contents, this event will trigger, giving us access to the
      string our parent would like us to execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the handler, we grab the <code>source</code> attribute of the event,
      which is the parent window. We’ll use this to send the result of our hard
      work back up once we’re done. Then we’ll do the heavy lifting, by passing
      the data we’ve been given into <code>eval()</code>. This call has been
      wrapped up in a try block, as banned operations inside a sandboxed
      <code>iframe</code> will frequently generate DOM exceptions; we’ll catch
      those and report a friendly error message instead. Finally, we post the
      result back to the parent window. This is pretty straightforward stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parent is similarly uncomplicated. We’ll create a tiny UI with a
      <code>textarea</code> for code, and a <code>button</code> for execution,
      and we’ll pull in <code>frame.html</code> via a sandboxed
      <code>iframe</code>, allowing only script execution:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;textarea id=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;button id=&#39;safe&#39;&gt;eval() in a sandboxed frame.&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;iframe sandbox=&#39;allow-scripts&#39;
        id=&#39;sandboxed&#39;
        src=&#39;frame.html&#39;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now we’ll wire things up for execution. First, we’ll listen for responses
      from the <code>iframe</code> and <code>alert()</code> them to our users.
      Presumably a real application would do something less annoying:
    </p>
    <pre><code>window.addEventListener(&#39;message&#39;,
    function (e) {
      // Sandboxed iframes which lack the &#39;allow-same-origin&#39;
      // header have &quot;null&quot; rather than a valid origin. This means you still
      // have to be careful about accepting data via the messaging API you
      // create. Check that source, and validate those inputs!
      var frame = document.getElementById(&#39;sandboxed&#39;);
      if (e.origin === &quot;null&quot; &amp;&amp; e.source === frame.contentWindow)
        alert(&#39;Result: &#39; + e.data);
    });</code></pre>
    <p>
      Next, we’ll hook up an event handler to clicks on the <code>button</code>.
      When the user clicks, we’ll grab the current contents of the
      <code>textarea</code>, and pass them into the frame for execution:
    </p>
    <pre><code>function evaluate() {
  var frame = document.getElementById(&#39;sandboxed&#39;);
  var code = document.getElementById(&#39;code&#39;).value;
  // Note that we&#39;re sending the message to &quot;*&quot;, rather than some specific
  // origin. Sandboxed iframes which lack the &#39;allow-same-origin&#39; header
  // don&#39;t have an origin which you can target: you&#39;ll have to send to any
  // origin, which might alow some esoteric attacks. Validate your output!
  frame.contentWindow.postMessage(code, &#39;*&#39;);
}

document.getElementById(&#39;safe&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, evaluate);</code></pre>
    <p>
      Easy, right? We’ve created a very simple evaluation API, and we can be
      sure that code that’s evaluated doesn’t have access to sensitive
      information like cookies or DOM storage. Likewise, evaluated code can’t
      load plugins, pop up new windows, or any of a number of other annoying or
      malicious activities.
    </p>
    <p>Take a look at the code for yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/static/demos/evalbox/index.html"
          >Evalbox Demo</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/static/demos/evalbox/index.html"
          ><code>index.html</code></a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/static/demos/evalbox/frame.html"
          ><code>frame.html</code></a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can do the same for your own code by breaking monolithic applications
      into single-purpose components. Each can be wrapped in a simple messaging
      API, just like what we’ve written above. The high-privilege parent window
      can act as a controller and dispatcher, sending messages into specific
      modules that each have the fewest privileges possible to do their jobs,
      listening for results, and ensuring that each module is well-fed with only
      the information it requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note, however, that you need to be very careful when dealing with framed
      content that comes from the same origin as the parent. If a page on
      <code>https://example.com/</code> frames another page on the same origin
      with a sandbox that includes both the
      <strong><code>allow-same-origin</code></strong> and
      <strong><code>allow-scripts</code></strong> flags, then the framed page
      can reach up into the parent, and remove the sandbox attribute entirely.

        href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=iframe-sandbox"
        >caniuse, of course, has an up-to-date support table</a
      >). Applying the <code>sandbox</code> attribute to
      <code>iframes</code> you include allows you to grant certain privileges to
      the content they display, <em>only</em> those privileges which are
      necessary for the content to function correctly. This gives you the
      opportunity to reduce the risk associated with the inclusion of
      third-party content, above and beyond what is already possible with
      <a
        href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/"
        >Content Security Policy</a
      >.
    </p>

      Moreover, sandboxing is a powerful technique for reducing the risk that a
      clever attacker will be able to exploit holes in your own code. By
      separating a monolithic application into a set of sandboxed services, each
      responsible for a small chunk of self-contained functionality, attackers
      will be forced to not only compromise specific frames’ content, but also
      their controller. That’s a much more difficult task, especially since the
      controller can be greatly reduced in scope. You can spend your
      security-related effort auditing <em>that</em> code if you ask the browser
      for help with the rest.

      That’s not to say that sandboxing is a complete solution to the problem of
      security on the internet. It offers defense in depth, and unless you have
      control over your users’ clients, you can’t yet rely on browser support
      for all your users (if you do control your users clients – an enterprise
      environment, for example – hooray!). Someday… but for now sandboxing is
      another layer of protection to strengthen your defenses, it’s not a
      complete defense upon which you can soley rely. Still, layers are
      excellent. I suggest making use of this one.

          Sandboxing can be even more flexible when combined with two other new
          iframe attributes:
          <a
            href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-srcdoc"
            ><code>srcdoc</code></a
          >, and
          <a
            href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-seamless"
            ><code>seamless</code></a
          >. The former allows you to populate a frame with content without the
          overhead of an HTTP request, and the latter allows style to flow into
          the framed content. Both have fairly miserable browser support at the
          moment (Chrome and WebKit nightlies). but will be an interesting
          combination in the future. You could, for example, sandbox comments on
          an article via the following code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;iframe sandbox seamless
        srcdoc=&quot;&lt;p&gt;This is a user&#39;s comment!
                   It can&#39;t execute script!
                   Hooray for safety!&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
