<p>Many tech companies will ask you to code something.</p>
<p>If the position you’re applying to involves writing code and the interviewer(s) do not ask you to code something <em>or</em> do not look at any of your previous work, consider that a big red flag.</p>
<p>Most companies will ask you to code something in real-time while observing you. Some may have you tackle the problem individually, while others may have you pair program with someone on the team. Some interviews are in-person, some are over the phone. For phone interviews, you may share an editor with the interviewer.</p>
<p>Some companies will give you a “take home” coding problem. You’ll have a limited amount of time to solve the problem(s), typically a few days. In these situations you can use any non-restricted resource to solve the problem (e.g. access to the internet and books are allowed). These problems tend to be slightly more difficult than the problems in “real-time” interviews, but I prefer this style because it’s more realistic to how you work.</p>
<p>No matter the type of coding interview, they typically want to see</p>
<ul>
<li>clean code</li>
<li>robust code</li>
<li>use of patterns where justified</li>
<li>tests</li>
<li>your thought process</li>
<li>communication skills</li>
</ul>
<p>In coding interviews, you usually don’t need the best solution. They want to see how you approach the problem. It’s crucial that you <strong>communicate</strong> while working on the problem.</p>
<p>Questions are often intentionally underspecified. Ask questions to clarify before writing a solution. Never start writing code before asking questions.</p>
<p>Little details like syntax errors don’t matter. Can’t figure out if it’s <code>size()</code> or <code>length()</code>? Say you’re unsure, choose one, describe what it does, and move on.</p>
<p>For whiteboard coding, don’t get bogged down by details. Write high-level code first that uses lots of undefined methods, and define them later if needed.</p>
<p>Test your code. If short on time, do it manually or with well-placed assertions. If you have more time, go for unit tests. Show that you think about testing.</p>
<p>Interviewers expect code in a programming language. You can start with pseudocode as long as you tell your interviewer that you’ll write real code later.</p>
<p>Use a language that you would use on the job. If the job posting didn’t specify a language, try to use a popular language that the interviewer is likely to be familiar with. Python is usually a safe choice. Other common options are Ruby, Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Avoid doing complicated stuff. Don’t try impress your interviewer with complex solutions, often the most readable and simplest solution is best in the interview.</p>
<p>Start with the most obvious solution (often brute force) and then iterate and improve it.</p>
<p>After you’ve written the code, the interview will likely review it with you and ask why you did something a certain way and if it can be improved.</p>
<p>Interviewers aren’t given a list of questions to use. They choose their own. Chances are they know the problem well and various ways how to solve it. So if you tell them that they are wrong about a solution, you better be sure.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck, say you’re stuck. Think out loud. Nothing is worse than being quiet, especially during a phone interview.</p>
