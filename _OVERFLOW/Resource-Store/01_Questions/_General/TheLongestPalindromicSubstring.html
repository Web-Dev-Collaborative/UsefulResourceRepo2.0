<p>Palindrome questions are very common in the interview, this article provides some insights about palindromic problem.</p>
<p>To specific : &gt; A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome">reference</a></p>
<p>For example: <code>aba</code> and <code>abba</code> are both palindromic, because they are symetric strings, that you can read each of them in reversed order, and you can just get a same string.</p>
<p>Notice: palindrome string could be in either odd length or even length, a good solution would be <strong>double pointers</strong>. Next, I’ll show you how <strong>doulbe pointers</strong> work in a real leetcode problem.</p>

<pre><code>string longestPalindrome(string s) {}</code></pre>
<h3 id="thinking">1. Thinking</h3>
<p>Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.</p>
<p>A very interesting pespective: 1. Reversing s in to s’ 2. Finding the longest common substring.</p>
<p>For instance, a string <code>abacd</code>, a reversed version is <code>dcaba</code>, and the longest common string is <code>aba</code>, seemingly perfect.</p>
<p>However, it would be wrong when we apply to <code>aacxycaa</code>, which a reversed version would be <code>aacyxcaa</code>, then the longest common substring turns out to be <code>aac</code>. But, what we need should be <code>aa</code>.</p>
<p>Although this way has its faults, <strong>we can still get some inspirations that we can transform a problem seemingly hard into another simpler problem that we can understand easier.</strong></p>
<p>Now, <strong>the double pointers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Core idea: start a scanner from the mid point of the string</strong> we represent the idea into pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>for 0 &lt;= i &lt; len(s):
    find a palindrome that set s[i] as its mid point
    update the answer</code></pre>
<p>When the length of string is even, for instance: <code>abba</code>, the code above would not work.</p>
<p>So, a better version here :</p>
<pre><code>for 0 &lt;= i &lt; len(s):
    find a palindrome that set s[i] as its mid point
    find a palindrome that set s[i] and s[i + 1] as its mid point
    update the answer</code></pre>
<p>PS: you may encounter some problems like : outofIndex error. Don’t worry, we’ll fix them later.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">2. Implementation</h3>
<p>a function implementation:</p>
<pre><code>string palindrome(string&amp; s, int l, int r) {
    // avoid outOfIndex error
    while (l &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; r &lt; s.size()
            &amp;&amp; s[l] == s[r]) {
        // scanning toward both directions
        l--; r++;
    }
    // return a palindrome that set s[l] and s[r] as mid point
    return s.substr(l + 1, r - l - 1);
}</code></pre>
<p>Why we need both pointer <code>l</code> and pointer <code>r</code>? <strong>In this way, we can handle palindrome strings in odd and even length</strong></p>
<pre><code>for 0 &lt;= i &lt; len(s):
    # find a palindrome that set s[i] as its mid 
    palindrome(s, i, i)
    # find a palindrome that set s[i] and s[i + 1] as its mid  
    palindrome(s, i, i + 1)
    update the answer</code></pre>
<p>Completed code solution:</p>
<pre><code>string longestPalindrome(string s) {
    string res;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.size(); i++) {
        // find a palindrome that set s[i] as its mid 
        string s1 = palindrome(s, i, i);
        // find a palindrome that set s[i] and s[i + 1] as its mid  
        string s2 = palindrome(s, i, i + 1);
        // res = longest(res, s1, s2)
        res = res.size() &gt; s1.size() ? res : s1;
        res = res.size() &gt; s2.size() ? res : s2;
    }
    return res;
}</code></pre>
<p>Thus, this leetcode problem is solved. Now, we get:</p>
<p>Time complexity: O(N^2)</p>
<p>Space complexity: O(1)</p>
<p>By the way, a dynamic programming approach can also work in this problem in a same time complexity. However, we need at least O(N^2) spaces to store DP table. Therefore, in this problem, dp approach is not the best solution.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>Manacher’s Algorithm</strong> requires only O(N) time complexity. You readers can search it through the Internet by your own interests. It should be very interesting.</p>
