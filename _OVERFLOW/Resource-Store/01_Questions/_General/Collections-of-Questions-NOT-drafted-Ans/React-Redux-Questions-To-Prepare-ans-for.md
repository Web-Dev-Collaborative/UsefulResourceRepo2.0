### Interview questions on React-Redux that I am yet to make a good note / ans of

1&gt; How to optimize React component to render it less often? (using shouldComponentUpdate to determine if any relevant data changed)

2&gt; What are best practices? (for example why not to use getInitialState, try to find others and know how to explain them)

3&gt; React is rarely used by itself, so expect some questions about data layer, most commonly an implementation of flux:

4&gt; What is flux? How it’s different from the more traditional MVC pattern?

5&gt; How does Redux data flow work? (view, action creator, reducer, view — you should know and explain responsibilities of each; also how state is represented — state tree)

6&gt; Comparison with Angular Js and VUE js?

7&gt; Understanding on state, props, event handling, data sharing, ajax in react, polling, routing

8&gt; Unit testing for React code

9&gt; explain what is higher order component, control uncontrolled component in react.

10&gt; Reducer return a new object or old one?

11&gt; Explain diff between store and flux.

12&gt; What is the difference between Virtual DOM and DOM?

13&gt; Describe synthetic events in React. How it is different from Javascript Events.

14&gt; Explain `this.props.children`

15&gt; Differentiate controlled and uncontrolled components in React Js?

16&gt; How to optimize React component to render it less often? (using shouldComponentUpdate to determine if any relevant data changed)
