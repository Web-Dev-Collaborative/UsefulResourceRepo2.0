<h1 id="how-to-find-missing-elements">How to Find Missing Elements</h1>
<p><strong>Translator: <a href="https://github.com/youyun">youyun</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Author: <a href="https://github.com/labuladong">labuladong</a></strong></p>
<p>I have written several articles about mind twisters. Today, let’s look at another interesting question.</p>
<p>The question is simple:</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/missing_elements/title_en.jpg" /></p>
<p>Given an arry of length n, the index should be in <code>[0, n)</code>. Since we have to put <code>n+1</code> number of elements from set <code>[0, n]</code>, there must be one element which can’t fit. Find the missing element.</p>
<p>This question is not hard. It’s easy to think aabout traversing after sorting. Alternatively, using a <code>HashSet</code> to store all the existing elements, and then go through elements in <code>[0, n]</code> and loop up in the <code>HashSet</code>. Both ways can find the correct answer.</p>
<p>However, the time complexity for the sorting solution is O(NlogN). The <code>HashSet</code> solution has O(N) for time complexity, but requires O(N) space complexity to store the data.</p>
<p><strong>Third Solution: Bit Operation</strong></p>
<p>The XOR operation (<code>^</code>) has a special property: the result of a number XOR itself is 0, and the result of a number with 0 is itself.</p>
<p>In addition, XOR operation satisfies the Exchange Law and Communicative Law. For instance:</p>
<p>2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 3 ^ (2 ^ 2) = 3 ^ 0 = 3</p>
<p>We can using these special properties to find the missing element through a smart way. For example, <code>nums = [0,3,1,4]</code>：</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/missing_elements/1.jpg" /></p>
<p>For easier understanding, let’s assume the index increments by 1 (from <code>[0, n)</code> to <code>[0, n]</code>), and let each element to be placed at the index of its value:</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/missing_elements/2.jpg" /></p>
<p>After doing so, all elements and their indices will be a pair except the missing element. If we can find out index 2 is missing, we can find out the missing element subsequently.</p>
<p>How to find out the missing number? <strong>Perform XOR operations to all elements and their indices respectively. A pair of an element and its index will become 0. Only the missing element will be left.</strong></p>
<pre><code>int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int res = 0;
    // XOR with the new index first
    res ^= n;
    // XOR with the all elements and the other indices
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        res ^= i ^ nums[i];
    return res;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="../pictures/missing_elements/3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Because XOR operation fulfills the Exchange Law and the Communicative Law, all pairs of numbers will become 0, left with the missing element.</p>
<p>Till now, the time complexity is O(N), and the space complexity is O(1). This is optimal. <em>Should we stop now?</em></p>
<p>If we think so, we have become restricted by algorithms. The more knowledge we learn, the easier we might fall into stagnant mindsets. There is actually an even easier solution: <strong>Summation of Arithmetic Progression (AP)</strong>.</p>
<p>We can interpret the question in this way: given an arithmetic progression <code>0, 1, 2, ..., n</code> with an missing element, please find out the missing one. Consequently, the number is just <code>sum(0,1,..n) - sum(nums)</code>!</p>
<pre><code>int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    // Formula: (head + tail) * n / 2
    int expect = (0 + n) * (n + 1) / 2;

    int sum = 0;
    for (int x : nums) 
        sum += x;
    return expect - sum;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this is the simplest solution. But honestly, even I didn’t think of this way. It may be hard for an experienced programmers to think in this way, but very easy for a secondary school student to come up with such a solution.</p>
<p><em>Should we stop now?</em></p>
<p>If we think so, we might still need to pay more attention to details. When we use the formula to calculate <code>except</code>, have you thought about <strong>Integer overflow</strong>? If the product is too big and overflowing, the final result must be wrong.</p>
<p>In the previous implementation, we subtract two sums. To avoid overflow, why not perform subtraction while summing up? Similar to our bit operation solution just now, assume <code>nums = [0,3,1,4]</code>, add an index such that elements will be paired up with indices respectively.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/missing_elements/xor.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s subtract each element from its corresponding index, and then sum up the differences, the result will be the missing element!</p>
<pre><code>public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int res = 0;
    // Added index
    res += n - 0;
    // Summing up the differences between the remaining indices and elements
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
        res += i - nums[i];
    return res;
}</code></pre>
<p>Because both addition and subtraction satisfy the Exchange Law and the Communicative Law, we can always eliminate paired numbers, left with the missing one.</p>
<p><em>We can stop by now.</em></p>
