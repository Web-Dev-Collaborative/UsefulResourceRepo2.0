<p>The definition of a prime number seems simple,which is said to be prime number if it can be divided by 1 and itself.</p>
<p>However,don’t think that the definition of prime numbers is simple. I am afraid that few people can write a prime-related algorithm that works really efficiently. Let’s say you write a function like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Returns several primes in the interval [2, n) 
int countPrimes(int n)

// E.g. countPrimes (10) returns 4
// Because 2,3,5,7 is prime numbers</code></pre>
<p>How would you program this function? I think you maybe write like this:</p>
<pre><code>int countPrimes(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
        if (isPrim(i)) count++;
    return count;
}

// Determines whether integer n is prime
boolean isPrime(int n) {
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
        if (n % i == 0)
            // There are other divisibility factors
            return false;
    return true;
}</code></pre>
<p>The time complexity is O (n ^ 2), which is a big problem.<strong>First of all, the idea of using the isPrime function to assist is not efficient; and even if you want to use the isPrime function, there is computational redundancy in writing the algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly talk about <strong>how to write an algorithm if you want to determine whether a number is prime or not</strong>. Just slightly modify the for loop condition in the isPrim code above:</p>
<pre><code>boolean isPrime(int n) {
    for (int i = 2; i * i &lt;= n; i++)
        ...
}</code></pre>
<p>In other words, <code>i</code> does not need to traverse to<code>n</code>, but only to <code>sqrt (n)</code>. Why? let’s take an example, suppose <code>n = 12</code>.</p>
<pre><code>12 = 2 × 6
12 = 3 × 4
12 = sqrt(12) × sqrt(12)
12 = 4 × 3
12 = 6 × 2</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the last two products are the reverse of the previous two, and the critical point of inversion is at <code>sqrt (n)</code>.</p>
<p>In other words, if no divisible factor is found within the interval <code>[[2, sqrt (n)]</code>, you can directly conclude that <code>n</code> is a prime number, because in the interval <code>[[sqrt (n), n]</code> Nor will you find a divisible factor.</p>
<p>Now, the time complexity of the <code>isPrime</code> function is reduced to O (sqrt (N)), ** but we don’t actually need this function to implement the<code>countPrimes</code> function. The above just hope that readers understand the meaning of <code>sqrt (n)</code>, because it will be used again later.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-implementation-countprimes">Efficient implementation <code>countPrimes</code></h3>
<p>The core idea of efficiently solving this problem is to reverse the conventional idea above:</p>
<p>First from 2, we know that 2 is a prime number, then 2 × 2 = 4, 3 × 2 = 6, 4 × 2 = 8 … all are not prime numbers.</p>
<p>Then we found that 3 is also a prime number, so 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, 3 × 4 = 12 … are also impossible to be prime numbers.</p>
<p>Seeing this, do you understand the logic of this exclusion method a bit? First look at our first version of the code:</p>
<pre><code>int countPrimes(int n) {
    boolean[] isPrim = new boolean[n];
    // Initialize the arrays to true
    Arrays.fill(isPrim, true);

    for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) 
        if (isPrim[i]) 
            // Multiples of i cannot be prime
            for (int j = 2 * i; j &lt; n; j += i) 
                    isPrim[j] = false;
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
        if (isPrim[i]) count++;
    
    return count;
}</code></pre>
<p>If you can understand the above code, then you have mastered the overall idea, but there are two subtle areas that can be optimized.</p>
<p>First of all, recall the <code>isPrime</code> function that just judges whether a number is prime. Due to the symmetry of the factors, the for loop only needs to traverse<code>[2, sqrt (n)]</code>. Here is similar, our outer for loop only needs to traverse to <code>sqrt (n)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 2; i * i &lt; n; i++) 
    if (isPrim[i]) 
        ...</code></pre>
<p>In addition, it is difficult to notice that the inner for loop can also be optimized. Our previous approach was:</p>
<pre><code>for (int j = 2 * i; j &lt; n; j += i) 
    isPrim[j] = false;</code></pre>
<p>This can mark all integer multiples of <code>i</code> as<code>false</code>, but there is still computational redundancy.</p>
<p>For example, when <code>n = 25</code> and<code>i = 4</code>, the algorithm will mark numbers such as 4 × 2 = 8, 4 × 3 = 12, and so on, but these two numbers have been marked by 2 × 4 and 3 × 4 that is <code>i = 2</code> and<code>i = 3</code>.</p>
<p>We can optimize it slightly so that <code>j</code> traverses from the square of<code>i</code> instead of starting from <code>2 * i</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for (int j = i * i; j &lt; n; j += i) 
    isPrim[j] = false;</code></pre>
<p>In this way, the algorithm for counting prime numbers is efficiently implemented. In fact, this algorithm has a name, which called Sieve of Eratosthenes. Take a look at the complete final code:</p>
<pre><code>int countPrimes(int n) {
    boolean[] isPrim = new boolean[n];
    Arrays.fill(isPrim, true);
    for (int i = 2; i * i &lt; n; i++) 
        if (isPrim[i]) 
            for (int j = i * i; j &lt; n; j += i) 
                isPrim[j] = false;
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
        if (isPrim[i]) count++;
    
    return count;
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>The time complexity of this algorithm is difficult to calculate</strong>.It is obvious that the time is related to these two nested for loops. The operands should be:</p>
<p>n/2 + n/3 + n/5 + n/7 + … = n × (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7…)</p>
<p>In parentheses, ther is the inverse of the prime number .The final result is O(N * loglogN),and readers interested in this can refer to the time complexity of the algorithm</p>
<p>That is all about how to find prime Numbers.The seemingly simple problem does has a lot of details to polish</p>
