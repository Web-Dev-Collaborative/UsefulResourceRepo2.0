The porpose of this project is to practice the end-to-end process of creating a machine learning model. For the specifics of the model building process check out the [model validation](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/KaggleProjects/blob/master/Project%20Titanic/Model-Evaluation.ipynb) notebook. To see the results of the project, check out my [write up](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/KaggleProjects/blob/master/Project%20Titanic/Write-up.ipynb).
