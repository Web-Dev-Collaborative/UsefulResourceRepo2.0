# Research-Computer-Vision

A running catalogue of my reviews of the literature of computer vision. I will be focusing on reproducing deep learning architectures for the next few months.

My main interests are in convolutional architectures applied to mobile devices. I spend a significant amount of my time researching CNN applications as well as research advances on the compression of neural networks for computer vision.
